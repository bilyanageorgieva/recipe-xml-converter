On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 20x9-inch rectangle. To fill, evenly spread jam on dough to within 1/2 inch of edges. Sprinkle evenly with apricots and almonds. Beginning at long end, roll up tightly. Pinch seam to seal. Form into ring, pinch ends together to seal. Place, seam side down, on large greased baking sheet. With sharp knife, cut slits, starting from outer edge, 3/4 of the way through dough at 1-inch intervals. Turn each section on its side to show filling. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Bake at 350ø for 30 to 35 minutes or until done, covering with foil after 20 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from sheet; let cool on wire rack. Drizzle with icing.

    <title>Apricot Chicken</title>
    <category>Poultry</category>
    <category>Usenet</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Chicken pieces</li>
      <li>1 package French onion soup mix</li>
      <li>2 cups Apricot nectar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Apricot halves (canned)</li>
      <li>Flour (plain)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Dust chicken in flour. Fry chicken lightly until starting to brown. Place chicken in a casserole dish or a very deep frying pan. Add soup powder, nectar and apricots. Mix everything well. Simmer for 1 hour. I normally use 2 pieces of chicken per person and about a 1 1/2 lb can of apricot halves. This will suffice for 4 to 6 people. If you cannot get nectar, then use the juice from the apricot halves. (Of course, if you can buy apricots in nectar...) The French onion soup quantity is not critical, but a soup packet that makes up about 6 C is about right for 4 to 6 people. Serve with potato (baked or boiled), buttered carrots and peas. NOTES: * Chicken embalmed in apricot nectar -- Apricot Chicken is the ultimate bachelors delight. It is very simple and tastes wonderful. The recipe was given to me by a group of friends from back home who came to visit me. Yield: Serves 4-6. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking. : Precision: No need to measure. : Greg Sharp : Dept.

    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Loaf frozen dough</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Margarine; softened</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Brown sugar</li>
      <li>17 ounces Can apricot halves in heavy syrup</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Miniature marshmallows</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Let bread dough completely thaw. On a lightly floured surface, roll thawed loaf into a rectangle approximately 14 by 8". Place rectangle of dough on a greased sheet pan. Spread with 2 tablespoons margarine and 2 tablespoons brown sugar (save remaining margarine and sugar for glaze). Drain the apricots, reserving the liquid for the glaze. Place drained apricot halves lengthwise down center of rectangle. Sprinkle with marshmallows and cinnamon. With sharp knife or scissors, cut dough into strips lengthwise down eachside of rectangle. Make strips 1" wide an 2" deep (or cut in until it almost hits the filling). Gently stretch each strip and criss-cross over filling. Let rise in warm area until puffy, 30 to 60 minutes (see note). While rising make glaze. For glaze, combine remaining sugar and margarine with reserved apricot syrup in a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil. Let boil for 5 minutes. Remove form heat. Set aside. When twist has risen, bake in a preheated 350 oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with glaze. Return twist to oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove from oven, brush with additional glaze. Remove twist from sheet pan to cool on a wire rack. When cool, slice and serve. Note: Twist can be assembled in the evening to rise in the refrigeratior overnight. This enables you to quickly bake it for breakfast in the morning. Simply brush the unrisen twist with some melted margarine and cover with plastic wrap to keep from drying out while in the refrigerator. In the morning, proceed with remaining recipe instructions.

      <li>1/2 pounds Dried apricots</li>

      <li>A few pistachio nuts (opt'l.)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wipe apricots with a damp cloth. Do not soak or wash them, as this would make them too moist. Mince or chop them very finely. Add a few tablespoons confectioners' sugar to taste, and knead thoroughly by hand, wetting your hands from time to time to make a smooth, soft, slightly moist paste. Shape into marble-sized balls. Roll them in confectioners' sugar and let them dry overnight. You can insert half a bright green pistachio nut on top to offset the rich orange of the apricots. A splendid variation is stuffed apricotina. Use 1 tb. ground almonds or finely chopped pistachios mixed with 1 heaping tsp. sugar. Make a small hole in the center of each apricotina. Put in a little of the filling, close the hole again, and roll in confectioners' sugar. From _A Book of Middle Eastern Food_ by Claudia Roden. New York: Random House, Inc., 1974. Pg. 423.

      <li>"Take freshly gathered Apricots not too ripe; to Half their Weight of loaf Sugar, add as much Water as will cover the Fruit; boil and skim it: then put in the Apricots, and let them remain five or six Minutes; take them up without Syruup, and ;ay them on Dishes to cool; boil the Syrup till reduced one Half; when the Apricots are cold, put them in Bottles, and cover them with equal Quantities of syrup and French Brandy. If the Apricots be clingstone, they will require more scalding." Source: Mrs. Mary Randolph's Virginia Housewife, 1831 Posted on Cooking Echo by Karl Lembke on 12-26-92 MM by Cathy Svitek</li>

      <li>Quantity: An average of 16 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 10 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 50 pounds and yields 20 to 25 quarts-an average of 2-1/4 pounds per quart. Quality: Select firm, well-colored mature fruit of ideal quality for eating fresh. Procedure: (Optional--Dip fruit in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds until skins loosen. Dip quickly in cold water and slip off skins). Wash fruit. Cut in half, remove pits and slice if desired. To prevent darkening, keep peeled fruit in ascorbic acid solution. Prepare and boil a very light, light, or medium syrup or pack apricots in water, apple juice, or white grape juice. Raw packs make poor quality apricots. Processing directions for canning apricots in a dial or weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1. Process Times for Apricots (Halved or Sliced) in a Dial-Gauge Pressure Canner. Style of Pack: Hot and Raw. Jar Size: Pints or Quarts. Process Time: 10 min. Canner Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes of 0 - 2,000 ft: 6 lb. 2,001 - 4,000 ft: 7 lb. 4,001 - 6,000 ft: 8 lb. 6,001 - 8,000 ft: 9 lb. Table 2.

Preparation: 1- Mix Preserves, Dressing, and Onion mix 2- Arrange chicken in a baking dish; pour mix over chicken; 3- Marinade 3+ hours, refrigerated. 4- Bake at 325F-350F 45 min to 1 hour, until juices clear. 5- To crisp chicken, cook the last 15 min under the broiler. 6- Prepare rice with parsley; serve chicken over rice. 7- My preference is to bake chicken about 30 min and finish over a med-high grill, basting with some of the sauce and saving some to pour over chicken and rice at serving.

Cover and cook over low heat for about 20 minutes. Uncover and decoaratively arrange the egg slices and raw unpeeled shrimp on the top. (Add more broth as necessary to keep the rice moist. Cover and steam for another 10 minutes until the shrimp are cooked and the rice is tender. (Paella should be moist but not wet!) Place the pan on a hot pad on the serving table and let everyone help themselves. Serve with a mixed green salad, red ripe tomatoes and some French bread. Also mix up a pitcher of Sangria and enjoy!

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cream the butter or margarine with the sugar. Add the four eggs, beating in one at a time. Add 1 tsp vanilla and 3 cups flour. Pour 3/4 of the batter on a greased and floured cookie sheet. Spread can of pie filling over batter. Spoon rest of batter by tsp over top (won't cover completely, just drop at intervals) Bake at 350 for 40-50 minutes. When cool, may sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. Cut into squares. Notes: If using cherry pie filling, may add almonds on top. If using apple pie filling, may add raisins and nuts. I have never tried these variations. I have increased the amount of pie filling and I think I may have doubled the recipe once, using a sheet cake pan. I never add the powdered sugar. I have used blueberry, strawberry, and cherry fillings. These freeze well. Posted to TNT Recipes Digest by NavyDoc &lt;NavyDoc@aol.com&gt; on Mar 23, 1998</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>5,6 lb brisket; 1st cut *Sliced paper thin (3 is not a typo) &gt;&gt;&gt; The following is my favorite brisket recipe and it really does come from my Aunt Sadie's kitchen: Remove any excess fat from brisket, but leave a little on top. Place one half of the onions on bottom of pan. Season the onions with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and lots of Hungarian paprika. Place brisket on top of onions, then other half of onions and allspice on top of the brisket. Cover and roast in a 300 degree F. oven for 3 hours. Test your brisket and when it is fork tender, take it out. Let it cool and then slice it very thin. Strain juice and either thicken it with a little cornstarch or serve it au jus. You will have a very dark brown juice. NOTE: Best when made one day in advance. Aunt Sadie almost always served this with savory noodle kugel. I also serve it with roasted, boiled or mashed potatoes. Use a good roasting pan with a lit that fits well or covered with heavy duty aluminum foil. Spray pan and inside of lid with Pam.&gt;&gt; I serve this at Passover sans cornstarch and serve it any time I wish to serve something festive, special and easy.

      <li>I promised more of Aunt Jeanne's recipes too long ago. I've been serving this lately and everyone wants the recipe. It is important to note there is no cream in "cream-style corn". Delicious topped with a bit of yogurt or sour cream and a "pinch" of caviar with chopped chives.Makes about 40 small pancakes which are easily reheated for 5-10minutes if made ahead. Combine; mix until smooth &amp; drop by spoon into 1/8" cooking oil I tend to thin this down somewhat either with milk for dairy or broth for meat when using as a vegetable rather than an appetizer.

In an enamel or stainless steel preserving kettle combine cider vinegar, sugar and the spices, tied in a cheesecloth bag. (The spice bag should be kept in the syrup right up to the very end.) Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved and boil rapidly for 3 minutes. Pour the syrup over the tomatoes and let stand overnight. Next day, drain off syrup and bring to a boil. Pour over tomatoes and let stand again overnight. On the fourth day, put syrup and tomatoes into the kettle, bring to a boil and simmer until the tomatoes are transparent. Pack the tomatoes into hot jars. Boil the syrup until it becomes quite thick or spins a long thread. Remove the spice bag and pour the syrup over the fruit, filling the jars and seal. Makes 8 Quarts.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 ounces Dry bread, diced</li>
      <li>1/2 ounces (1 Tbsp) butter or lard</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Milk</li>
      <li>3 ounces (3/4 cup) flour</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chervil, marjoram) -</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1 Tbsp chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chervil, marjoram) - optional, but a great improvement You will need a frying pan, a large and a small bowl, and a saucepan of water or soup. Fry the diced bread lightly in the fat in a frying pan. Meanwhile, mix the egg and the milk in a small bowl. Tip the contents of the frying pan into a large bowl, and pour the egg and milk over all. Stir in the flour, and season with salt and pepper. Add the herbs, if using. You may need more milk to make a soft dough. Allow it to stand for 1/2 an hour. Dip your hand into cold water and roll the mixture into a dozen small balls. Put a pot of salted water on to boil, if there isn't a simmering soup pot waiting. Drop little balls of dough into the boiling salted water or the soup. Poach them for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are light and firm and well risen. Yield: 12 dumplings Time: 1 hour Notes: You may include chopped fried bacon or cubed pork cracklings in the mixture. Leaving out flour will result in a lighter dumpling.

      <li>This Australian recipe, a very moist cake, not what we'd call a pudding, has taken Down Under by storm. you'll find it on restaurant and dinner party menus across that country. This version was printed recently by the New York times. TO PREPARE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch round baking pan withsides at least 2 inches high, such as a springform pan. Place the dates in a saucepan and cover with water (about 1-1/2 cups). Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Add the baking soda (the mixture will foam) and set aside. In a bowl, cream the cut up butter, sugar and eggs, adding the eggs one at a time. Gently mix in the flour, salt and vanilla. Stowly stir in the baking powder and 1/4 cup of the liquid from cooking the dates, until the cake mixture resembles thick pancake batter. Drain off remainder of date cooking liquid and discard. Stir in the dates. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked in the center. TO PREPARE CARAMEL SAUCE: Combine the butter, whipping cream, brown sugar and vanilla. Bring to a boil; reduce to simmer, and cook for 3 minutes. TO SERVE: Drizzle some of the sauce over the cake as it is cooling. Serve the rest of the sauce separately.

      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In large mixer bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy. Add oil, vanilla, and egg, beating well. Hy band, stir in oats, corn flakes, and nuts, if desired. Mix well. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to mixture and mix well by hand. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with a fork. Bake for 12 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool for about a minute before removing from pan. Then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Makes about 8 dozen cookies. Personal notes: This recipe is perfect because it tastes like it has nuts but it doesn't. Great for Rebekah's nut allergy. It is a crispy cookie, but not flat.... I used my small cookie dough scoop on this and ended up with about 8-9 dozen cookies...the same size as the Keebler Pecan Sandy. This has a taste very similar to the Keeblers, but no nuts.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Soak a dozen long wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Then push skewers through prawns, lengthwise, from head to tail with only 1 to a skewer. Combine all ingredients in saucepan and cook over medium to low heat, stirring, until butter is completely melted. Dip skewered prawns in the orange sauce and position on oiled grill rack about 4 inches above the coals. Baste liberally with sauce and grill for 2 minutes. Turn the prawn over and baste again, cooking for another 2 minutes. Smaller prawn will be done at this point, but continue basting and turning larger prawn until they are pink and cooked through. Remove from heat immediately when done, as they will get tough of overcooked. Use any remaining sauce for a dip for the prawns. From: The Register Guard, by Edythe Preet, a LA free lance writer.

      <li>Date: Thu, 21 Mar 1996 09:13:22 -0600 From: pickell@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell) Combine the first 4 ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally, until the mixture comes to a full boil. Let it boil for 7 minutes. Turn the heat off and let the syrup cool for 15 minutes. Add the maple flavoring and stir. When completely cool, transfer the syrup to a covered plastic or glass container. Makes: 1 quart Note: For a syrup with a butter flavor, just add 3 Tbsp. of butter to the mixture before heating. For a lighter syrup, use a sugar substitute instead of the sugar. The absence of natural maple syrup in this recipe is not unusual. In fact, there is no real maple syrup in any Aunt Jemima syrups.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The author writes: "Spread on hot buttered toast, this protein-rich snack is ideal for chilled skiers or skaters. Blade steaks, blade roast, cross rib roast and stewing beef are all suitable cuts." Place beef (bones, fat and all) into a large, heavy stockpot with the soup bone, onion, carrot, bay leaf and salt. Cover with cold water and bring to the boil, uncovered. Skim off any foam and cook two hours or more (until beef falls off the bone). Cover pot; let stand in a cool place overnight to solidify fat. Next day, skim off and discard fat, along with carrots, onions and bay leaf. Remove meat from bones and discard bones. Shred beef with a knife. Return shredded meat to stock in the pot; place over high heat. Add pickling spices (tied in bag) and let come to a boil. Add consomme. Once stock is boiling, add gelatin. Stir and let simmer another 1 minute. Spoon stock plus beef into a large mold or ceramic bowl (or two smaller ones) and let sit in refrigerator, several hours or overnight. Good with hot mustard, salt and pepper. Keeps well, refrigerated, 1 week. Yield: 6 to 8 servings. From _Nancy Enright's Canadian Herb Cookbook_ by Nancy Enright.

      <li>Notes: From Kathy Bless, Fayetteville, PA. COUNTRY MAGAZINE. In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast and flour: add butter and mix well. Add egg yolks and sour cream: mix well. Shape into four balls. Place in separate resealable plastic bags or wrap in plastic wrap: refrigerate overnight. In a small bowl, combine sugar, pecans and cinnamon: set aside. On a floured surface, roll each ball of dough into a 9-inch circle. Sprinkle with sugar mixture and apple. Cut each circle into 16 wedges: roll up from wide edge and pinch to seal. Place with point side down on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees for 16-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately remove to wire racks to cool. For icing, combine sugar, milk and vanilla until smooth: drizzle over the twists. Sprinkle with pecans. Yield: 64 twists. EDITOR'S NOTE: The yeast does not need to be dissolved in liquid, and no rising time is necessary before baking. "This recipe has been one of my favorites for years.

Add the diced chicken and pooach gently in the onion- chili- potato mixturer until chicken is cooked through. Remove from the heat immediatly, transfer to a bowl, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid in a small bowl. Refrigerate the remainder to keep the chicken from overcooking.

When the chicken mixture is no longer warm, add the puree. Dice the remaining half of the Anaheim and poblano chilies in half inch cubes and add to the mixture. Season with salt. Reheat just before serving to retain the fresh green color and flovor of the soup. NOTES : This recipe makes a spicy soup with the consistancy of a hearty chicken-vegetable soup.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: mark@alexr.co.uk Date: Sun, 25 Feb 1996 00:00:24 GMT NOTE: Prebaked crusts are much crisper than the chilled ones and this can be important if you want a crisp crust. CRUST: If you are prebaking the shell, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the crumbs in a mixing bowl and add the butter and sugar blending well. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Smooth the mixture to form an even layer on the bottom and sides. Bake the crust in the oven for 10 minutes and let cool to room temperature before filling. NOTE: This crust can be chilled for 5 to 10 minutes in the freezer until it is set but is not recommended in this recipe. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in the flour, lemon rind, lemon juice, and vanilla until just mixed. Whip the cream until stiff in a medium mixing bowl. Set aside. In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, then fold them into the cheese mixture. Fold in the reserved whipped cream. Stir in the passion fruit pulp then pour the mixture into the prepared crust and bake fro 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool, in the oven, to room temperature, then chill.

    <ingredient>
      <li>7 pounds Smithfield Easy Karv Ham (to 9 lbs.); rind removed</li>
      <li>Whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 pound Dark-brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 can Coca-Cola; 12-oz.</li>
      <li>1 can Pineapple rings (14-oz.); drained and juice reserved</li>
      <li>1 cup Sweet Concord grape wine</li>
      <li>10 Maraschino cherries; (10 to 12)</li>
      <li>Fresh bay leaves for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 325 degrees. Using a sharp knife, score surface of ham crosswise and lengthwise, forming a crosshatch pattern about 1/4-inch deep and 1-inch apart. Place 1 clove in the center of each square. Place ham, fat side up, in a double-layer disposable aluminum roasting pan. Pat the brown sugar onto the surface of the ham. Expect some sugar to fall into the roasting pan. Transfer to oven, and bake until brown sugar just begins to melt, about 30 minutes. Pour Coca-Cola over ham, mixing with melted sugar in bottom of roasting pan. Baste ham with sugar mixture. Return to oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1 cup reserved pineapple juice and wine in a small bowl. Baste ham with pineapple mixture. Bake ham for a total of 16 minutes per pound, basting every 20 minutes. During the last 20 minutes of baking time, decorate ham with pineapple rings. Use 2 to 3 toothpicks to hold each ring in place. Center a cherry in the center of each ring, and adhere with a toothpick. Transfer ham to a platter, removing all toothpicks. Garnish ham with fresh bay leaves. Serves 10 to 12.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* For the steaks: they should be 8-10 ounces and 1-inch thick each. Use Swordfish, Halibut or Salmon steaks. 1. In a bowl, combine the lime juice, 1 tablespoon oil, ginger, cayenne pepper and enough freshly ground black pepper to suit your taste. 2. Marinate the fish in the marinade for 45-60 minutes. Turn steaks 2-3 times. 3. Have the grill prepared with white coals and brush the cooking grill with the remaining one tablespoon oil. 4. Grill the fish, brushing several times with the marinade, until cooked through and opaque in the center. Turn fish after about 4-5 minutes. Total grilling time will depend on your grill and the heat of the coals. * To broil instead, use a broiler pan brushed with oil and broil until center is opaque. Will take about 10 minutes total in broiler. Turn steaks after 5 minutes, and baste often with marinade.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 cups Butter</li>

      <li>3 Eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>4 ounces Cottage cheese</li>

      <li>12 ounces Pineapple, crushed, with juice</li>
      <li>Cornflake crumbs, to top</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt butter in a 9x13 pan. Add noodles. Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over noodles. Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour. NOTES: * Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting because you don't cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6. * This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first. It also comes out very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking. : Precision: no need to measure. : susan@sftig.UUCP (S.Eisen) : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust : AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Summit, NJ From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Rich, this is an old favorite of mine, from my great-grandmother. Thought everyone would enjoy it. I love them, and so does the rest of my family. They were always part of Christmas baking for us. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine shortening, oats, flour, sugar, raisins, milk, cinnamon, soda and salt. It should stick together when you squeeze a small amount in your hand. Drop small amounts on sheet. Bake 10 minutes. Hope you try them, they are the best I've ever tasted, though I'm probably biased.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Remove rind from pork and trim fat to make a 1 cm layer. Roll and tie the meat. Weight pork and calculate cooking time, allow 25-30 mins. per 500 gr. Place meat in roasting pan. Roast pork for 30 mins. Combine coffee, 1/4 c. cream, 1/4 c port &amp; sugar, pour over pork. Continue roasting pork for calculated cooking time, basting pork every 15 mins with coffee mixture. This basting gives the outside a beautiful golden glaze &amp; helps to keep the meat moist. Remove pork from oven when cooked. Keep covered in a warm place while making the sauce. Skim fat from the pan juices. Place juices in a small saucepan with water, remaining 1/4 c cream, remaining port and cornstarch. Cook until thickened, strain. Slice pork thinly and place a tablespoon or two of sauce on each serving. Remaining sauce should be available for guests to add more.

      <li>Serves: 6 Cooking time: 1 to 1-1/4 hours Sift flour and salt into a bowl, add water and mix to a firm dough, adding more flour if necessary. Divide into 2 balls and wrap in plastic. Rest for 30 minutes. On a floured board roll out each ball of dough very thinly. Cut into 5 mm (1/4-inch) strips either while it is flat or by rolling up each sheet of dough and slicing with a sharp knife. Place noodles on a floured cloth, dust with flour and leave to dry for about 30 minutes. Wash split peas well and place in a pan with 1-1/2 cups cold water. Bring to the boil and boil gently for 30 minutes or until tender. Add red beans and liquid and keep warm. In a large pot bring 8 cups water to the boil, add 2 teaspoons salt, oil and noodles. Put noodles in gradually, stirring after each addition. Return to the boil and cook uncovered for 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook for further 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and return to the pot. Add split peas and bean mixture with its liquid, toss ingredients lightly and keep hot over low heat. In a frying pan heat the 1/2 cup oil, fry onion until soft and add ground meat. Stir over high heat until juices evaporate and meat browns lightly. Add salt and pepper to taste, tomato puree and water, cover and simmer 10 minutes, then remove cover and let moisture evaporate. Sauce should be oily. Combine chakah ingredients, add to noodles and toss well. Mixture should be moist. Place noodle mixture in a deep dish and top with keema. Stir at the table and serve in deep plates. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 can Ff vegetarian refried beans</li>
      <li>1 12 oz bottle mild taco</li>
      <li>Sauce</li>
      <li>2 cans Stewed tomatoes, one</li>
      <li>Drained, one not</li>
      <li>1 cup Ff cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup Corn kernels, frozen is ok</li>
      <li>10 To 12 lasagne noodles,</li>
      <li>Uncooked</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Black olives, sliced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a bowl mix beans with about half the juice from one can of tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of taco sauce. You want the beans to be almost but not quite pourable. Mix the rest of the taco sauce and tomato juice and set aside. Put about a quarter of the taco sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13" lasagne pan. Cover sauce with a layer of noodles. Layer, in any order you want, the beans, corn, cheese, drained tomatoes, sauce and noodles, being sure to end up with enough beans to cover the top with no noodles showing. The resulting mess should be pretty wet. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350 for about an hour, until the noodles are tender. Check every 5-10 minutes after 45 minutes of cooking to see how the noodles are doing. Remove foil, sprinkle with olives. Bake another couple of minutes. Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving. Serves 3-4 as a main dish. Tastes even better the next day. Variation: If you want to pre-cook the noodles, don't use as much tomato juice and cook for only about 30 minutes. Variation: Other veggies would work well in here too. What do you have in the frig? Variation: You could top it with a little ff cheese-stuff in the last few minutes. And no doubt you could make it vegan by leaving off all milk products altogether. From Katherine Albitz, kra@sdd.hp.com. Fatfree Digest [Volume 10 Issue 23], Sept. 2, 1994.

Just spread mix in pan and cook uncovered. Use a pancake turner to cut and remove cooked 'burger'.*** Mash beans. Add all ingredients and mix well. (If you use all of the ingredients listed your mix may be a bit dry. You might want to add a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of soy, nut, or rice milk. Of coarse you also could use whole milk. Be sure you don't thin it too much or it will be mushy. Look for a 'hamburger' consistency.) Spoon about 2 heaping Tablespoons of mix onto grill or frypan for each burger and flatten with greased pancake turner. Turn several times rather than just once on each side like conventional burgers, they have a better texture that way. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Date: Fri, 22 Mar 1996 11:27:46 -0500 (EST) From: halsalhb@UCBEH.SAN.UC.EDU (h brian halsall) Dice the chiles, peel and smash the garlic, coarsely chop the cilantro (flavour is lost if chopped fine), and combine everything, with all can juices, except the sherry in a large casserole. Bake at 350 until bubbling gently (about 1/2 hour). Stir in the sherry, and serve. Do not cook longer, otherwise the textures will be lost. Salsa Cruda: Coarsely chop equal parts tomatoes, white onions, peppers (yellow/red bells plus jalapenos/serranos/habaneros - adjust amount depending on the heat level desired). Pack with juice of two limes per pint of pack and salt to taste. Pressure can for storage, or simmer gently for about 10 min and refrigerate. Simmering can be omitted if a crunchy salsa is desired.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 ounces Bean thread noodles -or-</li>
      <li>1 cup Cooked rice; or less</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Fresh spinach</li>
      <li>8 ounces Tofu Mori-nu lite firm</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>INTRO: Serves 4. This simple but delicious and nutritious soup is one you would often find on the table in China. Use soft bean curd: its custard-like texture and mild flavor works with the sugar to neutralize the metallic edge of the spinach. The bean thread noodles give substance to this warming dish. PREP: Soak the noodles in a large bowl of warm water for 15 minutes. When soft, drain them and discard the water. Cut the noodles into 3-inch lengths using scissors or a knife. Remove the stalks from the spinach and wash the leaves well. Gently cut the bean curd into 1-inch cubes. Put the stock into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the bean thread noodles and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the spinach and the rest of the ingredients except the bean curd. Simmer for 2 minutes, then gently put in the bean curd. Continue to simmer the soup for 2 more minutes to heat the bean curd through and serve at once. Source: Asian Vegetarian Feast (HardCover 1988) by Ken Hom. William Morrow and Company, Inc. New York.

      <li>2 Green onions</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Minced garlic</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Slice bean curd into 1/4" cubes; sliver green onions. In hot wok, heat oil just to point of smoking. Add bean curd, green onions and garlic. Stir gently to avoid breaking up curd; turn pieces to coat with oil. Be sure oil is not too hot or curd will tend to stick to pan. When aroma of garlic is apparent, add stock and bring to boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 30 seconds (don't let curd fall apart). Remove cover; stir in oyster sauce and sugar. Increase heat, and when liquid boils again, add enough cornstarch paste to make a creamy (but not too thick) sauce. Swirl in peanut oil to make a glaze. Serve over rice or in a shallow serving bowl.

    <ingredient>
      <li>10 large (10") tortillas or chapatis</li>
      <li>1 cup Dried pinto beans, soaked</li>
      <li>Overnight in 3 cups water</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups TVP granules or flakes</li>
      <li>1/2 cups (less 1 T.) hot water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Oregano</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Onion, chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Drain, rinse and cook the beans until tender (70-90 minutes) in 3 cups of water with the bay leaf and garlic. Drain the beans, but reserve the liquid in case it is needed later to thin the filling mixture. Combine the TVP, hot water, hot bean liquid, chili powder, cumin, salt and oregano. Saute the onion in the olive oil in a good sized skilled until softened. Add the seasoned TVP and cook a few minutes more. Stir in the cooked beans, then transfer mixture to a food processor or blender and mash to a fairly smooth textured filling, adding a little of the bean liquid if mixture is too thick. Taste and add a little hot sauce if desired. If done in a blender, you may need to do it in two batches, then mix the batches together. To assemble: heat a griddle or skillet until a few drops of water dance on the surface. Dry fry each tortilla on both sides until the surface of the tortilla begins to bubble and brown slightly. Keep them warm in a thick towel. When all are heated, place about 1/3 cup of filling down one side of a tortilla and roll up. You may wish to enclose or serve with side dishes of shredded lettuce, grated soy cheese, salsa sauce or sliced avocados. Burritos may be made ahead, kept wrapped, and baked before serving. Unwrap, place on cookie sheet, bursh tops lightly with oil if desired and bake at 350 degrees about 20 minutes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation Time: 2:07 This may be made without the brown rice; use 5 cups mashed cooked and drained beans instead. The sauce can also be used in other Mexican recipes. To make the enchilada sauce combine all ingredients in a saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, about 7 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the enchilada sauce in the bottom of a covered casserole dish. Take one tortilla at a time and spread some beans, rice, and scallons down the center. Roll up and place seam-side-down in the casserole dish. Repeat until all ingredients are used. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the rolled-up tortillas, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.

      <li>Date: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 15:54:44 -0400 From: LRLady@aol.com (Ruth Hoffman, Lake Zurich, IL, LRLady@aol.com) I bought a vegan cookbook at a used-book store not long ago, and we've been enjoying some yummy recipes from it. It's a British book, called The Vegan Gourmet by Heather Lamont. Not fatfree, but usually low fat and mostly easy to modify. Here's my version of a delicious dish I adapted from this book recently. Aussies will recognize a familiar ingredient--Vegemite, also known as yeast extract. For those who don't know what it is, it's *definitely* an acquired taste, and not one I would go to any trouble to acquire. But our son brought back a jar of the stuff from Australia, and I figured, what the heck, we only go around once. (Original called for 1 Tbsp; could probably be eliminated, but I suspect it added to the richness and complexity of the flavor without being identifiable.) Saute onions in broth for 5 minutes. Add carrots, celery, leek, and garlic and saute for 5 more minutes. Add kidney beans, tomatoes with their juice, stock, yeast extract, and salt and pepper. Mix well. Place in casserole dish. Arrange potatoes over the top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spray lightly with cooking spray and cover casserole. Place in oven (350 deg F, 180 deg C, Mk 4) for 2 hours. Remove lid for last 30 minutes to brown potatoes. Serves 4 hungry people, or maybe 6 with a generous side dish. (I tend to get lazy and do one-dish meals.) Or 2, if you want to save the leftovers for tomorrow night. This was scrumptious! I might try adding a layer of portabella mushrooms in the middle, next time. (Maybe my son will think they are meat...:-)). But it didn't really need any help of any kind. The leftovers are good, too! FATFREE DIGEST V96 #113 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

      <li>Revised after testing Feb 94. Used 1 1/2 cup flour NOT 2 1/2 cups as printed in the book. The 1 cup beans probably replaced 1 cup flour in the original recipe. Stir dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles crumbs. In food processor or blender, puree beans with milk. OR mash beans and stir in milk. Stir into dry ingredients all at once to make light soft dough. Turn out onto lightly floured board, sprinkle with flour and knead about 20 seconds.

    <category>Vegan</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: INGREDIENTS</li>
      <li>8 large Flour Tortillas, 10"</li>
      <li>2 cups Black or pinto beans</li>
      <li>1 cup Vegetarian Chili Mix (TVP)</li>
      <li>7/8 cups Water, or white grape juice</li>
      <li>1 Medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>Garnish:</li>
      <li>Diced tomatoes, black olives</li>
      <li>Guacamole, diced onions,</li>
      <li>Picante Sauce</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Method: Heat water or juice to boiling and pour over TVP in a heatproof bowl. Allow to sit for 10 minutes until water is absorbed. Add beans with juice to TVP. Saute onions in a little water or juice until soft. Lay out your tortillas flat, and divide bean-TVP mixture evenly among the 8 tortillas. Then fold the tortilla up from the bottom, down from the top, and then fold the two ends to the middle. "Pin" them with a toothpick. Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray, place the "envelopes" on the cookie sheet, and spray them with the cooking spray. Place in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes until crisp and slightly browned. Take the toothpicks out when baked - they will stay in shape. Use what you need, and freeze the rest in plastic freezer bags. When ready to serve, heat in oven or microwave and top with tomatoes and onions - guacamole and black olives, picante sauce as desired.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 cups Beans; cooked</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Onion; minced</li>
      <li>4 ounces Green chili peppers; canned diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Vinegar; cider preferred</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 dash Tobasco sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cumin powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Oregano; crushed, dried</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Chili powder</li>
      <li>2 cups Grated cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>drain freshly cooked hot beans and toss into food processor with remaining ingredients. Process until cheese is melted and mixture is smooth. Taste, adding additional vinegar and or seasoning to taste. Serve hot with chips or tortillas. Serves well in a cock pot or bean pot heated in an oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The heavy ceramic hold heat and keeps the dip warm longer. Can also be used as a sandwich filling or burrito filling. Original recipe by Roberta Bishop Johnson, Champaign, Illinois. Variations by Vaughan "Whole Foods for the Whole Family", La Leche League International Cookbook ISBN 0-912500-09-3 Recipe By : also called "Somethings Wrong With This) Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #222 Date: Sat, 21 Sep 1996 09:27:42 -0800 From: Ken Vaughan &lt;kvaughan@ptialaska.net&gt; NOTES : Beans can be pinto, red, pink, kidney. Black beans also work well Green Chilis are optional. Use Jalapanos if there are chili heads to be fed. Cheese can be cheddar, colby, jack, etc. Fetta works well as does mixed cheeses. Vinegar amount can vary from 1 to 4 tablespoons depending on the amount of chili Tobasco and chili powder are optional (for not-chili-heads) I like a chipolte chili or two in this for heat and flavor Author noted that family thought there was something wrong with the flavor of the dip, but could not identify it until the dip was gone -- and what was wrong was the dip was gone.</li>

      <li>4 Garlic Cloves</li>
      <li>2 Jalapeno Peppers *</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oregano; dried</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chili Powder</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Coriander Leaves; chopped</li>
      <li>6 ounces Monterey Jack Cheese; grated</li>

      <li>1 Tomato; medium, chopped</li>
      <li>1 Lettuce; shredded</li>
      <li>1 Salsa</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Servings: 4 Rinse lentils and beans, discarding any that look suspicious, and soak in clean water 4 - 6 hours, or overnight. Put into medium saucepan, bring to boil and simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Add water if necessary. Peel and chop onion. Microwave on "High" 2 - 2 1/2 minutes until soft. [If you prefer, you may saute the onion in about 2 T. oil. I omit the oil to keep the fat content down. The flavour does not seem to suffer.] Chop the Jalapena pepper. (*) Adjust the quantity to your own taste and / or tolerance. Peel and crush the garlic. Drain the lentil-bean mixture. Reserve 1/2 cup of liquor. In a food processor puree the lentil-bean mixture, the onion, the garlic, the jalapena peppers, the oregano, the chile powder, and the coriander leaves, adding some of the reserved liquor as necessary to process. [The final puree should be quite thick.] Pre-heat the oven to 325 F. Assemble as follows on an oven-proof plate, pizza-pan or cookie-sheet: Place a flour tortilla on the *lightly* greased surface. Cover with lentil-bean puree [4 - 5 T.]. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Add another flour tortilla and repeat, saving enough cheese to cover the top of the final flour tortilla. Bake for 20 - 30 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to "firm-up" for 5 - 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with salsa, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce. Serve with rice, Couscous and / or corn. The amount of oregano, coriander leaves, chile powder, or jalapena peppers may be varied to suit individual tastes. I use more peppers! If you're prone to "problems" with beans, add 1/4 - 1/2 t. Hing [Hing is a mixture of rice-flour, turmeric and asafoetida &lt;ass-uh-fuh-TEE-duh&gt; found in most East-Indian specialty stores. It can significantly reduce flatulence.

      <li>1 can Pinto beans, 16 oz waterpak</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown rice; cooked</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Onions; frozen, chopped</li>

      <li>Lettuce, chopped</li>
      <li>1 bunch Scallions; chopped</li>
      <li>1 Tomato; chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Saute the frozen onions and green peppers in a few tablespoons of water in a skillet. Drain and rinse the beans and place in a skillet and mash with a potato masher. Add the cooked rice, corn, spices and water. Heat 5 to 10 minutes until most of water is absorbed, stirring occasionally. Heat the tortillas quickly (just to soften) in a preheated skillet, a toaster oven, or a microwave. Place a line of bean mixture down the middle of each tortilla, add a teaspoon of salsa and any of the other toppings as desired. Fold up 1/2 inch on each side, tuck in the top edge and roll into a burrito. Serve immediately, topped with additional salsa if desired. The leftover bean mixture can be kept in the refrigerator and reheated in the microwave prior to assembly. The bean mixture can be adapted by changing the kind of beans (try kidney beans) or omitting the corn, or adding your favorite ingredient. I got more servings out of the recipe than the book got out of the original recipe, so I guess I put less mixture on each tortilla.

      <li>While in Key West over the summer I was fortunate enough to be exposed to some amazing Cuban food. When I returned home at the end of the summer I applied these new ideas to my own kitchen. My personal favorite is Black beans, rice, and lettuce burritos! Bring the black beans to a simmer in their own juices. Use fresh garlic and slice it very fine so it nearly dissappears when you add it to the beans with the pepper After abouit five miuntes add the onions. When serving use twice as much rice as beans and about a third as much lettuce, all wrapped in a nice flour. tortilla. Easy Huh?

      <li>Drain liquid off the lentils, and mix with kidney beans (not drained) in a casserole dish. Drain about 2/3 the juice from the tomatoes, and add to the beans. It is important to do this, because it gets too "soupy" if there is too much liquid. Add cheese and seasoning. Bake in 350 degree F oven for 30 to 45 minutes. (till heated through) NOTE: you can alter the seasoning to whatever you want. Try curry or Mexican seasoning for a variation.

      <li>x Beans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>How many beans to serve how many? As a rough rule, a pound of dried legumes will yield 8 moderate servings. Getting them ready: Spread beans on a big pan or plate and pick out any rubbish-especially small pebbles-and broken beans. Rinse in a colander. To soak or not? Lentils don't need to be soaked and neither do split peas. All other dried legumes need soaking, especially if they have spent some time on the shelf. Soaking how-tos: The basic way: Cover with water to twice the depth of the beans and leave for 4 hours (most kinds) or up to 24 hours, with changes of water, for fava beans or other tough-skinned types. Drain, then cook in fresh water. Quick-soaking or parboiling: Cover with plenty of water, bring to boiil and boil for 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside, covered for 1 hour. Drain and cook in fresh water. Cooking: This varies widely among beans. The newest crop may cook in as little as half the time needed by long-stored beans. The rule is to cook beans at a gentle simmer, partly covered, until a sample is tender to the tooth. Depending on bean kind and age, this may take as little as 45 minutes or as long as 3 hours; fava beans may need even longer. When to salt: Wait until the beans are tender. Salting before that point will toughen them permanently. (wrv) From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Bean Burritos #1</title>
    <category>Vegetable</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Refried beans from two pounds of beans</li>
      <li>12 large Flour tortillas</li>
      <li>8 ounces Shredded cheese</li>
      <li>1 large Onion; chopped fine</li>
      <li>Chopped peppers as desired</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Now that you've made a big bowl of refried beans, you're probably wondering what to do with them. I always turn them into a big batch of bean burritos which can be microwaved on demand for a quick, cheap, filling meal. All ingredients besides the beans and tortillas should be considered optional. Decide what you like in your burritos and add it in. Get the tortilla wraps to room temperature and separate them. Make sure they can be folded without cracking; if this is a problem it may help to warm them in a microwave a bit. For each burrito: 1. Lay one tortilla on your working surface. Spoon exactly one twelfth of the bean mixture onto the center of the tortilla in a roughly rectangular blob. Sprinkle some cheese &amp; onion on the bean mixture. 2. Fold in the tortilla to form the two ends of the burrito. Fold one of the side flaps over the top and around the other side of the bean mix; you'll almost tuck it in under the bean mix so as to force the burrito into a round shape. Fold the other side over. [If you can't understand what to do from these instructions don't sweat it too much; as long as you completely enclose the filling you're okay, and it's not hard to figure out your own folding method.] Set the burrito aside with these folded sides on the bottom. These freeze quite nicely. Two of these large ones (or one with side dishes) makes a meal. You could of course make smaller ones using the smaller wraps, though I'm not sure how many you'll get. An excellent variation is to brown a half pound to a pound of ground beef or turkey, drain it, and stir it into the refried beans before assembling burritos. -- Kenneth Herron kherron@ms.uky.edu University of Kentucky +1 606 257 1429 Dept. of Mathematics "If you ever drop your keys in a river of molten lava, let 'em go because, man, they're gone."

      <li>Preheat oven 350 degrees. Saute onions/garlic in stock/white wine. Combine with beans, cracker meal, egg whites, parsley, vinegar, seasonings. Mash well with fork until blended, but not entirely smooth. (Here I depart from recipe...I make up a bunch of hamburger sized patties, freeze some, refridge some, and cook them as needed for about 20 minutes in a toaster oven...I know they are done when the egg/bread crumbs are brown and the patty is a bit dry. I find this basic recipe can absorb many, many changes.I've used white beans, black beans, whatever, sauteed mushrooms, hot sauce, catsup, etc. The main thing is to get a good texture/cohesiveness in the final product, so it sticks together.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine milk and egg yolks. Sift together dry ingredients and add to milk/egg mixutre. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into mixture. Heat aebleskiver pan and put about 1 tsp oil in each cup of the pan. when very hot, pour enough batter in each cup to almost fill it. Use knitting needle (or any pointed tool) to turn aebleskivers. Keep turning them until golden brown. Add shortening as needed for each new batch. Makes about 3 dozen. This recipe was a huge hit at my summer beach house -- we had it every Saturday! We top them with powdered sugar, fresh berries, and whipped cream. Good luck finding the pans -- mine was a gift. I later found one more at a discount cooking store at the shore. However, this year I searched the shore and the Washington area and have yet to find another. The store managers of the discount places say they never know what they are going to get. Since my first one came from some catalogue (they don't even sell them anymore!) you might try calling a very high end cookware store and seeing if they can order you one. The pans are cast-iron, so you'd need a distributor of cast-iron cookware. (Hmm -- you could also check the manufacturer of whatever is in the stores and call the company directly.) Let me know if you have any success. By the way -- I started making these because my husband is Dutch, and Holland considers aebleskivers ~- which they call "Poffritches" -- a great delicacy!

      <li>Mix sugars. Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes. Let it cool down. (For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later be used with a mixer.) Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of the sugars. Using mixer add to milk. Then (still using mixer) add alcohol slowly. (The result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.) Bottle and let rest for two weeks to let the mixture thicken. Notes: Advokaat is the Dutch word for "egg cognac". It is highly recommended for A. I. (Alcohol Imbibing) meetings. This recipe is my modification of a recipe I obtained in Poland. It makes a potent, superb advokaat (or egg - cognac). The milk and eggs are healthy, the sugar and alcohol are not. This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a spoon: it is quite thick.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 tb of the olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 tb of the garlic and cook until tender, 1-2 minutes; do not brown. Add the sun-dried tomato and stir with garlic. Add the white wine, cooking until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in the whipping or heavy cream; continue cooking until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Puree the sauce in batches. Place about half the sauce in a blender and close the cover, leaving the small, removable feeder cap in the center slightly open to let heat escape. Place a kitchen towel over the cover. Hold the feeder cap in place and pulse mixture and puree until smooth. (Pureeing a hot mixture can cause a heat buildup that can blow the lid off a blender.) Pour the pureed sauce into a bowl and repeat procedure with remaining sauce. Reserve all sauce. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 1 tb olive oil over medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tb garlic and cook until tender, 1-2 minutes; do not brown garlic. Add the mushrooms, cooking until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the red or yellow pepper, cooking until just warmed, about 3 minutes. Add the reserved sauce. Stir in 2 tb of the chives and adjust seasonings if necessary; keep warm. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook Monster Pasta until al dente, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander. Add the pasta to the skillet with the sauce and mix gently to combine. To serve, evenly divide and mound the pasta in the centers of eight warm, rimmed soup plates. Evenly divide the remaining 2 tb chives over each serving. Sprinkle each serving with 1 tb tb of Parmesan cheese and serve. 627 cal; 31 gr fat; 45% fat. Continued in Part 2. Source: The Detroit Free Press. MM Waldine Van Geffen vghc42a@prodigy.com.

      <li>Author's note: Adolph Frey owns one of the few Michelin-rated 2-star restaurants in Germany. He made this dish at the lodge for Carl's birthday celebration 1 year. Quenelles are poached fish-&amp;-egg mounds traditionally made w/pike. To make quenelles, grind pike in food processor, or use a tamis if you have one. Set aside. Bring water to a boil. Sift in flour &amp; stir until water is absorbed. Keep stirring so that mixture doesn't stick to pan. Remove from heat &amp; beat in 1 egg. Cool mixture, then refrigerate until cold. Remove mixture from refrigerator &amp; blend it in food processor until smooth. This is the panade. Cream butter in small bowl. Put ground pike in bowl that is set inside another bowl of ice. Season w/salt &amp; pepper, mix in panade, &amp; gradually add other whole egg &amp; all egg yolks. When blended well, add butter. This can be done in food processor if all ingreds are kept cold. Chill mixture for 30 mins. To make white sauce, place chicken stock in heavy saucepan over medium heat. Bring to simmer, then reduce heat &amp; continue to simmer on low until stock is reduced down to 1 cup liquid, abt. 45 mins. In large saucepan over med. heat, reduce cream until it begins to thicken, whisking occasionally. whisk thickened cream into stock, adding more or less cream, deepending on desired consistency. Season w/salt &amp; pepper to taste. Strain sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, if desired. Makes 2 cups. To assemble dish, shape quenelles by mounding mixture between 2 warmed spoons. Set each quenelle on floured surface. Preheat oven to 400F. Butter baking dish large enough to hold quenelles. In wide saucepan, bring 3 qts water to a boil &amp; poach quenelles for 15 mins w/o letting water boil. Drain thoroughly. arrange quenelles in prepared baking dish. Nap quenelles w/enough white sauce to cover. Sprinkle w/Parmesan. Bake for 15-20 mins, unti cheese browns. Serve 2-3 quenelles per diner.

    <recipetext>
      <li>A couple of months back there was a discussion on how to make Aebleskiver. As a lover of Aebleskiver it really hurt me to see how "distorted" some of these reci pes were. So when I bought the book "Mad", by Ingeborg Suhr from 1942 I decided to enlighten you poor netters. The following three recipes are from the country where Aebleskiver originated and are the "real thing". Although Ingeborg Suhr does not say anything about it I would suggest serving with either sifted confectioners sugar, blackberry jam or both. At Christmas I would suggest serving with glogg. Sift baking soda with flour. Mix all ingredients cold. Bake immediately (see Aebleskiver #1). Fill holes in pan completely.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Dry red chiles</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Coriander seeds</li>
      <li>2 ounces Cumin</li>
      <li>1 ounce Turmeric</li>
      <li>1 ounce Mustard seeds</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the heavy influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders are made from different proportions of spices, dried and ground. Spices can be dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low temperature oven, or on top of the stove in a dry skillet. If using a skillet be sure to shake the spices constantly so they don't burn. Grinding is usually done with a mortar and pestle. Curry powders are not necessarily hot, they are made that way by the addition of chili peppers. Dry spices, grind to a powder and seal in an airtight container. Use 2 teaspoons of curry powder to every 400 g or 1 lb of fish.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Vanilla sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups Milk</li>
      <li>9 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Grain alcohol (95-percent)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix sugars. Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes. Let it cool down. (For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later be used with a mixer.) Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of the sugars. Using mixer add to milk. Then (still using mixer) add alcohol slowly. (The result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.) Bottle and let rest for two weeks to let the mixture thicken. NOTES: * Egg-cognac: a potent sweet alcoholic beverage -- Advokaat is the Dutch word for egg cognac. It is highly recommended for A. I. (Alcohol Imbibing) meetings. This recipe is my modification of a recipe I obtained in Poland. It makes a potent, superb advokaat (or egg-cognac). The milk and eggs are healthy, the sugar and alcohol are not. Yield: Serves 4-8. * This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a spoon; it is quite thick. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 5 minutes preparation, 2 weeks aging. : Precision: Measure the ingredients. : Laurent Siklossy : Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands : siklossy@cs.vu.nl : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Adobo De Chile Passila</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 small Garlic Bulbs; Broken And Unpeeled</li>
      <li>12 large Pasilla Chiles; Dried</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Mexican Oregano; Dried</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Black Pepper; Freshly Ground</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cumin Seed; Freshly Ground</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. THE GARLIC AND THE CHILES. Set a heavy ungreased skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast to a sweet mellowness, turning occasionally, until soft when pressed between your fingers (you'll notice it has blackened in a few small spots), about 15 minutes. cool, then slip off the papery skins and roughly chop. While the garlic is roasting, break the stems off the chiles, tear the chiles open and shake nd/or pick out all the seeds; for themildest sauce, be careful to remove all the stringy, light-colored veins. Next toast the chiles (to give them a richer flavor) a few at a time on your mediium-hot skillet or griddle; Open them flat, lay them on the hot surface skin-side up, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (if the temperature is right you'll hear a faint crackle), then flip them. (If you pressed them just long enought, they'll have changed to a mottled tan underneath. If you see a slight wisp of smoke, it's okay, but any more than that will mean burnt chiles and bitter taste) Now, press down again to toast the other side (you won't notice as much change in color on the skin side). Transfer the toasted chiles to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. pour off the water, reserving about 2/3 cup. 2. THE PUREE. If you're using whole spices, pulverize the oregano with the pepper and cumin in a mortar or spice grinder, then transfer the ground spices to a food processor or blender, along with the drained chiles, the garlic and the reserved soaking liquid. Process to a medium-smooth, thick puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds. (If you're using a blender and the mixture won't move through the blades, add water a little at a time until everything is moving, but still as thick as possible. Not only is a soupy misture a watery, uninteresting marinade, but the pureeing capabilities of the blender are much reduced when too much liquid is added.) Taste and season with salt ADVANCE PREPARATION - Covered and refrigerated, the seasoning will keep for a week or more, it can be successfully frozen. OTHER CHILES YOU CAN USE - While this recipe looks similar to that for ancho, the fact that it used the soaking liquid and more garlic gives it a balance just right for pasilla. Mulato could work here, though it doesn't have the roundness of pasilla. As with Ancho Chile Seasoning Paste, you can embroider pasill with a chipotle for a smoky edge. TRADITIONAL DISHES THAT USE THIS ESSENTIAL AS A STARTING POINT - Spicy Pasilla-Mushroom Tacos, Layered Pasilla-Tortilla Casserole, Seared Lamb in Swarthy Pasilla-Honey Sauce NOTES : Pasilla is one of the most sophisticated chile flavors; pungent and tangy, deeply rich and woodsy. When you're used to using the gentler Ancho Seasoning Paste, graduate to pasilla. The techniques for making it are the same as those ou encounter with the ancho seasoning. Here, we accentuate and balance their muscley, less-sweet flavor by using their soaking water, adding more garlic and elaborating their woodsiness with mroe herbs, fewer spices. The near black pasilla tastes perfect with plack beans, mushrooms and richer meats like lamb and duck. Its spicy pungency becomes more focused when dark sugar or honey are part of the finished dish. If you enjoy reich, bold flavors, you'll love dishes made from pasilla.

      <li>Carole Peck Owner/Executive Chef The Good News Cafe, Woodbury CT; Author, The Buffet Book (Viking Penguin 1997) "I do not believe there is one food that is an aphrodisiac, but some dishes can be so comforting that they make you more relaxed and in a more loving mood." To cook the lobster fill an 8-10 quart pot three-fourths full with water. Add the thyme, parsley, peppercorns, and bay leaf. Squeeze in the juice of the lemons, then drop them in the pot. Cover and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Add the lobsters and cook 12 to 15 minutes. Drain the lobsters in a colander, cover with ice, and let cool. When the lobster is cool enough to handle, pull the tail from the body and remove the claws. Discard the body, or reserve for use in a sauce or stock. Cut the shell from the tail using a knife or scissors and remove the meat. With the blunt end of a knife chop off the tips of the claws as close to the ends as possible (this will help release the meat from the claws). Crack the claws in the center, break open, and carefully remove the claw meat without breaking apart. Meat from the larger claws will have a piece of cartilage in it; this can be pulled out from the area where the claw fingers meet. Cut the tail meat into 1/2 inch slices. Leave the claws whole to use as a garnish. Set the lobster meat aside until ready to assemble the pasta dish. To cook the pasta, fill a 6 to 8 quart pot with water, add salt, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the penne and stir. Cook the pasta for approximately 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Pour into a colander to drain. Do not rinse the pasta; just toss it to remove any excess water. Sprinkle the oil over the pasta and toss with a large chef's fork. Pour the pasta onto a sheet tray or shallow dish to cool (if it looks too sticky, sprinkle some more oil on at this point). Let the pasta cool to room temperature. When the pasta is cooled pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Toss the cooled pasta in a bowl with the Parmesan and provolone cheese, spinach, heavy cream, and lobster meat (except claws). Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large round, oval, or oblong baking dish and bake for approximately 25 minutes, until bubbling hot. Garnish with the lobster claws and truffle slivers (if using). Posted to recipelu-digest by molony &lt;molony@scsn.net&gt; on Mar 04, 1998</li>

    <title>Aebleskiver #1</title>
    <category>Bread</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>250 Grams flour</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>7/16 Liter light cream or milk</li>
      <li>25 Grams yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>A couple of months back there was a discussion on how to make Aebleskiver. As a lover of Aebleskiver it really hurt me to see how "distorted" some of these reci pes were. So when I bought the book "Mad", by Ingeborg Suhr from 1942 I decided to enlighten you poor netters. The following three recipes are from the country where Aebleskiver originated and are the "real thing". Although Ingeborg Suhr does not say anything about it I would suggest serving with either sifted confectioners sugar, blackberry jam or both. At Christmas I would suggest serving with glogg. Sift flour with sugar and salt. Mix yeast with lukewarm cream (or milk). Add eggs (one at a time). Combine all of the previous. Leave for approximately 2 hours to raise. Bake in Aebleskiver pan to golden brown at low heat. NOTES : 10 grams of baking powder could be added, then the cream should not be heated and the Aebleskiver should be baked at once. A little apple sauce or pieces of apple could be added while baking. U920424@DAIMI.AAU.DK (MADS H|JBJERG TOFTUM) REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>2 fresh broccoli (each about 3-in. bottom diameter) 1/2 lb butter 2 to 6 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tb Chervil (fresh/dried chopped) 1 ts salt 1 ts white pepper 3 c milk (full-cream milk) 1 md egg yolk, beaten 1/4 c flour 1/8 ts cardamom 1/8 ts mace 1 c heavy cream (whipping) 1/3 c Gruyere cheese (fresh, grate fine) 1/3 c parmesan cheese (grate to powder) (1) Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces. Discard the hard stem pieces, but keep tender leaves and stem parts. (2) Steam the cut broccoli for about 5-8 minutes, until just bright green in color. Do not over- cook. (3) In a 10-inch enameled (non-metal) skillet, heat 6 oz of butter until melted. Add chopped garlic and wait until butter is hot enough to cook in. Add steamed broccoli, then chervil to the skillet. Lightly salt the broccoli. (4) Cover, and cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for another 5-10 minutes or until the broccoli turns a darker green color and becomes very soft. (5) Mash the broccoli right in the skillet until no large pieces remain. Use a potato masher or a strong wooden spoon. Mash until there are no pieces remaining that are too big to fit in a soup spoon. (6) While broccoli is cooking, add beaten egg yolk to 2 cups of milk. (7) Put 3 Tbsp butter into a 2-3 quart saucepan. Use enamel or glass for best soup flavor. Metal pans will make this soup bitter. Melt butter and add flour. When the flour bubbles and starts to cook, add the egg/milk mixture into the saucepan. Add the cardamom, mace, and white pepper. Stir con- tents of saucepan constantly with wooden spoon until thick. Lower the cooking heat. (8) Empty the mashed broccoli mixture into the sau- cepan. Stir until well-mixed. Slowly stir in the remaining milk and the cream. As soon as the soup becomes hot enough to cook again, add the grated cheeses. (9) Turn the heat down lower and simmer for about 5 more minutes, stirring to allow the cheeses to melt and mix while the table is being set. Serve immediately and retire quickly so as not to be trampled by those who smelled it cooking. NOTES This recipe may be doubled, halved or whatever without penalty. Vary the amount of milk added the second time to change the soup thickness to your own tastes. You also may use any fresh green vegetable as a substitute for the broc- coli. Asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, and corn are espe- cially nice. Cook them in the same way as you did the broc- coli. Use any leftover butter on the hard French finger rolls.

      <li>Betty Bernard. "These cookies can be frozen or stored in the pantry. They are not fragile and withstand the rigors of shipping." Submitted by Suzy-Q Lewis In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, beat together shortening and brown sugar. Add egg and contnue beating until ingredients are well blended. Sift together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add flour mixture to shortening mixture, stirring to keep batter well blended. Add walnuts, chocolate morsels, coconut, raisins and bananas; mix well. Gradually stir in oats, mixing well. Drop dough from end of teaspoon onto lightly greased baking sheets. Bake in a preheated 375 deg oven 12 minutes or until done. TIP: To save time spent baking, drop batter on cookie sheet lined with heavy-duty aluminum fo8il. When done and slightly cooled, cookies will "peel" off the foil. Liner can be used again, or having two or three foil liners ready with cookie batches for baking will hasten the baking time considerably.

    <title>Adobo De Chile Ancho</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 large Garlic Cloves; Unpeeled</li>
      <li>8 medium Ancho Chilies; Dried</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Mexican Oregano; Dried</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Black Pepper; Freshly Ground</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cloves; Scant - Ground</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Broth</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Cumin Seed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. THE GARLIC AND CHILES. Set a heavy ungreased skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast to a sweet mellowness, turning occasionally, until soft when pressed between your fingers (you'll notice it has blackened in a few small spots), about 15 minutes. Cool, then slip off the papery skins and roughly chop. While the garlic is roasting, break the stems off the chiles, tear the chiles open and remove the seeds. Next, toast the chiles a few at a time on our medium-hot skillet or griddle; Open them flat, lay them on the hot surface skin-side up, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (if the temperature is right you'll hear a faint crackle), then flip them. (If pressed long enough, thy'll have changed to a mottled tan underneath. If you see a slight wisp of smoke, that's okay, but any more will mean burnt chiles.) Now, press down again to toast the other side. Transfer to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the water and discard. 2. THE SEASONING. If using whole spices, pulverize the oregano, pepper, cumin and cloves in a spice grinder or mortar then transfer to a food processor or blender, along with the drained chiles and garlic. Measure in the broth and process to a smooth puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds. (If you're using a blender and the mixture won't move through the blades, add more broth, a little at a time, unitl everything is moving, but still as thick as possible.) With a rubber spatula, work the puree through a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl; discard the skins and seeds that remain behind in the strainer. Tast (it'll ahve a rough, raw edge to it), then season with salt. ADVANCE PREPARATION - Covered and refrigerated, the marinade will keep for about 2 weeks; it also freezes well OTHER CHILES YOU CAN USE - Though I want you to learn the unique flavor of ancho by making this seasoning solo, it's very commonly made with half ancho (for rich sweetness) and half guajillo (for tangy brightness); a few chipoltes in the mix adds heat and complexity. Always substitue an equivalent weight of chiles. TRADITIONAL DISHES THAT USE THIS ESSENTIAL AS A STARTING POINT - Spice Chile-Baked Oysters, Street-Style Red Chile Enchiladas, Simple Red Mole Enchiladas, Chile-Glazed Sweet Potatoes, Red Chile Rice, Red Chile-Braised Chicken, Ancho-Marinated Whole Roast Fish. Suggested Wine: T NOTES : If you take a few minutes to make this medium-spicy seasoning paste from toasted, rehydrated ancho chiles, ssweet roasted garlic and spices, you'll have a gold mine in the refrigerator. More versatile than salsas (which are spooned on as condiments), this deep burgundy, almost fluffy puree can be turned into the most complex dishes in the Mexican collection, from slow-simmered, rich, red mole and quick-seard red-chile enchiladas to garnet-colored rice. I even use it to flavor American style baked beans . Start withthis seasoning to learn how to clean, toast, soak, puree and strain dried chiles - it'll seem awkward if you haven't done it before, but when you taste what the seasoning does to different dishes, you'll keep making it until the process seems second nature Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #914 by "Karrie Brothers" &lt;K_Brothers@classic.msn.com&gt; on Nov 18, 97</li>

      <li>This is a recipe I found on Mimi's Cyberkitchen page. I made it for Christmas dinner on Thursday. It is really, really good -- it also tastes just as good the next day (if there's any left). The only change I made was to use slivers of red onion because I didn't have any scallions. The feta cheese is essential, I think. 1.Mix all the ingredients for the vinaigrette and reserve. 2.Combine all the ingredients for the salad. 3.Add the vinaigrette and mix thoroughly. The vinaigrette can be added well in advance of serving. Yield: 6 servings Posted to FOODWINE Digest by Lyn Belisle &lt;belisle@TENET.EDU&gt; on Dec 27, 1997</li>

      <li>Beat yolks of eggs with buttermilk. Mix together sugar, salt, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cardamom. Beat egg whites until stiff. Mix egg yolk-buttermilk mixture with dry ingredients. Add egg whites, carefully folding them in so that they don't break down. Heat aebleskive pan. Put 1 tsp salad oil in each hole and fill completely with batter. Let bake until slightly crusty on bottom. Turn slightly with a knitting needle or skewer. Continue cooking, turning the ball to keep it from burning, until the knitting needle comes out clean when stuck in the center. Serve aebleskive hot with powdered sugar, jam, and jelly. Notes included with recipe: For those of you who are unfamiliar with aebleskive, it is a baked delight made with a pancake-like batter, cooked in a special pan that turns the aebleskive into a crusty ball, and is known as the "Danish Doughnut." As you can tell, it is a little difficult to give aebleskive an easy definition other than to tell you that it is good enough to go ahead and order the pans if you are likely to serve breakfasts and brunches to family and friends. Aebleskive pans are available through most gourmet cookware shops or can be ordered from Pea Soup Andersen's Santa Ynez Valley Wine Center, (805)-688-5581.

      <li>2 large Whole chicken breasts, about 2 pounds</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and adds deep flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that's as delicious as it is nutritionally correct. Serve with soft pita or Arab flatbread and fresh yogurt. Put the salt in a wide, shallow non-reactive bowl with the garlic and mash them together until you have paste. Add yogurt, lemon and pepper. Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the halves. Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie flat. Add to the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated. Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it. To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin film. Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes a side, or until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but should not char. Serve at once. From the San Francisco Examiner, 6/2/93. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and add the garlic. Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chiles along with the oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tb water. With a long series of blender pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the blender for a few seconds until the mixture clogs, then scrape down the sides with a spatula and stir; repeat a dozen times or more until the mixture is smooth. Don't add water unless absolutely necessary or this marinating paste won't do its job well. Strain the paste through a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive container with a tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate. Considerations: After soaking the chiles, they can be put through a foley food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree along with the garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this is done, and the mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and pulsed, scraped down, and mixed very well the final sieving can be eliminated. All of the chiles can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2 ounces of California or New Mexican chiles for the above chiles but the flavor will be light. Adobo with powdered chiles: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chiles and garlic as directed above, then pulverize the chiles with the cinnamon,cloves,pepper, bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a spice grinder; sift through a medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with the powdered chile mixture, oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 6 Tb water. Store as directed above.</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Source: FOODday, July 9, '91 From: Valerie Whittle This spicy marinade owes its unusual flavor to the chipotle, a smoked jalapeno chile. Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste. Look for them at Mexican and Latin American markets. Adobo marinade goes particularly well with pork. Juice the oranges and lime. Finely chop chilies and garlic. Place citrus juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar and salt in blender and puree until smooth. Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 large Cloves of garlic (up to 5)</li>
      <li>2 medium Sized onions</li>
      <li>6 medium Sized tomatoes (enough for 6 cups of good, sloppy mash) (up to 7)</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Salt or to taste</li>
      <li>10 (or so) dried chipotles (up to 12)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's a recipe for adobo sauce that I use when my smoked &amp; dried Jalapenos are crying for attention. I've adapted it from Mark Miller's recipe in The Great Chile Book. With the mass quantities of green tomatoes ripening in boxes in the basement, I've substituted them for ketchup. Seems like a good change. The chipotles are sort of my adaptation. If anybody has any other ways of making them, I'm all ears. I take the fresh Jalapeno chiles - generally the ones that have ripened to red and smoke them in my old charcoal grill with some Mesquite wood chips that have been soaked in water for a couple of days. I put them in a makeshift wire basket that I put on top of about 4 or 5 charcoal briquettes (don't want things to get too hot). On the grate above, I load up with chiles, with the exception of the area right over the fire. I let these smoke as long as my patience holds out (maybe 4-5 hours), occasionally turning the chiles and tossing a little water on the glowing wood (want it to keep the works smoking). When the chiles seem soft &amp; kind of cooked, I put them in a dehydrator to finish the job. They're then stashed in a big jar, etc. until I'm ready to use them. The sauce isn't too complicated to put together..... Peel and cut the onions into half inch slices. Peel and slice the garlic. Toast the oregano and cumin, but the cumin needs your almost undivided attention. It will burn in a heartbeat. I usually wait until it just starts to smoke. I think I've burnt more cumin than I've toasted! All this stuff goes into a 3 quart saucepan (or larger). Cut the tomatoes into quarters and grate them on a regular cheese grater down to the skin. Discard the skins. Do enough tomatoes to make 6 cups - a little more is OK, I'm sure. The mash should be fairly watery - add some water now if you think it needs it (some store tomatoes are sort of dry and pulpy). Put the vinegar, the salt and the tomatoes into the saucepan. Slowly simmer this mixture for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Somewhere in the middle of this stewing process, put in the chipotles to rehydrate. By the end, they should be nice and plump, with their smoky flavor well mixed with the sauce. The sauce should want to coat a wooden spoon. After everything cools down a bit, fish out the chipotles, leaving in a few to spice the sauce to taste. Puree the mix well. I find that the sauce seems thicker when it's pureed, so that now a metal spoon is coated when dipped (that happens often, now!). At this point, you can decide whether to strain out the seeds, etc. or not. I go back and forth about this, but usually don't. Anyway, put whatever you decide on into a container with the rest of the hydrated chiles. Whenever you want a chipotle, you know where it is and the sauce keeps for a good long time in the fridge. I use it whenever a good hot smoky flavor seems to fit - steak or chicken sauce, as an ingredient in another salsa,...........

    <title>Adobo De Achiote</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Achiote Seeds</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Allspice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Mexican Oregano</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Cider Vinegar</li>
      <li>6 Garlic Clove; Peeled</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>THE SPICE GRINDER METHOD: In a spice grinder, pulverize the achiote as finely as possible, then dump it into a small bowl. Pulverize the allspice and black pepper (if you're using whole) along with the oregano, and add to the achiote. Sprinkle in the cider vinegar and mix thoroughly (it'll be a damp powder at this point and won't hold together). Roughly chop the garlic, sprinkle it with salt, then, right back to your cutting board, use the back of a spoon or the side of a knife to work it back and forth into a paste. Little by little, work in the spice mixtire (it probably still won't hold together). Last, work in a tablespoon or two of water, if it's needed to give the mixture the consistency of a thick paste. THE MINICHOPPER METHOD: Pulverize the achiote, allspice, peppercorns and oregano together with the sharp blade. Add the vinegar to the spices, along with the garlic and salt. Pulse until the garlic is roughly chopped, then let the machine run until everything is as smooth as possible. Dribble in a tablespoon or two of water, if its necessary to bring everything together into a thick, pasty consistency. ADVANCE PREPARATION: This seasoning will last for several months in the refrigerator, if tightly coverd (I suggest a small jar).

More than a pinch of fresh achiote gives any dish an exotic. earthy perfume that to me is as captivating as good, musky saffron; it's certainly less expensive. You'll know you've got fresh achiote when the little chalky-feeling seeds have a punchy aroma and a vibrant rusty color that's more red than orange. Though in Oaxaca they make "pure" achiote past (it has only a little salt, sugar and acid added), it is the Yucatecan garlic-flavored, spice-riddled achiote past that most Mexicans use. Even in the States Yucatecan achiote past is available in most Mexican groceries. Homemade achiote paste has the brightest, most concentrated flavors (some of the commercial brans contain fillers), and it's really very simple. Smeared over fish before it's grilled, slathered on pork before it's braised or roasted, stirred in tamal dough before it's steamed -- achiote reveals the genius of Mexican cooks. Not spicy-hot here, but spicy-complex without chile. My version nods more in that direction than some I've encountered. Silvio Campos, a Yucatecan who came to Frontera Grill to make his famous pork pibil, made his with double the achiote of mine and half the spices. Try that version for an even more true-to-achiote flavor. NOTES : Achiote is the saffron of Mexico; If it's not fresh or if it's used in tiny pinches, the orangey color is all you notice.

    <ingredient>
      <li>7 ounces Light brown sugar</li>
      <li>9 tablespoons Cocoa powder</li>
      <li>10 ounces Butter or margarine; softened</li>
      <li>pinches Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 pound Plain flour (approximately)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400F. Mix all of the ingredients together, except for the flour. Add the flour slowly to the rest of the mixture until it reaches the right consistency to roll out. The dough should be quite soft. (You may find it easier to knead it with your hands.) Roll out on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch and cut into decorative shapes with small cookie cutters, a sharp knife or the rim of a glass. Place on a greased baking sheet and bake in the oven for about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven while they are still soft and cool on a rack, then pack into crocks or jars. The authors note that the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers made these at Thanksgiving and stored them in a stoneware crock until Christmas. The cookies can be made at any time, but allowed to age for 4-6 weeks. They can be used as a substitute for graham crackers for a pie crust. from Edible Gifts by Claire Clifton and Martina Nicolls typed by Tiffany Hall-Graham From: Tiffany Hall-Graham Date: 05 Mar 95 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #258 Date: Fri, 20 Sep 1996 18:29:37 -0500 From: netdir@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell)</li>

      <li>1/2 Level teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>275 grams Sugar</li>
      <li>4 deciliters Cognac</li>
      <li>1 1/2 level teaspoons vanilla essence (extract, I think)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Separate the eggs and beat the yolks with the salt and the sugar, until the mixture is thick and creamy. Beat in the cognac, very slowly and put the mixture into a double saucepan. Heat gently, whisking all the time until the advocaat is warm (not hot) and thick. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla essence. Pour into a jug. Advocaat is served in a glass and eaten with a teaspoon. It can also be topped with whipped cream. Also, might I add, that advocaat is nothing like the eggnog here in America...it is thick and creamy---not foamy at all. Boy, is Advocaat delicious! (I usually get a bottle of it from the Dutch-America store and skip the above...:) This delicious Dutch drink is actually eaten with a spoon!

    <title>Aebleskiver (Danish Pancake Balls)</title>
    <category>Bread</category>
    <quantity>14</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Eggs; separated</li>
      <li>2/3 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Freshly grated lemon peel</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Butter; melted</li>
      <li>Confectioner's sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>An iron pan with circular indentations is used to make the meltingly light Danish pancake balls called aebleskiver. There is no real substitute for aebleskiver pans; fortunately they are available in fancy cookware shops or in Scandinavian import stores throught the country. The authentic way to turn the aebleskiver in the pan is with a knitting needle. (I remember my grandmother telling me this too!) I always thought she was making it up. Beat the egg whites until stiff. With the same beater, beat the egg holks until frothy. Combine the flour, sugar and salt and sift into the egg yolks in three stages, adding the cream alternately. Add the lemon peel, then stir in the melted butter. Stir a little of the egg whites into the mixture to lighten it, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Meanwhile, heat an aebleskiver pan. When the pan is hot, grease each indentation with butter. Spoon in the batter, filling the indentations 3/4 full. Cook until the lower half of each aebleskiver is golden brown but the upper half is still uncooked. With a pointed object such as a knitting needle, nut pick or skewer and using a knife or spoon for balance, tip each aebleskiver and turn it over in the indentation. The uncooked batter will flow out to fit the indentation, making the aebleskiver round. Cook until the other half is golden brown. Serve immediately with butter, confectioners' sugar and or tart jelly. Makes 14 aebleskiver. Taken from Good Bread/Hansen 1976.

      <li>submitted by: edmon@cc.xu.edu.ph I was requested to submit this recipe here. This is a very common Filipino dish and very practical for tropical countries because of the lack of electricity and appliances in villages and it can keep for days without refrigeration. This dish however has become one of the Philippine favorites even in cities and towns. Combine all ingredients in a caserole and bring to a boil. Bring heat to medium and simmer until meat is very tender. Some would transfer the dish to a wok and fry the dish in its own oil until the pork and chicken are shredded. Serve with rice. Most families do this purely with pork. For variation it is also good to include chicken slices. This they call Chicken-Pork Adobo. ED MONTALVAN, P.O.

    <title>Acrobat Chocolate Polenta Cake</title>
    <category>Cakes</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>12 ounces Semi-sweet chocolate</li>
      <li>3/4 pounds Sweet butter</li>
      <li>8 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups White sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Ground almonds</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Cornmeal</li>
      <li>8 Egg whites</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cream of tartar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large saucepan over very low heat, melt chocolate. Add butter, stir until melted and remove from heat (the mixture should be body temperature, not too hot to touch with a finger). In a large bowl, combine egg yolks, brown and white sugar, and stir until well mixed. Add the chocolate, and stir well until combined. In a small bowl, combine almonds, flour and cornmeal, stir until well mixed. Pour this into the chocolate and stir until combined. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with cream of tartar until they form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the chocolate in three batches. Chef Dale Nichols warns that folding egg whites into chocolate takes a real knack and suggests using your hand as the paddle. To do this by hand, use your hand as a paddle and push your palm down to the centre of the bowl, and slide up the side of the bowl and turn your hand over. Do not over-mix or you will knock the air out of the egg whites causing a much denser texture. Bake in a buttered, floured 10 inch spring form pan for 5 minutes at 400F. Reduce heat to 350F and bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until cake tests done in the centre. Let cool completely before removing from pan.

Bring to boiling over medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, simmer, uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Tootie's notes: 2 things you need to know, if you use tomatoes with salt added, leave out the salt, it is tooooo much salt for us. You either love or hate this stew. So, you may want to try this before you serve it for guest. We love it with tomato corn bread, sour cream dolloped on top and cheese fried sticks.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Mixture of dhals*</li>
      <li>2 cups Long grained rice</li>
      <li>Salt to taste.</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*(use any combination of tur dhal, chana dal or even split yellow peas) Wash and rinse the dhals and rice thoroughly. When the rinse water runs clear, soak the dhals and rice together in a bowl with fresh water for a couple of hours. Drain the dhal-rice mixture and grind into a somewhat coarse mixture in a blender using water when necessary. Empty the batter into a bowl, add some salt and let it rest for at least an hour. You could also let it ferment overnight if you like a sourdough tang in your pancakes. To make the pancakes, heat a non-stick/well-seasoned cast iron skillet on a moderate stove. If a few drops of water bounce off the pan, the pan is hot enough and you can proceed to make the pancakes. Drop a ladleful of the pre-prepared batter in the center of the pan and with the back of the ladle, swirl the batter from inside to outside to form a thin round pancake. Wait till the top looks dry, wait another minute if you like them crisp and flip to cook the other side. Remove onto a plate and eat immediately with a nice coriander chutney. (Continue preparing pancakes in the same way, till you run out of batter and/or chutney. The batter will also keep in the fridge for almost a week and you can prepare the pancakes when the mood strikes you.) Variation: Can add finely chopped onions/jalapenos/spinach/ginger/a few cumin seeds, anything you fancy, to the batter before making the pancakes. You will however not be able to make neat circular pancakes. Instead, you will end up with (tasty) irregular shaped ones. From: nalini@picard.vwo.Verdix.COM (Nalini Ganapati).

    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large bowl, soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. Mix the salt, 2 tablespoons of the shortening, and the cold water together and add to the yeast mixture. Sift in the flour gradually, beating well after each addition for a smooth consistency. You will probably have to knead in the final cup of flour. Shape the dough into a ball, brish lightly with the remaining shortening, and cover with a dry cloth. Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in bulk, anout 1 hour. Punch the dough down and, on a floured board, knead about 5 minutes. Shape into 2 round loaves on a well greased baking sheet. Cover with a dry cloth and set to rise another 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the loaves on a cookie sheet 50 minutes, until they are light brown and sound hollow when tapped. ***** This is an adaptation of the traditional recipe that is still being used by almost every Native American family.

Add rum and brandy. Beat the egg-whites until stiff and stir carefully into the dough. Fill the dough into a round baking-form covered with baking-paper (paper that prevents sticking). Bake it in a preheated oven for about 60 minutes at 175C Let it cool down (or out?). Whip cream until stiff and put onto the cooled cake. Pour egg liquer over it.

      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Finely grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put a large pot of water on to boil. Snap off and discard the tough asparagus ends, and cut the stalks into 1-inch pieces. You will have about 3 cups of asparagus. Steam until barely tender, 6 to 8 minutes, and set aside. Begin cooking the ravioli, stirring occasionally. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute' the red pepper, mushrooms, and garlic until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, and let it cook for a minute or two. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly until thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the salt, paprika, mustard, basil, Romano cheese, and pepper to taste stirring until the cheese is melted. Reduce the heat to very low, and stir in the sauteed vegetables. When the ravioli is tender and begins to float , after about 10 to 12 minutes, drain it well, and transfer it to a large serving bowl. Pour on the sauce, and toss gently. Garnish with paprika, and serve with Parmesan on the side. Tender ravioli, asparagus, and mushrooms tossed with a Dijon and basil cheese sauce make for this elegant entree, named for Italy's beautiful Adriatic coast. 4 servings Ginny Callan, Beyond The Moon Cookbook, more vegetarian recipes from the author of Horn of the Moon cookbook Adapted for Mastercook software by Brenda Adams &lt;adamsfmle@sprintmail.com&gt; Recipe By : Ginny Callan, Beyond the Moon Cookbook Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #259 Date: Fri, 25 Oct 1996 23:38:25 -0700 From: Brenda Adams &lt;adamsfmle@sprintmail.com&gt;</li>

      <li>REDUCE CHOLESTEROL ~ Use vegetable oil or margarine instead of butter ~ Substitute 2 egg whites for 1 egg, or use egg substitute ~ Use more vegetables and grains and less meat in recipe ~ Use soy-based product to replace part of meat eg. tofu ~ Use nonfat milk products instead of whole milk REDUCE FAT CONTENT ~ Use reduced calorie mayonnaise and salad dressing ~ Blend cottage cheese or yogurt with milk for sour cream topping ~ Replace regular whipping cream with low-cal topping or yogurt ~ Remove visible fat from meat and skin from poultry before cooking ~ Decrease oil in marinades and salad dressing; increase vinegar, water and seasonings ~ Use foods canned in their own juice or water ~ De-fat meat drippings by refrigerating and skimming fat off the top ~ Decrease the amount of fat used in baked goods by 1/3 to 1/2 and increase fluids called for to reach desired consistency. ~ Cheese that is finely grated or thinly sliced goes further ~ Pour some of the fat off the top of "natural" peanut butters REDUCE SODIUM CONTENT ~ Use low-salt or no-salt-added products ~ Increase your use of herbs and spices in place of salt in recipes ~ Use fresh foods whenever possible in place of canned or processed (soup mixes, cured meats etc) or rinse canned foods (tuna) with water ~ Do not add salt to water when cooking pasta or other foods REDUCE SUGAR CONTENT ~ Decrease the amount of sugar called for in traditional recipes by at least 1/3; substitute fruit juices, nectars or pureed fruits. ~ Use fruit canned in water or fruit juice ~ Use non caloric sweeteners if needed to increase the sweetness of a recipe without added calories.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 kilograms Small fresh squids</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Native vinegar</li>
      <li>10 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Got down my single Filipino cook book and found this little gem. My grasp of Tagalog is non-existent but I'd guess that the name translates as "Squid Adobo". At any rate, it's squid stewed in vinegar. I assume that the reference to "native vinegar" refers to nipa sap vinegar (sukang paombong). The bottle I have is a milky looking vinegar that tastes pretty much like any vinegar so I imagine that you have some latitude on what type you can use. For those of you who have never tried it, Filipino food is an intriguing cuisine that has elements of Southeast Asian, Chinese and Mexican or Spanish influences. It has everything from spring rolls (lumpias) to rellenos dishes. Wash the squids very well. Remove the long thin membrane in the head and slit the eyes to bring out the ink. Place the squids in a saucepan with vinegar, 6 cloves garlic crushed, salt and pepper. Cover and cook slowly until the squids are tender. Cut cooked squids into 1/2 inch slices crosswise. Crush remaining garlic and saute in a little lard in another pan. Add the onion and tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are very soft. Add the squids and the liquid in which they were boiled. Simmer for 7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and vet-sin. From "Favorite Filipino Recipes" by Pat Limjuco Dayrit. Paul Hamlyn Pty Limited. Dee Why West, New South Wales. 1975.

Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste. Look for them at Mexican and Latin American markets. Adobo marinade goes particularly well with pork. Juice the oranges and lime. Finely chop chilies and garlic. Place citrus juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar and salt in blender and puree until smooth. Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken. MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MealMaster recipe list.

      <li>1/4 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Cardamom</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Mace</li>
      <li>1 cup Heavy cream; (whipping)</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Gruyere cheese; (fresh, grate fine)</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Parmesan cheese; (grate to powder)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(1) Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces. Discard the hard stem pieces, but : keep tender leaves and stem parts. (2) Steam the cut broccoli for about 5-8 minutes, until just bright green : in color. Do not over- cook. (3) In a 10-inch enameled (non-metal) skillet, heat 6 oz of butter until : melted. Add chopped garlic and wait until butter is hot enough to : cook in. Add steamed broccoli, then chervil to the skillet. Lightly : salt the broccoli. (4) Cover, and cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally with a : wooden spoon, for another 5-10 minutes or until the broccoli turns a : darker green color and becomes very soft. (5) Mash the broccoli right in the skillet until no large pieces remain. : Use a potato masher or a strong wooden spoon. Mash until there are no : pieces remaining that are too big to fit in a soup spoon. (6) While broccoli is cooking, add beaten egg yolk to 2 cups of milk. (7) Put 3 Tbsp butter into a 2-3 quart saucepan. Use enamel or glass for : best soup flavor. Metal pans will make this soup bitter. Melt butter : and add flour. When the flour bubbles and starts to cook, add the : egg/milk mixture into the saucepan. Add the cardamom, mace, and white : pepper. Stir con- tents of saucepan constantly with wooden spoon : until thick. Lower the cooking heat. (8) Empty the mashed broccoli mixture into the sau- cepan. Stir until : well-mixed. Slowly stir in the remaining milk and the cream. As soon : as the soup becomes hot enough to cook again, add the grated cheeses. (9) Turn the heat down lower and simmer for about 5 more minutes, stirring : to allow the cheeses to melt and mix while the table is being set. : Serve immediately and retire quickly so as not to be trampled by those : who smelled it cooking. NOTES This recipe may be doubled, halved or whatever without penalty. Vary : the amount of milk added the second time to change the soup thickness : to your own tastes. You also may use any fresh green vegetable as a : substitute for the broccoli. Asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, and corn are especially nice. Cook them in the same way as you did the broccoli. Use any leftover butter on the hard French finger rolls. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V5 #009 by "John Weber" &lt;hdbrer@ibm.net&gt; on Jan 08, 98</li>

Transfer to a saucepan, bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring once or twice to prevent scorching, and cover the pan. Reduce heat to a low and simmer for 10 minutes, The sauce is done when the raw tomato and red chili taste are gone. Once cooled, it will be about as thick as ketchup, suitable to use as a thick meat marinade or to moisten fillings that need to remain fairly stiff, such as tamales. FOR ENCHILADA SAUCE. Dilute with 3/4 to 1 cup water and adjust salt as needed. This amount will sauce enchiladas for 4 people. MC-Recipe Digest V1 #135 From the MasterCook recipe list.

      <li>Around the Arabian Gulf, highly spiced food is still common: recipes from the region call for complex spice blends, often with chilies. Enthusiasm for rich spicing passes to North Africa, to Ethiopia and the countries of the Magreb (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), where food is spiced with pepper, cubebs, cumin, caraway, cinnamon and cassia, ginger and saffron. Chilies and mild peppers are common too, but not all the food is ferociously hot; many Moroccan dishes are quite delicate and subtle in their flavoring. Further south, in both East and West Africa, chilies are the dominant flavoring. Elsewhere in the Middle East, subtle spicing prevails in the Arab countries, Iran and Turkey.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix rice, chana dal, urad dal, and yellow split peas in a large vessel. Soak in a lot of water for about 2 hours. Grind the soaked mixture with chili powder and salt coarsely, without adding much water. Ferment for about 3 - 4 hours, then refrigerate or freeze. In cold weather, the fermenting process might take longer, and it might be a good idea to ferment in an oven (the pilot light will keep the mixture warm). Add either onions (finely cut), carrot (grated) or coconut before preparing. Freezing Notes If freezing, only ferment for about an hour. The mixture will have to be left out for a while before being ready to use.

      <li>Date: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 20:10:39 -0600 From: Jim Avery &lt;javery@airmail.net&gt; Subject: Ribs - actually, *these* ribs are the best in the universe... OK, y'all, we've heard the hype, now comes the *real* thing...;&gt; Get you some: Baby back ribs (yes, the pork kind), brush them lightly with some Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce on both sides, so that you can tell that there's some on 'em. Broil them (in the oven) on both sides so that they are nice and brown (don't COOK 'em, just give 'em some color), and place them in a covered roaster pan in a 250F oven for about 2 hours. Drain the liquid from the pan and save it for something else. You can use some of the meat juice in the Ranch Sauce (recipe follows), or you can throw it away. Paint the ribs with Ranch Sauce on both sides and put back in the roaster in the over for about another hour or so. Before serving, grill them over moderate coals to brown and finish, basting them again with Ranch Sauce, about 10 - 15 minutes. Ranch Sauce: this recipe is from Frito - Lay, circa 1957. Hard to beat: Mix all ingredients in a non-reactive saucepan, bring to a boil and simmer for at least 20 minutes, stirring often so that it doesn't stick. This, my friends, is fit to eat!

Typos by Brenda Adams &lt;adamsfmle@aol.com&gt; Source: "The Well-Filled Microwave Cookbook" by Victoria Wise and Susanna Hoffman Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #208 Date: Tue, 20 Aug 1996 01:03:55 -0400 From: ADAMSFMLE@aol.com NOTES : Looking like. a small, leafy nosegay with pearly, lettuce-like branches spreading from a core,baby bok choy is a cabbage. Until recently it was known only to Chinese grocers and cooks, but its appeal has spread, and many supermarkets now carry the vegetable. It has two great advantages: It steams whole to beautifully decorate a party plate and in the microwave, it speeds to such a rapid crunchy doneness, you scarcely turn around and it's ready. It can be simply wilted and buttered, oiled, sauced with soy, or included in a stir-fry.</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>There are quite a few pork dishes in the book (including another version of this one). Evidently minorities are well enough represented that pork has earned a place in the cuisine of predominantly Muslim Indonesia. I think this would be excellent done with 1 inch long pieces of baby back ribs. I also won't stew it as long as I did++or maybe use bigger chunks of pork. I used pieces between a half and a quarter inch on a side and the meat got a tad dried out. No complaint on the taste though! I'll also toss in a couple of scallions cut into one inch chunks just before it's done stewing. I was out of sambal oelek so I used some tuong ot toi cut with a little lime juice. Worked good. Dice Pork, rub in salt and pepper and fry in hot oil or margarine. Then add the finely sliced onions, spices and the hot pepper condiment. After this add the water and the soy sauce. Bring to the boil and simmer for at least half an hour until the meat is done. Serve Babi Ketjap on a large plate, garnish with sliced tomatoes and chopped vegetable pickles. Eat with plain or savory rice or Mei. From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London, 1986." For those who aren't familiar with it, Kecap Manis (or ketjap manis) is a thick, sweet Indonesian soy sauce that does wonderful things for meat and poultry as a marinade/BBQ sauce as well as a condiment.

Add the milk and all remaining ingred. for the baba in the order SUGGESTED by YOUR bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions. 3. Make a syrup by boiling the sugar &amp; water together in a small saucepan until the mixture is clear. Add the rum and simmer for 1 minute. 4.

    <title>Baba Ghanoush (Aubergines with Tahina)</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 large Aubergines</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic, or to taste (up to 4)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 pints Tahina paste or less, depending on the size of the aubergines</li>
      <li>3 Lemons, or more to taste, juice of</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cumin (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Finely chopped parsley</li>
      <li>A few black olives -or-</li>
      <li>1 Tomato, thinly sliced, to garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>&gt;From Middle Eastern Food by Claudia Roden This rich cream is a combination of 2 strong flavours: the smoky one of aubergines prepared as below, and the strong taste of tahina sharpened by lemon and garlic. It is exciting and vulgarly seductive. The ingredients are added almost entirely to taste, the harmony of flavours depending largely on the size and flavour the aubergines used. The quantities below give a fairly large amount, enough to be served as a dip at a party. Cook the aubergines over charcoal or under a gas flame or electricgrill until the skin blackens and blisters. Peel and wash the aubergines, and squeeze out as much of the bitter juice as possible. Crush the garlic cloves with salt. Mash the aubergines with a potato masher or a fork, then add the crushed garlic and little more salt, and pound to a smooth, creamy puree. Add the tahina paste and lemon juice alternately, beating well or blending for a few seconds between each addition. Taste and add more salt, lemon juice, garlic or tahina if you think it is necessary, and if you like, a little cumin. Pour the cream into a bowl or a few smaller serving dishes. Garnish with finely chopped parsley and black olives, oe with Arab or other bread (pita), as a salad, or as a party dip.

    <category>Meat</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Black pepper</li>
      <li>1 dash Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Garlic powder</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix together ingredients. Remove the membrane from the underside of the ribs. Sprinkle ribs with spices--make more if you have to--and let marinade for as long as you want. Use a barbecue grill with the coals on the sides (a dome shape grill works well). Stand up the ribs in a rib rack (available at most hardware stores, but I've also made them out of coat hangers) in the center of the grill. The convection effect of the coals on the side will cook the ribs very well. Keep the temperature as low as possible (about 200 F if you can) and feed the coals every half hour. Once they're done (about 1 1/2 hr-&gt; 2 hrs) you can put barbecue sauce on them, although the purist always serves the sauce on the side. PS: make sure you don't put the ribs directly over the coals--the fat from them will cause a fire and burn the ribs.

    <quantity>14</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2/3 cups Butter or margarine --</li>
      <li>Softened</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 cups Cake flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Milk</li>
      <li>Slightly sweetened whipped</li>
      <li>Cream</li>
      <li>Fresh fruit, such as berries</li>
      <li>Or kiwi</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Wash and dry 14 tin cans, 14 to 16 ounces each, or 14 small (1-cup) souffle dishes; grease and flour insides. 2. In large bowl of electric mixer, beat butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until fluffy. Beat 5 minutes on high speed, scraping bowl occasionally. 3. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. 4. Add dry ingredients to batter alternately with milk. 5. Spoon about 1/3 cup of batter into each prepared tin can. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. (The tops will not brown.) 6. Remove to a wire rack and cool completely, until the edges become dry and crusty. Run a knife around the inside of cans or dishes to loosen edges, tap on a counter, then turn cakes out; they should slide out easily. 7. With a serrated knife, cut off and discard the rounded tops of cakes. Turn cakes upside down so cut edges are on the bottom. Cut cakes into two layers and fill with whipped cream and fresh fruit. * Timesaver Tip: Cake batter can be made ahead and frozen before baking. Complete steps 1 through 4 and spoon batter into cans. Wrap cans with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Label and date, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 6 weeks. To bake, do not thaw. Remove foil and bake at 325 degrees F until cakes test done, about 30 minutes. Complete steps 6 and 7. Recipe By : the California Culinary Academy File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

    <ingredient>

      <li>2 Garlic Cloves, peeled</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Tahini</li>
      <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to gas mark 5/375F/190C. Prick the skins of the aubergines with a carving fork and bake in the oven for one hour, or until flesh is soft. Remove and allow to cool so you can handle them without burning your hands. Cut in half and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Mash with a fork. You may prefer to use a food processor, but i like the rough finish achieved with a fork. Crush the garlic cloves with a hard blow from your hand on the back of a large sharp knife and then chop the pulp finely. Add this, along with the tahini, lemon juice and parsley, to the aubergine. Stir everything thoroughly, and add enough olive oil to give a rich thick consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with warm slices of pitta bread or hot toast.

    <title>Baby's Dirty Diapers</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 Caramel squares</li>
      <li>24 large Marshmallows</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Unwrap caramel squares and cut them in four equal parts with your kitchen scissors. Set aside. Next, snip marshmallows partway down the center, lengthwise. To create a diaper, the marshmallow needs to stay in one piece, so make sure you don't cut all the way through. Snip two triangle-shaped wedges off the marshmallow's bottom to create leg openings. Insert one piece of caramel into the cut center of each sliced marshmallow. With clean hands, pinch the sides of the marshmallow back together around the caramel piece. Gently pinch and pull the sides of the marshmallow to form your diaper. Arrange the diapers on the toaster oven tray or a square of heavy-duty foil about 2 inches apart. Toast on a "light toast" setting for about 30 seconds or until marshmallows begin to bubble. The diapers will melt and lose shape quickly, so be careful not to overcook. Remove diapers from oven and cool slightly. Dirty diapers taste best when they're fresh and warm. Makes: 24 party poopers.

      <li>3 tablespoons Unsalted butter --</li>
      <li>Clarified</li>
      <li>16 slices Homemade white bread --</li>
      <li>Crusts removed</li>
      <li>5 pounds Tart red apples, peeled,</li>
      <li>Cored -- thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>With a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 1 1/2 quart, 3 to 3 1/2 inch deep charlotte or other straight-sided mold with the tablespoon of softened butter. Pour all but 3 tablespoons of the clarified butter into a large bowl. With a sharp knife, cut three slices of the bread into 6 triangles by slicing them in half diagonally. Cut another 7 slices of bread in half. One at a time, briefly dip the bread triangles into the bowl of clarified butter and lay them side by side in the bottom of the mold. With a small, sharp knife, trim the triangles so that their points meet in the middle and no spaces show between the slices. Now dip the bread halves in the butter and stand them upright around the sides of the mold, overlapping them slightly. The bread will rise slightly above the top of the mold. Cut another 3 slices of the bread into 1 inch squares. Heat the reserved 3 tablespoons of clarified butter in a heavy 10- to 12-inch skillet set over high heat and drop in the bread squares. Turning them about constantly with a wooden spoon, cook the squares for 2 to 3 minutes, until they are lightly and evenly coloured on all sides. Remove the browned bread squares from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. In a 4 quart casserole combine the apples, sugar and water. Bring to a boil over high heat , then cover tightly, reduce the heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes, or until the apples are tender and show no resistance when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Uncover and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the apples become a thick, coarse puree. Stir in the cinnamon and refrigerate the puree until well chilled. When ready to assemble and bake the dessert, stir the browned bread squares into the apple puree and pour the mixture into the prepared mold. Do not be concerned if the filling rises above the rim of the mold; the apple puree will subside as it bakes. Preheat the oven to 375F. Cut 2 of the remaining slices of bread in half, dip them in butter and place them on top of the filling. Cut the remaining slice into narrow strips, dip them into the butter and arrange them around the top to cover the exposed areas. Bake in the center of the oven for 1 hour or until the bread is golden brown. Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature, then invert a flat serving platter on top and, grasping the plate and mold firmly together, turn them over. Let the mold rest in this fashion for another 30 minutes before gently lifting it off the cake. Either pour the apricot sauce over the top and sides of the unmolded apple charlotte, or serve it separately in a bowl.

Wrap tortilla stack in foil and heat until warmed through, 10 to 15 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, cook onion in oil over medium-high heat until softened but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeno peppers and cook until garlic is just fragrant, about 30 seconds. 3. Spread about 1-1/2 tablespoons bean mixture on each tortilla half and roll up jelly-roll fashion. Arrange on a serving plate and sprinkle with cilantro. Serve warm with sour cream and salsa. COMMENTS: If you love spicy foods, you'll find these irresistible. They're also a bit messy to eat, so be sure to provide lots of napkins.

      <li>Date: Sun, 25 Feb 1996 13:05:42 -0500 From: Kit Anderson &lt;kit@maine.com&gt; These are the worlds best ribs. I know. I was born in Memphis and have lived in Texas and South Carolina. I have tried every way there is to prepare ribs on the grill. It is dangerous muck about with this recipe. I once even tried to use spare ribs and my wife almost cried. These are perfect. There is a BBQ joint in heaven. It has one thing on the menu. This is it. One rack of baby back pork ribs per moderately hungry person marinate in cider vinegar for a few minutes liberal amounts of garlic salt liberal amounts of canned black pepper The smoker should be at 200-225F. Use a pan of water in the smoker. Mesquite, hickory, or oak chunks on natural charcoal. Briquettes are filled with petroleum and coal and will give you laboratory rats in your bladder. No amount of homebrew will flush them out either. I won't even discuss the evils of propane. Should take 2 1/2 hours. For an good afforadble smoker, look at the Brinkmann's Porfessiona' That's it? Yep. Don't change a thing. Don't use fresh ground pepper or cloves of garlic. If you need sauce( you won't ), it goes on the side. And yes, chipotles en adobo make for a great BBQ sauce.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 kilograms (1 1/4 lb) fillet of pork or leg of pork</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Clear soya sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Plain flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Powdered ginger</li>
      <li>20 grams (4 oz) button mushrooms</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 slice Of root ginger, about 2 cm (1") across and 1/2 cm (1/4") thick</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Dark soya sauce</li>
      <li>Pepper or a pinch of chilli powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Boiled water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Medium dry sherry or rice wine (optional)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Oil or pork fat</li>
      <li>This, as its name suggests, is pork cooked in soya sauce. It is a</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>particular favourite with my own husband and children, who always know when it is about to appear on the table because the ginger and garlic frying in the sauce smell so deliciously savoury. Cut the pork into small cubes. Put the flour into a bowl and add the clear soya sauce and ginger powder, mixing them well together. Coat the pork with the mixture and then let it stand for at least 30 minutes. Clean and slice the mushrooms. Peel the garlic and ginger and slice them very thin; you can use these thin slices as they are, or cut them again into very tiny sticks. Heat the oil or fat in a wok or thick frying pan and fry the meat, half of it at a time, turning it from time to time, for 5 minutes. Repeat the process for the remaining half of the meat. The flour that coated the meat will tend to stay in the pan or stick to the bottom of it, but leave it there-it will thicken the sauce later. Now take most of the oil out of the pan, leaving only about two tablespoons which you then heat again. In this, fry the tiny slices of garlic and ginger and the mushrooms, stirring continuously, for i minute. Add the soya sauce, the water and the meat. mix well, season with pepper or chilli powder, and stir continuously for 1 or 2 minutes. just before serving, add the sherry or rice wine and the lemon juice. Serve hot. This dish keeps extremely well in the freezer, and it is worth making a large quantity from, say, half a leg-of pork, which is much cheaper than buying pork fillet. If you are going to freeze your Babi Kecap, however, do not add the sherry or lemon juice at the time of cooking. To serve from the freezer, thaw the meat out completely and heat quickly on a high flame for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring or shaking the pan well all the time. Add the sherry or rice wine and lemon juice just before serving. Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London, 1986." ISBN 0-907325-29-7.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>12 Whole baby beets; tops removed</li>
      <li>2 Navel oranges; or sweet oranges</li>
      <li>1/4 small Red onion; cut in half</li>
      <li>Lengthwise and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>10 Mint leaves; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Extra-virgin olive oil; orange flavored</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the beets, unpeeled, in a foil-lined baking dish. Cover with more foil and seal the edges of the top and bottom layers of foil to completely enclose the beets. Place them in a 400 degree oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes or until the beets are tender when pierced with a sharp paring knife. While the beets are baking peel the oranges. First cut a thin slice from the top and bottom of the orange so that it can sit firmly on the countertop. Using a sharp paring knife cut the peel and pith off with sawing downward strokes so that the orange is completely peeled. Cut the individual sections out from the membranes. Place in a mixing bowl together with the onion and mint. When the beets are tender hold them under running water and slip the skins off. Trim the stem end, then cut them in half and then into slices. Add the beet slices to the bowl with the oranges. Season with salt and pepper to taste than drizzle the orange olive oil over to taste. Toss to mix. Can be served immediately or allowed to marinate up to 2 days. NOTES : Insalata di Barbabietole</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>* Sesame paste. I've heard of substituting peanut butter, but never tried it. The variable amounts of ingredients depend on your taste and on the size of the eggplant. Try it without celery and red pepper and then you can decide if you want to use it next time. Saute onions, (celery &amp; red pepper) till starting to brown (I do in a wok). Add eggplant and garlic, stir well, add spices (not the salt), stir again and on very low fire, saute. May drop some liquid, that's all right, let it evaporate, and saute slowly until everything is very tender. Keep checking, it's better if it browns a little, but needs stirring so it doesn't burn. If it's too dry, add a few TBs liquid at a time (I use vegetable broth, liquid from steaming veggies, or liquid from microwaving mushrooms, etc. but water would probably do). Add salt, tahini and lemon juice, pulse a few seconds at a time in food processor or mash with potato masher -- can be slightly lumpy, too smooth is pretty awful.Add green stuff, pulse once or twice to chop coarsely and distribute or chop coarsely and stir in. It's an ugly color, so I try to dress it up with a lemon slice, greens and black olives, seems to help. Serve with quarters of pita bread or mini pitas, it's finger food, a great appetizer with a curry meal From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 kilograms (1 1/4 lb) fillet of pork or leg of pork</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Clear soya sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Plain flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Powdered ginger</li>
      <li>20 grams (4 oz) button mushrooms</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 slice Of root ginger, about 2 cm (1") across and 1/2 cm (1/4") thick</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Dark soya sauce</li>
      <li>Pepper or a pinch of chilli powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Boiled water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Medium dry sherry or rice wine (optional)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Oil or pork fat</li>
      <li>This, as its name suggests, is pork cooked in soya sauce. It is a</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>particular favourite with my own husband and children, who always know when it is about to appear on the table because the ginger and garlic frying in the sauce smell so deliciously savoury. Cut the pork into small cubes. Put the flour into a bowl and add the clear soya sauce and ginger powder, mixing them well together. Coat the pork with the mixture and then let it stand for at least 30 minutes. Clean and slice the mushrooms. Peel the garlic and ginger and slice them very thin; you can use these thin slices as they are, or cut them again into very tiny sticks. Heat the oil or fat in a wok or thick frying pan and fry the meat, half of it at a time, turning it from time to time, for 5 minutes. Repeat the process for the remaining half of the meat. The flour that coated the meat will tend to stay in the pan or stick to the bottom of it, but leave it there-it will thicken the sauce later. Now take most of the oil out of the pan, leaving only about two tablespoons which you then heat again. In this, fry the tiny slices of garlic and ginger and the mushrooms, stirring continuously, for i minute. Add the soya sauce, the water and the meat. mix well, season with pepper or chilli powder, and stir continuously for 1 or 2 minutes. just before serving, add the sherry or rice wine and the lemon juice. Serve hot. This dish keeps extremely well in the freezer, and it is worth making a large quantity from, say, half a leg-of pork, which is much cheaper than buying pork fillet. If you are going to freeze your Babi Kecap, however, do not add the sherry or lemon juice at the time of cooking. To serve from the freezer, thaw the meat out completely and heat quickly on a high flame for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring or shaking the pan well all the time. Add the sherry or rice wine and lemon juice just before serving. Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London, 1986." ISBN 0-907325-29-7.

      <li>Preheat the oven to gas mark 5/375F/190C. Prick the skins of the aubergines with a carving fork and bake in the oven for one hour, or until flesh is soft. Remove and allow to cool so you can handle them without burning your hands. Cut in half and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Mash with a fork. You may prefer to use a food processor, but i like the rough finish achieved with a fork. Crush the garlic cloves with a hard blow from your hand on the back of a large sharp knife and then chop the pulp finely. Add this, along with the tahini, lemon juice and parsley, to the aubergine. Stir everything thoroughly, and add enough olive oil to give a rich thick consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with warm slices of pitta bread or hot toast.

      <li>3 tablespoons Tahini (sesame seed paste) (up to 5)</li>
      <li>1 large Clove garlic (or more)</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Lemon juice (2 lemons)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>

      <li>Parsley</li>
      <li>Chopped green pepper</li>
      <li>Crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>Pomegranate seeds</li>
      <li>Olive oil (this one is necessary)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut a slit in the eggplant and roast it in a 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes or until soft. (If camping you can grill it) Run under cold water and peel off skin. Mash up the eggplant and add tahini, garlic, lemon juice and salt. Spread on a plate or a shallow dish, sprinkle with red pepper and whatever other garnish you like. Pour 2 -3 Tbsp of olive oil on top to cover thinly. Serve cold or at room temp (best) with triangles of pita bread or cubes of frensh sourdough for dipping. NOTE: You can bake and add an onion for variation and/or add a peeled, finely chopped tomato. I have also used yoghurt mixed in instead of olive oil on top (althouhg this sort of makes the stuff look like someone ate it already - but it tastes good!) This is simple enought to prepare while camping or for an outdoor buffet where refrigeration may be a problem. It is best eaten immediately after being prepared.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: dianew@sdsc.edu (Diane M. Wojewocki) Date: Thu, 24 Feb 94 11:11:26 PST This recipe came from a small book simply called "Polish Cook Book" written by the children of Anna Dziengiel Pieklo and dedicated to her. I have made it and it is absolutely delicious. Having grown up in a VERY Polish family, this is the closest recipe I've found to the Babka I grew up on! TOPPING: Melt 2 tbs. margarine in a pan. Remove from heat and add 2 tbs. sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Stir with a spoon to combine, then work with your fingers until you achieve a crumb topping. Set aside. Break up yeast in a bowl and mix in 1 tbs. sugar. Combine well until it liquefies. Stir in water. Set aside. Combine margarine with milk and heat to scald. Cool to lukewarm. Use a large bowl to beat egg yolks with sugar and then add the milk mixture. Stir in the salt, raisins and yeast. Add the flour all at once. Beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add additional 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of flour and mix it in well with your hand. Knead on a lightly floured surface about 10 minutes. Round up the dough in a greased bowl, turn greased side up. Cover with damp towel and let rise in a warm area approximately 2 1/2 hrs. (bulk will double.) Punch down and let rise 1 1/2 hrs. or until double. Grease 10" tube pan. Punch down dough and place it in tube pan, cover, and let rise for an hour or until double. Brush top with 1 egg yolk beaten with 2 tsp. water. Distribute crumb topping lightly and bake at 300 degrees for 1 1/2 hrs. Cool in pan 10 minutes. COTTAGE CHEESE FILLING FOR BABKA: Combine all ingredients. When Babka dough has been punched down after the second rising, spread or roll dough into rectangle. Spoon filling along center of dough. Fold dough over filling making ends meet. Place in pan and bake according to Babka directions. Filling should be at room temperature. Fills one Babka. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>1. Pierce the skins of the eggplants several times and place them on a baking sheet. Bake at 400F for 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the outsides crinkle and the insides become very soft. 2. When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides. 3. Using a food processor puree the pulp with the lemon juice, tahini, garlic, parsley, and salt until smooth. Cool to room temperature. 4. Line a warmed pita pocket with leaf lettuce, spoon in the baby and serve as is, or, if desired, top with a sprinkling of feta cheese. Meal Planning: *preparation Time: 15 minutes; Baking Time: 40 minutes. Serve with soup or salad. *Smoky eggplant flavor and creamy texture of tahini with lemon also makes a good dip with crudites. Prepare as a side dish for a Middle Eastern Combo Plate with Hummus (79) or White Bean Dip (87) and Carrot Salad (p321) *For a nondairy alternative, top with chopped fresh tomatoes, chopped black olives, and alfalfa sprouts.

Dissolve the 1 tbsp. sugar in lukewarm water and sprinkle yeast over it. Let stand 10 minutes. Add yeast mixture to the cooled (lukewarm) milk. Beat in 3 cups flour until smooth and let rise in a warm place until bubbly, approx. 1 hour. Beat egg yolks until light, then add sugar gradually while beating. Add salt, melted butter and orange rind. Beat egg whites until frothy. Combine egg yolk mixture and egg whites with the sponge and mix well. Stir in enough flour to make a very soft dough and knead continually for 15 minutes. When raisins are used, they should be added after dough is kneaded. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk. Punch down and let rise as before. Grease tall round pans generously and coat lightly with dry bread crumbs. (Coffee or Crisco tins make good containers for Babka.) Form dough into a ball, small enough to fill 1/3 of a container. Let rise in a warm place until dough barely reaches the top. Brush the loaves gently with a beaten egg, diluted with 2 tbsp. water. Bake in preheated 375 degree F. oven for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 325 degrees F. and bake for 30 minutes. Then again lower temperature to 275 degrees F. and continue baking 10 minutes. The baking period depends on size of loaves. If Babka is turning dark, cover with aluminum foil. Remove baked loaves from the oven and let them stand in the pans for 5-10 minutes. Take each loaf out very carefully. Cool completly. Babka is always sliced in rounds, across the loaf. Yield: five or six loaves. MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MasterCook recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Eggplants, about 1 1/2 lbs.</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Tahini (sesame seed paste)</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Freshly chopped parsley,</li>
      <li>Paprika or pomegranate</li>
      <li>Seeds to garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cover baking sheet with foil. Wipe eggplant and pierce with point of sharp knife. Place on prepared baking sheet and bake in preheated oven 35 to 45 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel eggplants and remove seeds. Place in container of food processor and sprinkle with lemon juice to keep from browning. 2. Add tahini, garlic, and salt. Process until smooth. 3. Spread onto serving platter and pour small amount of olive oil over top. Garnish with chopped parsley, paprika, or pomegranate seeds. Serve with warmed pita bread and crudites. Cover and store in refrigerator. Notes: Baba ghanoush is a traditional dish of Lebanon and Syria, and is often served with raw or blanced vegetables. The combined flavors of eggplant, garlic, and lemon juice are very Mediteranean. For a smokey flavor, grill eggplant over hot charcoal instead of baking in the oven. Variation: In Greece, olive oil is used instead of tahini. In Syria yogurt is added for a lighter tasting dish. In Turkey it is called Hunkar Begendi, tahini and garlic are omitted and 1 cup white sauce and 1/3 cup grated cheese are mixed into the eggplant and heated before serving.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Herb-seasoned stuffing mix</li>
      <li>2 Whole skinless chicken breasts; each cut in half</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Plain yogurt</li>

      <li>Cinnamon sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a food processor or blender, reduce the stuffing mix to coarse crumbs. Pour them onto a sheet of wax paper. Coat one piece of chicken breast with yogurt as thickly as possible (admittedly, this is a messy step), then dip it into the crumbs to coat. Lay the chicken in an oiled baking dish large enough to hold chicken and peaches in one layer. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Surround the chicken with the peach halves, cut side down. Sprinkle the peaches (not the chicken) with cinnamon sugar. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the breasts are just cooked through but not dry.

    <title>Baked Chicken with Mint and Red Onions</title>
    <category>Poultry</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Fresh mint leaves (don't chop or tear up)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Rice wine</li>
      <li>1/4 cups White wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Chicken pieces w/skin (drumsticks, thighs, breasts)</li>
      <li>1/2 Red onion (or several small red onions)</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Dried rosemary</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Trim the excess fat from the chicken pieces, but leave at least some of the skin on. I personally like the taste of chicken skin, but I can understand wanting to remove it for health reasons. Compromise--leave just a little bit on! Place in a bowl with the rice wine and vinegar. Let marinate for at least 30 min. 2. Lay a piece of foil over the bottom of a baking dish. Grease the surface of the foil, and lay a bed of mint leaves on top of it. Use only enough so that the chicken will neat little bed to lay upon! 3. Cut the red onion into coarse pieces. Sprinkle loosely on top of the mint leaves. Sprinkle some salt over the onion and mint. 4. Peel the garlic cloves, and cut each in half. Take the chicken out of the marinade and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper to taste. Place the pieces on top of the mint and onions. Take the garlic pieces and place them between chicken pieces (or even on top, if you like!) 5. Bake in a 350 degree oven for around 30 min. (depending on how much chicken you used), or until fully cooked. Fully cooked means that when you poke a knife next to the bone, there won't be any bright red blood running out. Turn chicken pieces over once during baking. When done, turn the oven onto broil and broil the chicken, skin side up, for about 5 min., or until skin is lightly brown. Serve with rice! The mint and onions soak up a lot of nice flavor, and the garlic turns out slightly roasted and soft. I like to pour a little soy sauce and sesame oil on top of my rice with this dish, but that's just me.

      <li>FOR BAKED CHICKEN Place 1/4 c. Baking Mix per cut up chicken in brown paper bag. Skin chicken pieces and wash in cold water; blot dry with paper towels. Moisten chicken with tomato juice or skim milk--we're talking damp, not wet. Put all chicken pieces in bag at once; close bag, trapping air inside, and shake until all pieces are coated. Add more mix, if necessary. Arrange chicken on a cooling rack to dry 15 minutes while oven preheats to 450 degrees. Spray a shallow roasting pan liberally with cooking spray or grease with mixture of lecithin and oil. Arrange chicken pieces skin-side down and bake on lower rack of oven 15 minutes. Turn chicken and continue baking 20 minutes until tender, golden brown, and no longer pink inside. FOR BAKED FISH Rinse fish fillets and blot dry. Cut into small portions or sticks. Combine 1 egg white and 2 T. skim milk; pour baking mix into shallow dish or plate. Dip fish pieces in milk mixture, then press into baking mix to coat. Arrange on lightly greased baking sheet and let dry 10 minutes while oven is preheating to 425 degrees. Bake about 15 minutes.

      <li>Recipes by Jacqueline Higuera McMahan These simple corn cakes are the perfect accompaniment to grilled meats or poultry, or to a bowl of fiery chili. The texture is grainier than cornbread and the flavor is reminiscent of tamales made with fresh corn. They're irresistible! INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan. Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Gradually beat in the masa harina, water and cornmeal to make a thick batter. Blend in the grated corn and sugar. Gently blend in the baking powder, salt and cream. Pour into the prepared pan, cover tightly with foil, and bake for 35 minutes, or until the cake is firm. Cut into squares and serve hot or warm. Serves 8. PER SERVING: 145 calories, 2 g protein, 19 g carbohydrate, 8 g fat (5 g saturated), 21 mg cholesterol, 209 mg sodium, 2 g fiber.

Now my mother often does the same thing. The secret to light cornmeal is to cook it on the stove, then bake it." Serve this cornmeal with roasted meats, cooked vegetables or a salad. In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat; cook onion, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until golden. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in cornmeal until well coated. Stir in milk, salt and sugar; cook, stirring constantly, for 15 to 20 minutes or until thickened. combine eggs, cream and baking powder. reserving 2 Tbsp for topping, gradually stir in egg mixture into cornmeal; cook, stirring for 7 minutes or until very thick. Pour into greased 12 cup (3 L) casserole dish. Drizzle reserved egg mixture over top; bake, uncovered in 325F oven for 1 hour or until golden.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, garlic and parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Place chicken on a baking sheet. Sprinkle each breast with a pinch of poultry seasoning, creole seasoning and granulated garlic. Using a pastry brush, brush each breast with a little of the butter mixture. Bake at 375 degrees for 1 hour, turning once half-way through baking time. Place chicken under the broiler if it's not brown enough. Use chicken immediately, or refrigerate for use in chicken salad, or freeze for later use. Notes: Recipe can easily be doubled. Extra butter mixture can be brushed on top of biscuits before baking to add flavor. Recipe from Waldine Van Geffen vghc42a@prodigy.com. Formatted by Lynn Thomas dcqp82a@prodigy. com.

Spoon the spinach over the bottom and carefully transfer the cooked codfish over the spinach, reserving the wine liquid in the first dish. Reduce by 1/2 the wine liquid in the metal baking dish and add it to the cheese sauce. Bring to a boil stirring with a wire whisk.

Stuff into cod immediately before baking. Remove bone from whole cod (head, tail and fins removed). Stuff interior of cod with savoury stuffing (see below). Bind cod with twine to hold in stuffing, and top generously with salt pork fat back. Bake cod with open side/salt pork up at 350 Degrees F for one hour or until salt pork is brown and crunchy. That's about it, you could sub in bacon for the salt pork, but it is good with the salt pork. Enjoy. MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MealMaster recipe list.

Place a pineapple ring under each hen, leaving a space between each hen. In small saucepan put butter, Kitchen Bouquet and orange marmalade. Heat together until butter has melted and mixture is blended. Spoon over hens and bake at 350 degrees until hens are tender, about 1-1/2 hours, basting often. If sauce cooks down before hens are done, add a little hot water to the pan to assure having some of the delicious sauce left to accompany the hens. If hens appear to be getting dry during the baking, place a piece of foil loosely over the pan to retard the browning. For entertaining, onions should be removed from the hens before serving; as a family enjoyment, leave the onions in. REFRIGERATE OVERNIGHT From &lt;A Taste of Louisiana&gt;.

    <recipetext>
      <li>http://www.goodcooking.com/Cornbeef.htm Open the package of corned beef and rinse under cold water. Place in a pot with 1 sliced onion, the carrot and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and simmer for two hours, partially covered. Remove from the pot and place in a baking pan on top of two sliced onions. Combine the ingredients for the baking mixture and mix well. Pour the non-alcoholic beer over the corned beef then, place the baking mixture over the top of the corned beef and cover loosely with aluminum foil and place in a pre-heated oven at 325 degrees F for 1 1/2 hours. Uncover during the last half hour and begin basting with the pan juices. Check for tenderness and if necessary cook a little longer until the desired doneness is achieved. You may also want to briefly place the roast under a broiler to crisp it up. Remove from the pan and place on a serving platter and keep warm. Place the juices in the baking pan in a sauce pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook until slightly thickened, like maple syrup. Slice the roast across the grain of the meat and serve with the reduced sauce and your choice of accompaniments. =A9 1997 by Good Cooking, Inc. Recipe by Chef John J.

      <li>&gt;From The New New York Times Cookbook. I've made this, and it's fantastic! I'd also serve this with a chunk of crusty bread to soak up some of hte sauce. Open the clams and arrange them on half shells neatly on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 450. In a saucepan, combine the chopped shallots and wine and cook briefly, stirring. Cut the butter into 1- inch cubes &amp; add it. Heat, stirring, until the butter melts. Add salt, pepper, tabasco, worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Bring just to the boil, stirring. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Add the basil &amp; let the sauce cool to lukewarm. Spoon the sauce over the clams and bake for 10 minutes. Run the clams under the broiler for about 15 seconds, no longer. Sprinkle with parsley.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 large Green bell peppers</li>
      <li>1 large Red bell pepper</li>
      <li>3 Jalapeno peppers</li>
      <li>5 Garlic cloves; peeled</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Small cilantro sprigs</li>
      <li>1 can (28-ounce) and 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can plum tomatoes; drained</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 Tablepoon paprika; divided use</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Ground cumin; divided use</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Optional: pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>4 1/2 pounds Chicken pieces; skin removed</li>
      <li>1 large Onion; halved and sliced</li>
      <li>Cilantro sprigs for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Notes: From Orange County Register 1. Broil green and red bell peppers, turning every 4-5 minutes, until their skins are blistered and charred, a total of about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, broil jalapeno peppers, turning often, about 5 minutes in all. Transfer peppers to a bowl and cover; or put in plastic or paper bag and close bag. Let stand 10 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, mince garlic in a food processor, add cilantro sprigs, and mince together. Add tomatoes and chop coarsely by pulsing. 3. Peel the jalapeno and bell peppers using a paring knife. (Wear gloves when handling jalapeno peppers if your skin is sensitive. Be careful not to touch eyes or face.) Halve the peppers; discard the seeds and ribs. Cut bell peppers into 1/2-inch dice. Chop jalapeno peppers. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 4. In a medium saute pan, warm the olive oil over low heat. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the paprika and 3/4 teaspoon of the cumin and mix well. Stir in tomato-garlic mixture, jalapeno and bell peppers and salt and pepper. Bring sauce to a simmer. Cook uncovered over medium heat, stirring often, 10 minutes or until sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasoning; add cayenne pepper if desired. 5. Put chicken pieces in shallow roasting pan large enough to hold them in 1 layer. Season them on both sides with salt, pepper, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika. Rub spices into chicken pieces. Top chicken with sliced onion. 6. Cover chicken with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover, turn pieces over, and bake 20 minutes. Add one-third cup hot water to pan juices. Spoon pepper sauce over the chicken. Bake, uncovered, basting once or twice, about 15-25 minutes or until chicken is tender and juices run clear when thickest part of a thigh piece is pierced with sharp knife. Serve chicken with sauce; garnish with cilantro sprigs.

    <title>Baked Chicken W/mint and Red Onions</title>
    <category>Poultry</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Fresh mint leaves (don't chop or tear up)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Rice wine</li>
      <li>1/4 cups White wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Chicken pieces w/skin (drumsticks, thighs, breasts)</li>
      <li>1/2 Red onion (or several small red onions)</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Dried rosemary</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Trim the excess fat from the chicken pieces, but leave at least some of the skin on. I personally like the taste of chicken skin, but I can understand wanting to remove it for health reasons. Compromise--leave just a little bit on! Place in a bowl with the rice wine and vinegar. Let marinate for at least 30 min. 2. Lay a piece of foil over the bottom of a baking dish. Grease the surface of the foil, and lay a bed of mint leaves on top of it. Use only enough so that the chicken will neat little bed to lay upon! 3. Cut the red onion into coarse pieces. Sprinkle loosely on top of the mint leaves. Sprinkle some salt over the onion and mint. 4. Peel the garlic cloves, and cut each in half. Take the chicken out of the marinade and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper to taste. Place the pieces on top of the mint and onions. Take the garlic pieces and place them between chicken pieces (or even on top, if you like!) 5. Bake in a 350 degree oven for around 30 min. (depending on how much chicken you used), or until fully cooked. Fully cooked means that when you poke a knife next to the bone, there won't be any bright red blood running out. Turn chicken pieces over once during baking. When done, turn the oven onto broil and broil the chicken, skin side up, for about 5 min., or until skin is lightly brown. Serve with rice! The mint and onions soak up a lot of nice flavor, and the garlic turns out slightly roasted and soft. I like to pour a little soy sauce and sesame oil on top of my rice with this dish, but that's just me.

      <li>VENISON CHILI as served at the California Grill located at Disney's Contemporary Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Eating Well magazine Nov 1997. Original recipe used more oil and trimmed venison from the leg or shoulder. We tested with lean beef sirloin steak; nut brown ale; roasted green chili peppers. VARIATIONs: Suitable for lean lamb, pork or turkey; adjust the baking time. Served with cornbread and slaw. [1] In a shallow bowl, stir together chili powder, paprika, cumin, salt and pepper. Dredge meat with spice mixture. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour or overnight. Preheat oven to 325F. In a Dutch oven (stove top and oven proof casserole), heat one-third of the oil over medium high heat. Add half the meat and sear until browned on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes; transfer to a plate. Sear remaining meat in another third of the oil. Set aside. Reduce heat to medium and add rest of the oil; add diced onion and celery and cook, stirring, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, jalapeno, oregano and bay leaf; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add beer and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until liquid is reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and their juice and bring to a simmer. Add browned meat. Cover, transfer to the oven and bake for 1-1/4 hours, or until meat is very tender (up to 2 hrs). Meanwhile, spray a nonstick skillet, place over medium high heat. Add bell peppers and saute until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. When the meat is tender add the bell peppers, black beans and chopped cilantro and parsley to the chili; cover-- or partially cover if the stew is too moist. Return pot to oven and bake another 15 minutes. Remove chili from oven. Discard bay leaf. Stir in lime juice. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve in bowls, garnished with a dollop of sour cream and cilantro and parsley sprigs.

      <li>6 tablespoons Melted unsalted butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Rinse chicken and pat dry. Place one piece at a time, skinned side down, between two sheets of pastic wrap and pound with a flat surface mallet until each breast is about 1/8 inch thick. In a shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic salt and pepper and 1 tsp of the oregano and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the 1/4 cup butter, remaining oregano and parsley. Arrange the pounded chicken breasts skinned side down. Spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the butter mixture across each piece about an inch from one of the long sides and place a strip of the Jack cheese over the butter. Fold the short ends over the filling and then fold in the long sides and roll to enclose the filling. Dip each bundle into the 6 tbsp of melted butter, drain and roll in the bread crumb mixture until coated evenly and well. Place bundles, seam side down and slightly separated into a 10x15 inch rimmed baking pan. Drizzle with the remaining butter. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours over overnight. Bake uncovered in a 425 F oven until chicken is no longer pink when slightly slashed (Don't cut the filling!!), about 20 minutes. Serve at once!!

Using a can of whole green chiles, discard the ptih and any seeds. Cut the chilies into 1 inch stirps and divide into eight equal portions. When filling the chicken breasts, place one portion of the chile, atop each strip of cheese. serve the chicken with the following tomatoe sauce. Stir together 1-15oz can of tomatoe sauce with 1/2 tsp each ground cumin and sugar and 1/4 cup sliced green onions ( including tops.) Cook over medium heat, stirring, until hot.

    <recipetext>
      <li>In our local newspaper there was a piece about a new cookbook, *Looneyspoons* by Janet and Greta Podleski. Low fat, but really not low enough for this group, at least in the recipes they shared, but could be easily adapted I think. Also there are meat based recipes in the book. The following is something I'm going to try, adjusting for fatfree. Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve with pita. Makes 1 1/2 cups. Comments from the authors: *This recipe is a creamy, garlicky dip made of lean beans that is similar to hummus, but lower in fat. and make it once and everyone will be begging you to make it again, it is a recipe that really gets around.* Nutrition Data (as per ORIGINAL recipe) Calories 73 Carbohydrates 14 g Protein 6 g Sodium 228 mg Cholesterol 0 mg Fat 2 g Calories from fats: 18% I believe this is acceptable for this list with the adaptions *starred and it is a bit different from other bean dips I've seen on this list, especially the coriander.

      <li>Evelyn Scoville The cook of this period would have been likely to cook the beans far more tender than currently is trendy and to use melted butter in the dressing, since vegetable oil-except olive oil-still was little used. Young green beans make an excellent salad. String them, cut them into inch lengths, boil them in salted water until tender, and drain them. Beat the vinegar and water together. Add the salt, pepper, and the onion, and pour over the beans and onions. Mix well and set away for an hour or two before using for the tastes to blend.

      <li>Date: Mon, 24 Jun 1996 11:36:59 -0400 From: zadofea@matthey.com I stumbled over this very simple recipe for bean salad and have been addicted ever since. I make a huge bowl each week and nibble it when I get the munchies Drain and rinse the beans very, very well. Mix in all ingredients and pour on seasoned rice vinegar. I usually use 1/2 a cup. Let it sit for at least a couple of hours (it tastes best the next day). Its so simple yet so good. FATFREE DIGEST V96 #175 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Eggs, separated</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Beer, room temperature</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The ultimate batter for deep frying... DIRECTIONS: BEER! Whether it's ale, lager, pilsener, or stout, is terrific for cooking. Beer makes a batter for deep frying and smooths a French onion soup. And what could be more compatible for lunch on a rainy Vancouver weekend out on the boat fishing for Spring salmon than a cold beer with a hot pastrami sandwich smothered with brown beer mustard? This is the late James Beard's recipe for batter to French fry vegetables. Trim your veggies, wash, dry thoroughly, dust with flour, dip into the batter, and fry in oil at 360 F. until done. However, James "missed the boat" on this one - it's far better for deep frying halibut, cod, or any other seafood. The batter puffs up because of the beer's yeast, fries quickly, and as a result, doesn't commit the cardinal sin of seafood preparation - overcooking. I think few of our piscine friends benefit from deep frying as a cooking method, but that's another story. To prepare, place flour in a mixing bowl and add egg yolks, salt, oil, and beer. Stir batter until thoroughly mixed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours or as long as 24 - the longer the better, to a point. Just before using batter, stir it well again. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry; gently fold egg whites into batter. Does 2 lbs. of veggies or 6 fish fillets, depending upon their size. Makes 4 servings. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>4 large Egg Yolks</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Melted Butter</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cayenne</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Green onions should be finely chopped along with some tops. ~------------------------------------------------------------------------- In a small non-aluminum saucepan, bring the wine, vinegar, onions, tarragon, parsley and peppercorns to a boil. Cook until it is reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Strain the liquid and press the solids to get as much of the flavor from them as possible. Add the lemon juice and water to the reduced wine mixture and heat to a simmer. Whisk the egg yolks in the top of a double boiler until thick and lemon colored. Add the above liquid, a tablespoon at a time and whisk after each addition. The mixture should be thick and almost double in size. Dribble in the butter, whisking constantly until the mixture forms a slowly dissolving ribbon when drawn across itself. Whisk in cayenne. At this point it should be ready. It is important to know that the sauce will thicken considerably within the first few minutes after it is removed from the heat. The mistake that most make, is that they try to make Hollandaise and Bearnaise sauces too thick while over the heat, and the next thing they have is scrambled eggs floating in butter. The sauce will thicken in the first minute after removing from the heat. From: Syd's Cookbook. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/sydsbook.zip</li>

      <li>1. Clarify the butter by heating slowly. When it stops inging it's clarified and you can pour off the top part the solids will be in the bottom of the pan. Keep warm. 2. In a small saucepan, heat the vinegars with the shallots, tarragon, salt and pepper. Let boil slowly until all the liquid has been reduced. 3. In a stainless steel bowl, beat the egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of water over a double boiler on a low flame. This will create a lot of volume to the yolks while cooking them. Beath until you reach the ribbon stage. 4. Stir in the clarified buytter, very slowly, as you would do for a mayonnaise. Add the reduction. 5. Correct the seasonings with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Keep in a warm place for up to three hours.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 pound Fresh bean sprouts thoroughly washed and drained</li>
      <li>3 medium Garlic cloves peeled and minced</li>
      <li>2 medium Scallions; trimmed &amp; minced</li>
      <li>1 1" cube ginger peeled and minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Oriental sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Mirin (sweet rice wine)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Spicy sesame oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes 4 to 6 Servings Fresh bean sprouts are a must for this recipe from China's Hunan province. The canned variety don't have the requisite crispness. Keep a close eye on the toasting sesame seeds so they don't burn. PREHEAT OVEN TO 300F. Toast the sesame seeds by spreading them over the bottom of a pie tin. Roast for 12-to-16 minutes, stirring often, until they are golden. The seeds can be toasted in advance and stored in an airtight container. Place the bean sprouts in a large heatproof bowl and set it aside. In a medium-size skillet set over moderately low heat, stir-fry the garlic, scallions and ginger in the oil for 2 to 3 minutes, until they are limp. Add all the remaining ingredients, increase the heat to moderate, then boil the mixture, uncovered, for 1 minute to slightly reduce the liquid. Pour the boiling dressing over the bean sprouts, toss well, then cover the bowl and chill the salad for several hours. Toss again before serving.

Place soaked beans into a pot with stock or broth and enough water to cover by 2 inches. Add bay leaf and whole garlic cloves. Heat to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until beans are tender (about 45 minutes). (The beans should be softer than al dente but not cooked to the point where they begin to disintegrate.) Don't drain beans until fennel and tomato sauce is cooked. 3. Meanwhile, cut stalks off fennel bulb. Chop the feathery leaves and reserve. Trim off root end of the bulbs; cut bulbs in half lengthwise and slice thinly. There should be about 8 cups of fennel slices. Discard stalks or save for soup. Heat 1/3 cup olive oil in a large heavy skillet; cook fennel over medium-low heat until wilted and translucent, about 10-12 minutes. Do this in batches if necessary. 4. Add tomato to fennel; cook 5 or 6 minutes. Discard garlic and bay leaf from beans; drain beans. Add beans to the skillet, tossing gently to combine all the ingredients. Add parsley and chopped fennel leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, add lemon juice and remaining olive oil to taste. Serve warm or at room temperature.

    <ingredient>
      <li>40 pounds Chicken wings</li>
      <li>1 gallon Texas pete; Crystal, you know hot sauce</li>
      <li>2 Sticks butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh ground pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 Jar Marie's Blue Cheese dressing; (up to 3/4)</li>
      <li>Salt to taste; (I swear it's always been just so much in my hand)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the 40lb of wings up. Drumette, middle section, tip Ahemm discard tips or make into stock. Deep fry the wings until the outside is chewy. You can flour the wings if ya want a lil crust. Wings should be safely edible at this point. In a pot melt butter add everything but dressing. Bring up to a good simmer add dressing. Cook until cheese lumps dissolve to an even texture (you can still have small bb size or bigger lumps) The addition of more or less dressing will increase or decrease the heat of the wings to a point. Some should always be used. If ya want it hotter add some habeneros, it's your life. Sauce the wings (tupperware bowl with lid and shake, individually with tongs, in a bag, in a garbage can all at once, in a garbage bag all at once, you get the idea) Smoker should be going, I also did this for years on the brinkman bullet ( no water pan grill on top charcoal pan at lowest height) put in wings at 200 to 300 degrees and smoke with MESQUITE until sauce it totally adhered to the wings. You can touch them without getting a totally sauce covered finger. Serve with Blue cheese dressing (Marie's is the best I've had) for dipping. I don't bother cutting up no damn celery. Eat more wings. I hope whoever tries them enjoys them as much as my people do. Posted to bbq-digest by Bear &lt;bear@fred.net&gt; on Jan 15, 1997</li>

Remove and immediately dip into ice water to stop the cooking. Drain well and set aside. Using a strainer to hold the prawns, boil for 6 seconds until they turn pink. Drain well. Combine prawns and lime juice in a medium bowl; let stand 1 minute. Add the dried shrimp, noodles, fish sauce, sugar, mush- rooms rooms, celery, green onions and coriander leaves. Arrange the salad on a bed of lettuce and serve immediately. PER SERVING: 105 calories, 5 g protein, 15 g carbohydrate, 0 g fat, 32 mg cholesterol, 912 carbohydrate, 1 g fiber.

      <li>Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl or in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the shortening and cut in or process until the mixture is the consistency of coarse meal. Pour in the milk and stir or process just until the dough holds together. If it is dry or crumbly, add more milk. If it is too wet, add more flour. Knead briefly in the food processor, then turn out onto a floured board or beat 1,001 times with a rolling pin. when it's ready, the dough should "snap" when you hit it. Fold the dough in half. Roll out the folded dough until it is 1/2 inch thick. Cut with a 1-1/4-inch biscuit cutter into small rounds. Prick each round with a fork, making two parallel sets of holes in the biscuit. keep rolling out the dough, folding before cutting, until all the scraps are gone and you have made about 100 biscuits. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the biscuits on a lightly greased pan. Bake for 30 minutes, until crisp, but not browned. They should open easily when split with a fork. They will keep for weeks tightly covered in a tin or in the freezer. Split in two before serving.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>20 Chicken wings</li>
      <li>7 1/2 ounces Tomato sauce (half can)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Orange marmalade</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Honey</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ginger, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Fermented chili sauce (Summit brand)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Pepper vinegar</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves, peeled</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt (scant)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons MSG</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water (more as needed)</li>
      <li>dashes Tabasco, to taste (or other hot pepper sauc )</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut off spurs from chicken wing-tips and rinse chicken wings. Place in pressure cooker with water; bring to pressure and cook at high heat for up to five minutes. Remove from pressure cooker and place cooked-out fat in wide-mouthed, tapered jar for other uses. Blend all ingredients except chicken and Tabasco (or hot sauce) until fairly even consistency, with no large chunks of ginger or garlic. Place 3/4 of sauce in pan. Roll wings in sauce; remove wings to broiler pan (with slotted top). Bake at 325 degrees F. for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and spoon about half of remaining sauce on top of each piece; broil for 5 minutes. Add Tabasco or other hot pepper sauces to taste and serve. Beau's notes: * Use vinegar "which has been used to keep a supply of bird's-eye peppers." * After discarding chicken spurs, wash hands with very warm water and Dial soap (and follow up with isopropyl alcohol rinse); wash all utensils with bleach. (One should always regard chickens, even if processed in USA or inspected by USDA, as unclean! USDA inspectors are notoriously less than thorough, and U.S. packing houses often neglect basic hygienic rules in working with chickens, especially in dealing with their entrails, waste products un-excreted, etc. And one should not expect much better from out-of-country chickens.)

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>5 cups Dashi; (or light chicken or beef stock)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Light soy sauce</li>
      <li>Splash sake'</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cornstarch mixed w/ 2 T. water</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs; beaten</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Fresh ginger juice *OR*</li>
      <li>Finely chopped lemon rind or green onion</li>
      <li>4 Stalks trefoil (mitsuba) *OR SUBSTITUTE following; cut into 1" lengths</li>
      <li>1 Sprig either watercress or parboiled fresh; spinach</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To assemble and serve: Bring the dashi just to a boil over high heat, then simmer while seasoning to taste with the salt, soy sauce, and sak‚. Reduce heat to low. With the heat on low, stir in the cornstarch-and-water mixture. Stir for 30 seconds or so till thick and smooth and raise heat to bring the soup to a high simmer. Never let it boil. Slowly pour a thin stream of beaten egg in a spiral over the entire surface of the soup. Do not stir immediately, but let the egg start to set, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir soup gently and constantly with a wire whisk for another minute or so to allow the egg to separate into threadlike filaments. Finally, add the ginger juice and trefoil and remove from heat immediately. Pour into individual soup bowls, garnishing each with a bit of trefoil from the soup. Serve immediately. Variation: Use 1/2 cake tofu (bean curd), cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Add after the egg and let simmer till heated (about 30 seconds) before adding the ginger juice and trefoil. NOTES : Trefoil is a member of the parsley family. It is an annual herb that has thin greenish-white stalks approximately 6 to 7 inches long, topped with a comopund leaf of three flat, deeply cut leaflets. Depending on the variety, the leaves range in color and size from pale to bright green and from small to rather full. It has a flavor somewhere between sorrel and celery and an attractive light green color, mitsuba is used in many Japanese dishes as a flavor and color accent. Used only fresh, it is often lightly parboiled beforehand to rid it of any "parsleyish" overtones. Also, professional cooks usually use only the stems because leaves and stems have different cooking times, but it is not necessary to be so fussy. The leaves become bitter if overcooked, so only lightly parboil or very gently stirfry.(Request more info if desired. I ran out of room here. I didn't know MC had a size limit!)

      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cups White vinegar</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SALAD</li>
      <li>1 can (16 oz) green beans; drained</li>
      <li>1 can (16 oz) yellow wax beans; drained</li>
      <li>1 can (16 oz) kidney beans; rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>1 can (16 oz) garbanzo beans; rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>1 can (4 oz) sliced mushrooms; drained</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 Rib celery; chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 Green pepper; seeded and chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>DRESSING: Mix together and set aside Salad: Combine all ingredients for the salad. (The garbanzo beans are optional.) Pour dressing over, and mix well. Place in a container with a cover, and let chill in refrigerator for 12 hours or longer. To serve, drain dressing from the salad. Serve on a lettuce leaf with a wedge of hard-boiled egg for garnish. This keeps about 2 weeks in the fridge. Notes: This was my late mother-in-law's recipe. She never added the garbanzo beans, but I do because Kenny loves the nutty flavor they add to this salad. You can add more or less pepper and celery, if desired. One time I drained a can of canneloni (is that right? those white Italian beans that look like kidney beans?)...and that was really good as well. Also note that I usually buy the store brand of veggies...I can't tell the difference between them and their many cents higher name brands with lots of advertising.

      <li>Ingredient Group: SEE DIRECTIONS</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I'll start from scratch. Skip down if you're a good bean cooker. (I don't use a pressure cooker anymore since I exploded one in cooking beans.). Soak beans overnight. Next morning drain off the old water and put in fresh water to cover and cook slowly for a couple of hours or until the beans are tender. For black beans throw in a LOT of garlic. I use about 1/4 cup chopped garlic. (It's easier to use the pre-chopped garlic in the jar if you don't mind the oil it's in). Put the garlic in while the beans are cooking. After they are cooked put in the salt. (to taste). some dishes are beans and cornbread, topped with picante sauce, chili with black beans (and lots of the black bean juice), Moors &amp; Christains--make white rice with pepper strips and onion strips and just about 10 minutes before the rice is done throw in some drained black beans, Chalupas--puree the beans and cook in a frying pan with some oil,more garlic, and some picante sauce. Spread mixture on tortillas and bake in the oven at 350 degrees. Tortillas are crispy after about 20 minutes if you want them open-faced. If you want soft tacos, take them out after about 10-15 minutes. Top with shredded lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, sour cream, cilantro and more picante sauce. Black bean enchiladas--roll up black beans, onion, tomato, shredded cheese in tortillas. Make a sauce of oil, cumin, chile powder, garlic and cornmeal. Stir in oil for awhile till roasted and then pour in water or tomato juice (like you're making gravy). When it very first starts getting thick, pour over the tortillas and bake 350 degrees 20 min. Casserole: Make rice with whatever vegetables you have (carrots, celery, peppers, onions, garlic). About 5 minutes before the rice is done throw in some drained black beans. You can also probably make something pretty tasty using phyllo leaves (strudel leaves) from the grocery store, but I don't have a recipe for it. Probably whole black beans, spinach, and cream cheese and fold the phyllo into little triangles like you're folding a flag and bake 350 for about 25 minutes. I haven't tried todo this one, but I like using phyllo leaves. Pretty much the black beans can be used in anythng remotely latinamerican. Use lots of garlic--there's no such thing as too much garlic. Enjoy and tell me if you have any other recommendations. Recipe by: Amy Ellen Nixdorf Posted to TNT Recipes Digest, Vol 01, Nr 947 by HallieByrd &lt;HallieByrd@aol.com&gt; on Jan 18, 1998</li>

      <li>Scald milk, stir in sugar, salt, butter and cool to lukewarm. Combine water and yeast in a large bowl, stir until dissolved. Beat in milk mixture and egg. Add half the flour, beat until smooth. Stir in remaining flour to make a stiff batter. Add more flour if necessary. Cover tightly and refrigerate dough at least 2 hours. It may be refrigerated up to 3 days. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured roll out one half to a 9x18" rectangle. Brush with half the melted butter. Sprinkle half the cherry mixture over dough, pat lightly. Starting with an 18" edge, fold 1/3 of dough to center. Then fold over remaining 1/3 of dough to make a 3-layer strip. Pinch to seal edges. Cut each strip into 8 sections. Make 4 slashes through a cut edge of each section. Place on a greased baking sheet, and shape into bear claws by separating the slashes. Repeat using remaining dough and cherry mixture. Blend yolk and water, brush onto rolls. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup nuts and 2 tablespoons sugar. Let rise about 10 minutes, and bake until golden brown. CHERRY MIXTURE Make this recipe while the Sweet Rich Dough is rising. Drain and chop cherries, drain again on paper towels.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Steak Meat from Bear; Beef, Elk or Venison, sliced 1/4" thick</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion; sliced 1/8" thick</li>
      <li>5 Cloves garlic cloves; Crushed And Diced</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Butter Or Margarine; (3/4 Stick)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>6 ounces Fresh Mushrooms; sliced 1/4" thick (Or 3 Cans, Drained)</li>
      <li>2 Cubes beef bouillon</li>
      <li>1 Cup(Or More) wine; red, (Burgundy, Port, Madeira Or Your Favorite)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Catsup</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cracked Black Pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Sour cream; light</li>
      <li>1 package Merlino's™ Kluski Egg Noodle; Cooked As Directed (1/8" Square Or Your Favorite Egg Noodle)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Put on the water for the noodles. Bring to a boil. Dissolve the beef bouillon in the wine. 2. Prepare the meat by removing any silverskin, fat or whatever. Slice the meat across the grain into 2- 3" strips. Then, in a medium skillet, sauté the meat using 2 tablespoons of butter till the meat is just browned but still rare. (DO NOT OVERCOOK, it will be tough!) Remove from skillet, reserving all juices. 3. With two tablespoons of butter, sauté the onions, garlic and mushrooms until the onion is just tender/crisp. Add the reserved juices, flour, salt and pepper. Stir until smooth. Blend the wine/bouillon mixture into the onion, garlic and mushrooms. Add the catsup and sautéed meat. Bring to boil over medium/high heat while stirring. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes to thicken sauce and tenderize meat. 4. Cook the noodles per directions and drain. (approx.. 10 minutes, do not rinse) Add 2 Tablespoons butter, stir until coated. Or omit the butter and stir the stroganoff mixture directly into the noodles. 5. Fold the sour cream into the sauce mixture and heat through. Do not allow to boil. 6. Serve over buttered noodles with crusty bread and one or two of the following: steamed broccoli, grilled zucchini, pickled beets, chilled pears. Suggested Wine: Whichever was used for sauce Serving Ideas : Steamed broccoli, grilled zucchini, pickled beets, pears NOTES : You may use your own preferences whether to use butter or oil. You may use 1 to 1-1/2 pounds of any whole or ground meat or make it vegetarian with no meat. The meat flavor strength goes up as follows, Elk, beef, bear, venison. Use a wine that corresponds in flavor strength to the type of meat. The wine chosen will also affect the sweetness of the dish. I.E. Venison and Burgundy, Elk and Madeira. You may need to increase the cooking time a bit to tenderize the meat or to thicken the sauce prior to adding the sour cream. See "Hamburger Stroganoff" for a non-wine, creamy sauce.

    <category>Info</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound To 2 lb cream cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>2 To 3 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Yogurt or sour cream</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Liqueur or fruit/vegetable puree</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Or more other flavored extracts, if desired</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's where it gets fun. The more cream cheese you use, the denser the cheesecake will be (but not dry!) The more eggs you use, the fluffier it will be. There's a delicate balance here - 1 lb cheese and 3 eggs will give you a fluffy cheesecake, but if you use 2 lbs cheese, 3 eggs is an absolute must if you don't want it to be flat. More eggs than 3, and you'll taste the eggs. 1 lb cheese and 2 eggs is a nice balance, too, but going any lower than that you'll just end up with something flat. The powdered sugar works best for two reasons - number one, powdered sugar contains corn starch, which acts as a thickener, and number two, you don't have to worry about the grittiness of undissolved sugar in your cake. The yogurt or sour cream adds moistness and a little bit of tang to the cake. It's not necessary, but it adds oomph to either a bland cake or a citrus-flavored cake. For liqueur, add no more than 1/2 cup if you're using the yogurt or sour cream, and make sure you're using the three eggs. If you eliminate the yogurt/sour cream, you can increase the liqueur to 3/4 cup, and 2 eggs will work (but three is still better - two works best only if you're not using the yogurt/sour cream &gt;and&lt; your liqueur is only 1/2 cup.) A fruit or vegetable puree should be relatively dry - drain off the liquid in a sieve, or put it in a saucepan, mix in some cornstarch, and heat it until it's thick. You can use an entire cup of puree if you eliminate the yogurt/sour cream. Either mix in the puree with the batter, or reserve a cup or so of batter, mix it with the puree, then swirl it into the cheesecake. The vanilla is a must, in my opinion. Lots of times, I'll throw in an extra teaspoon for good measure. Other extracts can enhance the flavor - banana extract in a strawberry cheesecake, coconut extract or almond extract in an Amaretto cheesecake, etc. Another addition would be cocoa or chocolate. Cocoa mixes in nicely without making the cheesecake gooey - 4-6 Tbsp will do it. Melted chocolate or white chocolate chips shouldn't really exceed 6 oz, even 4 oz will usually do enough for the flavor. If you're doing the swirl thing, use only 2-3 oz melted chocolate for the batter that's being swirled in. Make sure the melted stuff is cooled before you mix it in.

    <recipetext>
      <li>(From:Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure by L.J. Sass) In a 1 1/2 or 2 quart casserole, combine all the ingredients. Place the rack and 2 cups of water in the cooker. Lower the uncovered casserole onto the rack with the aid of a foil strip. Lock the lid in place. Bring to high pressure and cook for 20 minutes (for long grain brown, Wehani, brown basmati) or 25 minutes (for short grain brown). Allow the pressure to come down naturally for 20 minutes. Remove the lid. If the rice is not quite tender, replace (but don't lock) the lid and allow it to steam for a few more minutes. Lift the casserole with the aid of the foil strip. Fluff up rice before serving. This has always worked for me except that I have to cook it a few minutes longer because of altitude. In fact, it's the only way I can cook it without having a really bad pan to clean up. Posted to fatfree digest by "Richard M. Swanson" &lt;sharpy@sedona.net&gt; on Apr 5, 1998</li>

      <li>Recipe by: The Ultimate Pasta Machine Cookbook Following the instructions given in your owner's manual, prepare and set up the pasta machine with an extruder die to make the desired shape of pasta. All ingredients must be at room temperature. Place the liquid ingredients in a glass measuring cup. If less than 3/4 cup, add some water to make up the balance. Add the dry ingredients to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the pasta machine on. Slowly pour the liquid ingredients through the feed tube. Mix for approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough appears to be coming together in soft pea-sized crumbs. Following the instructions given in your owners' manual, begin to extrude the dough. Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and discard. As the pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from the machine. Cut with a sharp knife or scissors at desired lengths. Place extruded pasta on a wire rack or on a clean kitchen cloth. Let sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking, or store for later use.

      <li>TAMALES WORLD TOUR SHOW #WT1A05 Combine the water and kelp in a large pot. Bring the water to a boil, removing the kelp just before water boils since it emits a strong odor. If the fleshiest part of the kelp is still tough, return it to the water for a few more minutes, along with a little cold water. (Soft kelp means sufficient flavor has been extracted.) Remove the kelp and bring stock to a full boil. Add 1/4 cup cold water to bring the temperature down quickly and add the bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, and then immediately remove from the heat. (If bonito flakes boil too long, the stock becomes bitter.) Allow the flakes to settle to the bottom of the pan, then filter the stock through cheesecloth.

      <li>~------------------------------OPTIONALS ~-------------------------------- NOTE: TO PREWARM A CANDY THERMOMETER, SIMPLE PLACE IT AN A SMALL SAUCE PAN OF COLD WATER AND BRING IT TO A BOIL. LET IT SIMMER UNTIL YOU NEED THE THERMOMETER. STEP 1: Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs allowing the whites to come to room temperature in a large bowl of an electric mixer. (Return the egg yolks to the refrigerator covering with plastic wrap or water for another recipe.) Fill a glass with ice cubes and water. To make dropped divinities, you will need 2 cookie sheets, topped with greased wax paper. For squares, use a greased and wax paper-lined 8 X 8-inch pan. Measure the sugar, corn syrup, ice water and salt and dump into a heavy 2-quart saucepan with a tight fitting lid. STEP 2: Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over low heat. Syrup will become clear, gritty sounds will cease, and the spoon will glide smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. STEP 3: (OPTIONAL): Cover pan with a square of wax paper and lid, pushing down firmly. Steam for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the sugar crystals. (Listen to make sure the pot doesn't boil over. To double-check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper in place.) STEP 4: Wash down any crystals clinging to the sides with a brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath. Introduce the prewarmed thermometer. No need to stir. STEP 5: Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. If your mixer is a heavy duty one, you can wait until the bubbles in the syrup become very large and airy before beating the egg whites. Otherwise, do it now when the thermometer registers 240 Degrees F. (115.5 C.). STEP 6: Test the syrup when the thermometer registers 246 degrees F. (119 C.). Continue testing until it reach the firm-ball stage, 246 to 260 degrees F. (119 to 126.5 C.). Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice water. It will have to be forced into a ball, but once formed, it should hold its shape but give under pressure. Return the thermometer to the hot water bath to soak clean. STEP 7: Dribble the syrup into the egg whites in a slow, steady stream, beating at slow speed. Tilt the syrup pan to get the last drop but do not scrape the pan. Once the syrup is completely incorporated, change to a flat whip if you have one. STEP 8: Have patience and continue beating. The amount of time you spend mixing depends on the power of your mixer. If you have a heavy duty or commercial one, you can go to full speed and make the divinity in less than 5 minutes. With less powerful ones, it can take up to 20 minutes. The important thing is to beat at the highest speed of your mixer. Also if it is a hot and humid day, it will take longer also. STEP 9: Test the divinity. The first and most important test occurs when you lift the beaters. If the candy falls back in ribbons that immediately merge back into the batter, it isn't done. Eventually, a stationary column will form between the beaters and the bowl. Candy will lose its sheen/gloss and stop being sticky; a teaspoonful dropped onto wax paper will hold its shape, even a peak. If you machine is laboring and the candy is not quite there yet, you have two choices: Pour anyway and put into a frost free freezer to set up....or finish by hand. STEP 10: Fold in the flavorings and nuts and/or other optional items using the mixer or if very thick, a wooden spoon. STEP 11: Drop or spread the divinity either on wax paper-covered cookie sheets or the buttered pan. Dripping it by teaspoon is harder work for you but it ripens quicker and is ready to eat sooner. A neat trick is to put the candy into a pastry bag and pipe onto the wax paper. If you spread it in the pan, you will have to wait up to 24 hours before it is ready. But you maybe one of those that think it is better when it is 24 hours old. Score and cut into squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in a refrigerator. Makes 1 pound but looks like more. Recipe CANNOT be doubled; it can be frozen but not for extended periods of time. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Melted margarine/butter if Desired In large bow;, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend well. In small saucepan, heat water, milk and 1/2 cup margarine until very warm (120-130 F.). Add warm liquid and egg to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, stir in an additional 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour until dough pulls clenaly away from sides of bowl. On floured surface, knead 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cups flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80 to 85 F.) until light and doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. Punch down dough several times to remove all air bubbles. Divide dough in half. To make PAN ROLLS, lightly grease two 13x9-inch pans. Divide each half of dough into 16 equal pieces. Shape each into a ball, pulling edges under to make a smooth top. PLace balls, smooth side up, in greased pans. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size, about 20-30 minutes. Heat oven to 400 F. Uncover dough. Bake at 400 F. for 16 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove rolls from pans immediately; cool on wire racks. Brush with melted margarine. TIP: To make dough a day ahead, after first rise time, punch down dough, cover and refrigerate dough overnight. Shape dough as directed in recipe; let rise a second time until light and doubled in size, about 25 to 35 minutes. Source: The Complete Pillsbury Book of Baking From the collection of K.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: morrissey@stsci.edu (Mostly Harmless) Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1993 16:50:10 GMT &gt;Here are some carrot recipes i have gathered from the net lately. Enjoy! Basic cream cheese frosting (will frost 2 9-inch round layers). Beat butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Blend in vanilla and salt. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating until smooth and creamy. Gradually beat in milk, if necessary, until proper spreading consistency is obtained. Blend in nuts, if desired, or sprinkle them on top of the cake after you have frosted it. Variations: 1. Omit the salt and use unsalted (sweet) butter. 2. Add more vanilla. Try 1 Tbl, rather than 1 tsp. Then add or subtract based on taste. 3. Change the ratio of cream cheese to butter (2:1 in the above recipe). I have seen ratios as low as 4:3. There is no upper bound on the ratio, as I have seen recipes which use no butter at all. Just cream cheese, vanilla and powdered sugar. 4. Replace half of the vanilla extract with almond extract, walnut extract, or banana extract. 5. Rather than using milk to thin the frosting, use a. 1/4 C (melted) frozen orange juice and/or lemonade concentrate. b. 1/4 C maraschino cherry juice. Stir in 1/4 C minced maraschino cherries. 6. Replace all or part of the nuts with toasted coconut flakes. 7. Replace 1/2 C powdered sugar with 1/2 C firmly packed brown sugar. Melt the brown sugar with all of the butter and a little milk. Cool. Then beat in the cream cheese and the rest of the ingredients (remember to remove 1/2 C of the powdered sugar). REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CAKES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Egg substitutes</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 cup Rice milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 cups Whole wheat pastry flour or</li>
      <li>Unbleached white flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend at high speed for 1 min. Refrigerate, covered for 2 hrs. before cooking. Batter should have consistency of heavy cream. If necessary, thin with more liquid. To cook crepes, heat an omelet or crepe pan on low heat for a few minutes. No need to add oil, these cook fine without it. Remove from heat, pour in 3 or 4 tablespoons of batter and tilt pan so batter coats the bottom. Put pan on burner, cook crepe for a few minutes over medium low heat until lightly browned or batter begins to bubble. Flip crepe over and cook other side for about 30 sec. Gently remove and place on a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter, stacking crepes as they're cooked. Use with favorite breakfast, dinner or dessert crepe filling. Note: I didn't notice this until I started typing this in, but I didn't cook mine on med-low heat. I heated my pan on med-high and turned it down a notch when ready to cook. They turned out fine, didn't stick and the edges were just a little crispy (the way I like 'em).

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 1/2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>6 Eggs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Northern Italian Cooking Put flour on a pastry board and make a well in the center. Break the eggs into well; beat with a fork. Draw some flour from inner rim of well over eggs, beating constantly. Keep adding flour a little at a time until you have a soft dough. Put dough aside. With a pastry scraper, remove bits and pieces of dough attached to board. Lightly flour board and your hands. Knead dough 10 to 12 minutes, adding flour a little at a time until dough is smooth and pliable. Insert a finger into center of dough. If it comes out almost dry, dough is ready for pasta machine. If dough is sticky, knead it a little longer adding more flour. Cut an egg-size piece from dough. Wrap remaining dough in a cloth towel to prevent it from drying. Set rollers of pasta machine at their widest setting. Flatten small piece of dough, dust with flour and fold in half. Run it through pasta machine. Repeat this step 5 to 8 times until dough is smooth and not sticky. Change notch of pasta machine to the next setting and run dough through once without folding. Keep changing setting and working pasta sheet through machine until pasta reaches desired thickness. A good thickness for general use is about 1/16 inch. Sprinkle dough with flour between rollings if it is sticky. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Or, mix in bowl with wire whisk or mixer, first combining flour and eggs, adding liquid gradually. Beat until smooth; add other ingredients. NOTES : Batter can be used immediately. However, an hour or two standing will produce slightly more tender crepes. Or, refrigerate batter up to three days for use as needed. Measure flour and liquid carefully, since consistency of batter is important. (It should be about the consistency of thick heavy cream.) Spoon flour into 1 cup measure and level off with straight edge of knife or spatula. This recipe is for use with the MAXIM Electric Crepe Maker.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Round loaf country bread, not too dense</li>
      <li>6 Cloves of garlic, peeled and cut in half</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire. Cut the middle portion of the round loaf into 6 long slices, each one almost an inch thick. Cut these slices in half, making half-slices that are roughly 3x3x1 inches. When fire is ready, place the 12 slices over it in a single layer. Cook, turning once, until the outsides of the bread are golden brown (with grill marks, if possible). This should take about 2 minutes per side-but check frequently to make sure the bread isn't burning. When the bread slices are done, rub the edges of each one, on both sides, with a cut clove of garlic-lightly or heavily, depending on your garlic preference. Place the slices on a large platter in a single layer. Sprinkle each slice with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, breaking the surface of the bread lightly with a spoon to let the oil soak in. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the slices over and repeat the procedure. Let the slices sit in the olive oil for 10-15 minutes. Serve as is for simple bruschetta.

      <li>1. Shell and devein shrimp, leaving tail segments intact. 2. Prepare any of the batters (see recipes for "... Batter for Deep-Fried Shrimp": "Egg", "Eggless", "Egg-White" or "Separated Egg"). Then holding each shrimp by the tail, dip in batter to coat. 3. Meanwhile heat oil. Add shrimp one by one (if dropped in all at once, they'll form a solid mass), or place in a wire basket and lower into oil. 4. Reduce heat to medium and deep-fry until shrimp float and are golden on both sides. (Depending on size, this will take 3 to 5 minutes.) Drain on paper toweling. 5. Serve hot, garnished with lettuce strips and Chinese parsley, and accompa- nied by plum sauce, hot mustard, catsup or "Basic Pepper-Salt Mix", or "Dip for Deep-Fried Shrimp #1/#2", or "Miscellaneous Dips for Deep-Fried Shrimp". Or serve with a sweet-and-pungent sauce (see recipes for "Sweet-and-Pungent" Sauces). NOTE: See Note under "Deep-fried Shrimp without Batter". VARIATIONS: 1. In step 1, strip off legs and devein, but leave the shells intact; or else butterfly the shrimp. See "Information: Other Seafood".) 2. After step 1, marinate the shrimp in a mixture of 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 3 tablespoons sherry, 1 teaspoon ginger root, minced; and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally. Drain, discarding marinade. Then coat with batter as in step 2, or dredge lightly in flour. 3. In the above variation, add to the marinade any or all of the following: 1 scallion, minced; 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder; a few drops of sesame oil.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Crushed graham crackers (1 package)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Melted butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the graham crackers and sugar, then add butter and mix with a fork until completely moistened. Press mixture into the bottom and up 1/3rd of the side of a 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Variations: Use ginger snaps instead of graham crackers for a spicier crust or for cakes like pumpkin. Use chocolate wafers instead of graham crackers for a chocolate, white chocolate, or certain fruit-flavored or ~topped cheesecakes like raspberry, cherry, or orange. For a sweeter, moister crust (do this only if the cheesecake is going to get eaten quickly, because it gets mushy faster) use brown sugar instead of white.

    <category>Tried</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown rice; short or long-grain</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups Boiling water</li>
      <li>Flavouring options</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt; or to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Pick over, rinse, and drain the rice. Heat the oil in the pressure cooker. Saute the rice until lightly browned, stirring frequently, about 1-2 minutes. [This avoids foaming and reduces the possibility of rice sticking to the bottom of the cooker.] 2. Turn off the heat and stir in the boiling water (watch for oil sputtering), flavouring options, and salt if using. 3. Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure. Adjust heat to maintain high pressure and cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pressure drop naturally while the rice steams in the residual heat for 10 minutes. Reduce any remaining pressure with a quick-release method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. 4. If the rice is not sufficiently cooked, stir in a few tablespoons of boiling water if the mixture seems dry, and replace the lid. Simmer over very low heat for another minute or two, or until done. Fluff with a fork and serve immediately.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Shrimp (up to)</li>
      <li>10 Water chestnuts</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1/2 Scallion stalk</li>
      <li>2 slices Fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sherry</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Oil for deep-frying</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Shell and devein shrimp. Then mince or grind with water chestnuts. 2. Beat egg lightly; mince scallion and ginger root; then add to shrimp mixture along with cornstarch, sherry and salt. Blend to a smooth paste. 3. Shape mixture into walnut-size balls. (To prevent sticking, wet 2 teaspoons in a bowl of cold water; then spoon up a teaspoon of the mixture and toss it between the 2 spoons to form a round, smooth ball.) 4. Meanwhile heat enough oil to float shrimp balls. Add them a few at a time. (Don't crowd: allow room for stirring and for even browning.) Reduce heat to medium and deep-fry, turning shrimp balls occasionally, until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper toweling. 5. Repeat process until mixture is used up, reheating oil each time. 6. Serve shrimp balls hot, sprinkled with nutmeg and lemon juice and garnished with Chinese parsley; or accompanied by a sweet-and-pungent sauce. VARIATIONS: 1. For the shrimp, substitute fresh crabmeat. 2. For the water chestnuts, substitute either 1/2 cup bamboo shoots or 1/4 cup celery, minced. 3. Omit the whole egg. Substitute 1 egg white in step 2; or else dip shrimp balls in the egg white to coat after step 3. 4. Omit the cornstarch in step 2. After step 3, dredge shrimp balls lightly in flour; then dip in whole egg, beaten. 5. In step 2, add 2 bacon strips, minced; or 1 or 2 tablespoons unrendered leaf lard, minced; or 1/4 pound pork, with some fat, minced. 6. In step 2, add any or all of the following: 1/2 garlic clove, minced; a few sprigs of Chinese parsley, chopped; 1 tablespoon soy sauce; 1/2 teaspoon sugar; a few drops of sesame oil. 7. At the end of step 3, roll each shrimp ball in minced smoked ham (about 2 ounces for 1 pound of shrimp) to coat. 8. Omit step 3. Instead of shaping into balls, drop shrimp mixture directly into the hot oil from a teaspoon. (Dip teaspoon in cold water each time to prevent sticking.)

Heat a 10" nonstick frying pan and lightly oil the pan, using a paper towel. Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan and quickly turn the pan to evenly coat the bottom with batter. Cook on one side only until dry on the top, about one minute. These should be only very lightly browned and not too dry, so the pan should not be too hot. Lightly oil the pan before cooking each crepe. Separate the crepes with wax paper until ready to use. The noodles can be refrigerated overnight if you seal them in a plastic bag.

Punch down. Cover and let rise again until double, about 45 minutes. Punch down. On lightly floured surface roll out 1/2 inch thick. With a 3 1/4 inch round cutter cut out muffins. Sprinkle cookie sheets lightly with cornmeal. Add muffins, about 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with additional cornmeal. Cover; let rise until double, about 45 minutes. Heat lightly greased griddle or heavy skillet. With wide spatula carefully remove muffins (do not compress or puncture or they will collapse) to griddle. Bake over very low heat 8 to 10 minutes on each side until light brown. (Muffins should sound hollow when tapped) Cool on racks. To serve, split with fork tines; toast. VARIATIONS - ONION: Add 1 envelope onion soup mix and 3 T nonfat dry milk to yeast-flour mixture and decrease salt to 1 t. Increase butter to 2 T.

Pick over beans and rinse thoroughly. Peel potatoes (I don't) and cut into rounds. Add barley, beans, potatoes, bones and garlic to meat and onions in the saucepan. Add 6-7 cups of cold water, or enough to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for one hour. Skim froth as it rises to the surface. Place the cholent in a preheated low oven (200-250 degrees F) and let it heat until the following day. A few hours before lunch check the cholent. If it is too moist, uncover it and leave it in the oven to dry. This also works great with a clay pot, or in a slow cooker.

      <li>1 small Onion; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium Carrot; peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 small Leek; coarsely chopped</li>

    <title>Basic Egg-Pasta Recipe</title>
    <category>Mixes</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 cups Unbleached all-purpose Flour</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the flour and egg in the mixing bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.Process for a few minutes.The dough will look very granular,like yellow-colored,uncooked cream of wheat.Pinch the dough.It should stock together.If it does not stick,mix in a bit of oil or water. Form a ball with the dough and knead for a few minutes on a lightly floured board.It will become smooth and hard(much harder than bread dough).In a few minutes,the dough should look satiny and smooth.Wrap it in plastic and let rest for about 30 minutes. Then roll out the dough through a pasta roller or by hand.Sprinkle additional flour on the dough as needed to prevent sticking.The dough is quite forgiving and can be handled easily. When the rolled-out pasta sheet feels dry,not sticky,cut into noodles by hand or with the machine. If you have a pasta drying rack,hang the cut pasta on the rack.If not,wrap the noodles around your hand to form a nest and set it on a lightly floured board.Toss with flour on occasion to allow the pasta to dry evenly. Fresh pasta cooks quickly.Add it to boiling water and test a strand every 15 seconds until done. Sometimes,I vary this recipe by adding 1 1/2 tsp. of olive oil and up to 1 tbsp. of a flavoring ingredient,such as minced fresh herbs or garlic,tomato paste or pureed beets. Keeping the same proportions of 1 egg to 3/4 cup flour,the recipe can be multiplied as many times as needed.A 1 egg recipe will feed 1 or 2 people for a main course;a 2 egg recipe feeds 2 to 3.An average size food processor will handle a 3 egg recipe easily.If you need to make more,it is a good idea to make several batches.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>NOTE: I just bought Donna German's book THE BEST PIZZA IS MADE AT HOME and discovered her "secret" for Sicilian pizza dough. Evidently the difference in deep dish pizzas like the Sicilians is that they contain some sugar and a higher proportion of oil. Donna's recipe for the dough is simple.I made this for supper and did the dough in my bread machine on the "dough" cycle. It was made in my largest old iron skillet which I'd sprayed with olive oil Pam. After I took it from the ABM, I made the dough into a circle by trying to imitate those expert pizza chefs who fling the dough around. Mine didn't get flung too high but it worked! I spread it in the skillet and brought up the extra dough to form a lip around the edge, then put the pan to rise for 30 minutes while preheating the oven to 475F. Bake the crust for 5 minutes by itself--but before you do that, prick it well with a fork all over. Before you add toppings, drizzle olive oil on the crust and spread it around with a brush. Toppings are up to you--but I used (in this order) 1 cup mozzarella/cheddar cheese(grated), 2 cloves garlic (crushed), 1 cup slightly cooked fresh broccoli florets, a large sliced tomato, shredded fresh basil and feta cheese to top. It was VERY good! This makes a thick crust but it's so good there was none left to give to the birds! I hope Maria who first requested a Sicilian dough finds this--because I'd like to be able to share more of the goodies from this book with her! There are thin pizza doughs as well--and all kinds of toppings. The comments above were those of my friend Linda Calwell on Proidgy.

      <li>1 cup Butter</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: ADD</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Whipping cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix first 2 ingred. &amp; let set overnight &lt;or for several hours&gt; tightly covered. Add cream &amp; whip with heavy duty mixer or by hand. Divide dough into separate bowls. &lt;I divide into 3&gt;. Makes nice batch of each. For each bowl, add whatever color/flavor, etc you like. Below are some ideas: Vanilla cremes: add vanilla ****to taste. Chocolate cremes: add melted dark chocolate to taste. Mint center: add drops of peppermint oil &amp; pink coloring. Black Walnut center: add drops black walnut oil &amp; bl walnuts. Peanutbutter cremes: add smooth or crunchy peanut butter. Pineapple cremes: add drops pineapple oil, chopped candied pineapple &amp; chopped pecans. Jelly: add fruit "flavored" jelly into candy mold with matching flavored oil w/creme center. Nut center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as filling; dip in white/tinted, or milk chocolate. Chocolate covered cherries &lt;cream type:&gt; wrap creme center mix around a well-drained marachino cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill &amp; dip in choc.* Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge. The acid in the cherry causes it to start cordialing &lt;liquifying&gt; quickly. Will liquify some, but some will remain "creamy" because of the butter. Coconut cremes: add maccaroon coconut &amp; drops or coconut oil For any dipped cremes: Form 1" balls, let crust over &amp; dip in compound coating chocolate. This is also called "dipping chocolate." I prefer the brand "Merckens." It seems to take more abuse/ reheating, or getting too hot, etc. Dolores McCann, Hamilton Ohio Dolores McCann, Prodigy Food &amp; Wine Board From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1 medium Onion</li>
      <li>1 medium Celery stalk</li>
      <li>1 medium Garlic clove</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 cups Vegetable; chopped in 1/2 to 1-inch pieces:</li>
      <li>Cauliflower</li>
      <li>Asparagus</li>
      <li>Broccoli</li>
      <li>Any other vegetable</li>
      <li>5 cups ;water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Miso, light OR</li>
      <li>2 Vegetable bouillon cubes</li>
      <li>Pepper, freshly ground, opt.</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Bring water to a boil in a tea kettle. Coarsely chop the onion and celery. Thinly slice the garlic. 2. In a soup pot, heat oil, onion, garlic and celery. Cook and stir 1 minute over medium heat, then add vegetable. Continue cooking and stirring 1 minute longer. 3. Add boiling water and bring back to a boil over high heat. Stir briefly and reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook 8 minutes. Lift cover, stir in miso, and continue cooking and stirring for another 2 minutes, until miso is dissolved and vegetables are tender. (At this point, you may puree soup directly in the pot with a hand blender, liquefying a small amount of soup with the tahini in a separate bowl and returning it to the pot. Or, follow steps 4-6. 4. Pour soup into a bowl to cool. Remove 1/2 cup of broth from soup and stir remaining soup to cool it. While soup is cooling, place tahini and 1/2 cup broth in a blender. Blend to a smooth cream. Set aside. 5. Place three-fourths of soup in blender and liquefy to a cream. Pour into original soup pot. Place remaining one-quarter of unblended soup in a blender. Pulse-blend for 2 to 3 seconds, allowing mixture to remain lumpy and textured. Pour it into creamed portion in the original soup pot. 6. Place soup over medium heat and stir in tahini mixture. Gently reheat soup, taking care not to let it boil and stirring frequently. Add pepper to taste. Variations: If you don't have light miso, substitute 2 vegetable bouillon cubes, 2 tbs powdered vegetable broth, or 5 cups of homemade stock in place of 5 cups water. Creamed soups can be served hot or cold. If serving cold, skip the reheating. Add 1/2 tsp dried thyme, basil or marjoram to the sauteeing vegetables for fuller flavor. Add 1 tbs nutritional yeast to the soup pot when you add the water. Note: After the tahini mixture has been added to the cream soup, boiling will make the tahini itself thicken and the soup will be too thick. Take care to reheat it GENTLY, _not_to_boil_!

Grease an 8-inch crepe pan or frying pan lightly with butter and heat until the butter is quite hot but not burned. Ladle about 1/3 cup (or a bit less) of the batter into the pan and rotate the pan to spread the batter evenly. Cook the crepe until it looks firm and is lightly browned at the edges (about 1 minute) then turn the crepe over with a thin spatula or your fingers and cook the other side for about 30 seconds. Grease the pan with a bit more butter about every other crepe, or when the crepes begin to stick. Repeat until the batter is gone.

      <li>Put in crockpot and cook about 4-6 hours on high or overnight on low. Beans should be soft (small white beans take longest, pinto beans shorter) Add spices, veggies, etc. (see below) cook about another hour. Spices:, veggies, etc: 1) 1 tsp dried cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1-2 Tbsp. soy sauce, a few chili peppers, chopped, chopped green pepper, can chopped tomotoes, some frozen corn. (Good with black beans) 1/2 tsp liquid smoke tastes good added. 2) 1 tsp cumin, 1 can chopped green chilis, chopped green pepper, 1 Tbsp soy sauce (good with white beans). 3) 1-2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/4 cup molasses, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp dried mustard, (good with pinto or black eyed peas) Garbanzo beans I usually use as a substiute in chicken recipes, so I'll freeze them with just the onions and garlic. Frozen black eyed peas are also a good staple to have on hand (for some reason that's the only legume that comes frozen except for lima beans which I don't like).

      <li>Egg whites</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Chicken Velvet, known also as Chicken Essence, is an elegant and festive dish. It calls for chicken breast (skinned, boned and minced to a pulp) to be combined with egg whites and then either sauteed in oil or poached briefly in a rich concentrated stock. The basic preparation includes the following steps: 1. Skin and bone the chicken breast; then pound flat with a mallet or the side of a cleaver. 2. Cut the meat in 1-inch cubes; then mince or grind in any of the following ways: a. Mince on a hardwood cutting board, removing tendons. b. Grind in a mortar and pestle. Remove tendons. c. Blend at low speed in a blender, turning the motor on and off. Remove and discard gristle that attaches to blades. d. Run twice through a hand grinder (set at the finest setting). Remove gristle. 3. During the mincing or grinding above, add about 1 tablespoon of water, a drop at a time, to give the mixture a paste-like consistency. (Sherry may be used in place of water.) 4. Beat the egg whites until fluffy, but not stiff and dry; then fold into chicken mixture. From &lt;The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook&gt;, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>2 Fistfuls mung beans</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Turmeric powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>

      <li>Ginger</li>
      <li>Seasonings: mustard seeds; cumin seeds and slit green chillies in</li>
      <li>Butter or oil</li>
      <li>Garnish: lotsa chopped coriander leaves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pressure cook about two fistfuls of mung beans with water adding 1/4 tsp turmeric powder to it. (I usually put one fistful for one person if daal is not the main dish in the meal. Otherwise , you might want to add two fistfuls per person. It is probably surprising, but this measuring scheme works for me) Once cooked, stir the beans till they can no longer be seen separately. This step is very important. If the beans are nicely cooked, just a stir of the spoon will make a smooth paste. This is the reason why we are pressure cooking the beans. It is not only faster, but also cooks the beans thoroughly. Cooking in a pan is possible, but be prepared to keep stirring for about an hour. Also, if more water is required, add after the daal has been cooked. For those who have tried this dish, know what consistency they need. For others, daal should be pouring consistency. Add salt. If you like garlic, fry crushed garlic in little bit of butter or oil and add to the daal along with the puree. May also want to add ginger, though I give it a miss (don't like the taste, you know). Let this cook (on the stove, not press. cook). Seasoning: Mustard seeds, cumin seeds and slit green chillies in butter or oil. (First add mustard seeds. Wait till they burst, add cumin seeds and green chillies. Do not fry green chillies for too long, as they will lose their flavor) Add to daal at the very end. Garnishing: Lotsa chopped coriander leaves. Note: To make it fiery, why not add little bit of cayenne pepper powder. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Inn recipes *1 recipe Piret's Quiche Pastry or Vienna Pastry. 1. Line the quiche pan with the pastry, pinch up a rim, and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Partially bake the pastry, if you wish, and set it aside. 2. To make the filling: Whisk together the eggs, flour, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Blend in the cream, and then the milk. 3. Evenly distribute whatever cheese, meat, and/or vegetables you are using in the prepared shell, and pour in the custard filling. (if you are using high-moisture vegetables, such as tomatoes, zucchini, or mushrooms, they should be cooked first to evaporate some of their water content.). 4. Preheat oven to 375. Place the filled pan on a baking sheet. Generally, custard quiches should be baked for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custard is just set. Let the quiche rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving it. Make one 9 to 11-inch or four 4-inch tarts. This is the basic custard mixture that goes into many of our quiches. Some of our favorite combinations appear below, but we hope you'll use them as inspiration for your own creations. Just about any combination of grated cheese, vegetables, leftover meat, poultry, or seafood, or whatever else appeals to you can be added to this all-purpose custard.JM.

      <li>Let cream cheese sit out until it's room temperature, nice and soft. Beat the cream cheese and sugar together until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time (break them into a separate cup - one teensy bit of shell will ruin everything!) and beat just until mixed. Add remaining ingredients and beat just until mixed. Pour into chilled shell and bake at 325 for 50 minutes to an hour. Jam may be melted and poured evenly over the top of the cooled cake. Fruits may be arranged on top of a cooled cake, then covered with a melted jam glaze. 4 oz chocolate or white chocolate chips, melted with 2-3 Tbsp butter and maybe 1 -2 Tbsp whipping cream (if desired) can be poured on top of the cooled cake. For a yogurt or sour cream topping, cook the cake only 50 minutes, cool the cake 15 minutes, mix together 1 cup yogurt or sour cream with 1/4 cup sugar (regular is OK since this is so liquid) and 1 Tbsp vanilla or other flavoring (lemon juice, extract, etc.) raise the oven temperature to 475 and bake another 10 minutes.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva) Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 00:45:07 GMT Make the sponge about 12 hours ahead: In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 1/4 cups water and the flour, beating by hand or in a mixer with a dough hook for 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the sponge stand at room temperature for 12 to 14 hours. Make the dough: Stir the whole wheat flour, warm water, salt and about 4 cups of the all-purpose flour into the sponge until the dough becomes hard to work, then turn it out onto a well-floured surface. Let the dough rest while you clean the bowl. Now start kneading, slapping the dough around, scraping it up, gradually adding about 1 1/2 cups more all-purpose flour and kneading until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until almost triped in volume, about 2 hours. Turn the dough out again onto a floured surface, punch it down, and tear off a small hunk (6 ounces) to reserve for the levain (see Note). Divide the remaining dough in half and shape each piece into a 1 1/2 inch thick disk. With the palms of your hands, coax the sides of each disk down and under all around, stretching the gluten cloak and plumping up each loaf into a round shape. Pinch together the seams on the bottom and place the rounds seam-side down on 2 lightly greased baking sheets. Cover loosely with a towel and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450F. Paint the top and sides of the risen loaves with the beaten egg white to glaze. Sprinkle, if you wish, with one of the toppings and place on the middle rack of the oven. Immediately throw a few ice cubes on the oven floor to create steam. Add more ice after 3 minutes and again after 6 minutes. Bake for a total of 15 minutes. Then reduce the oven temperature to 350F and bake for 20 minutes longer, or until the bread sounds hollow when the bottom is tapped. Turn the oven off and let the bread rest in the hot oven for 15 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool. Note: Put the hunk of reserved dough (about 6 ounces) in a covered jar with 1 1/2 cups of warm water. This is the levain, which will go into the next loaf. Let stand at room temperature for 12 hours, then refrigerate. The levain will keep for up to 10 days; freeze for longer storage. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Bone fish, discarding the head, and cut crosswise in 1-1/2 to 2-inch sections, or in 3/4-inch cubes. 2. Wash fish; then dry well with paper toweling. (When using thick fillets or fish steaks, score the skin of each with crisscross gashes.) Season lightly with salt and a dash of pepper. 3. Cover with any of the coatings indicated below. 4. Heat oil for deep-frying. Add fish sections and deep-fry until golden. Drain on paper toweling. 5. Serve with a sweet-and-pungent sauce or with any dip or sauce for deep-fried fish (see recipe for a "Sweet-and-Pungent Sauce", a "Fish Sauce" or a "Five Willow Sauce"). COATINGS FOR DEEP-FRIED FISH (IN PIECES): a. Dredge fish in cornstarch or flour. b. Coat fish with a paste made by blending 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 3 tablespoons cold water. c. Dip fish in a mixture made of 1 egg, beaten; 1 tablespoon soy sauce; and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Then dredge lightly in cornstarch. d.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Cut bean curd cakes in 1-inch cubes. Blot gently with paper toweling to remove as much moisture as possible. 2. Heat oil and deep-fry bean curd cubes, several at a time, until puffed up and golden. Drain on paper toweling. Sprinkle with salt and serve hot. NOTE: Deep-fried bean curd cubes can be added to any stir-fried dish. They should be added at the very end, only to heat through (so as not to lose their interesting texture and crispness). Speared on toothpicks, these are also excellent as an hors d'oeuvre to serve with cocktails. VARIATION: At the end of step 2, also sprinkle lightly with hot sauce.

      <li>4 Bean curd cakes</li>
      <li>6 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Peanut oil</li>
      <li>1 dash Pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Cut each cake of bean curd in 4 to 6 slices. Meanwhile bring water to a boil. 2. Carefully place bean curd slices, a few at a time, in a sieve. Plunge into boiling water for 30 seconds; then drain. Arrange on a serving platter and let cool. 3. Mix soy sauce and peanut oil and pour over bean curd. Serve, sprinkled with pepper. NOTE: Bean curd is already cooked and can be eaten as is. The blanching improves its flavor and texture. VARIATIONS: For the soy sauce, substitute oyster sauce. For the peanut oil, substitute 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. After step 2, top bean curd with 1/4 cup dried shrimp (soaked) or 2 tablespoons cooked shrimp, chopped coarsely; and 2 tablespoons scallion, minced. Season as in step 3, but omit pepper. Then refrigerate, covered, only to chill (about 20 minutes). In step 3, use mixture as a dip instead of pouring it directly over bean curd. In step 3, sprinkle the bean curd with the soy sauce and pepper. Garnish with 1/2 cup Chinese parsley, chopped, and 2 scallion stalks, shredded. Then heat the oil until smoking and pour over.

      <li>CRUST: Mix all ingredients. Roll out between wax paper, place in 9" pie pan, poke bottom of crust a few times with a fork, and bake at 350 F. for 10-15 minutes. FILLING: Combine all ingredients except egg whites in a deep saucepan. Beat until thoroughly blended and all powder is dissolved.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>douglas allen thompson &lt;aesculus@TSO.UC.EDU&gt; Take the chicken and steak and slightly freeze them so that cutting the meat into thin 1/2" strips is easier. Trim off any fat or chicken skin. In a large glass bowl or casserole make the marinade (mix all ingredients). Put the meat in this and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to sit in the fridge overnight or make this early in the morning for the evening meal. Remove meat from marinade prior to grilling. Discard the marinade and Do Not Re-use. Once meat has drained place the beef on the hot grill first, laying the strips perpendicular to the grill rods,spokes,etc. otherwise the meat falls into the fire. After you get the beef on add the chicken the same way. The meat will cook quickly and you only need to flip it once.As the beef and chicken cook add the shrimp. The shrimp may cook so fast that you don't have to turn it. When the shrimp curls up and goes pink it's done.Remove all the meat from the grill and serve with grilled onions and green pepper slices.(These can be made ahead of time and kept warm.) Serve meat and grilled vegetables with large flour tortillas that have been heated up. Top with sour cream,salsa,or, if you wish, Melinda's. One suggestion: This works best if one person works the grill and starts to turn meat while someone else is adding the meat to the grill. Everything cooks fast and this is something that you don't want to overcook. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

In a large bowl mix together flour and salt; rub in butter with your fingers. Place bowl with yeast mixture on electric mixer fitted with dough hook. Start machine on slow speed and gradually add flour mixture to yeast mixture. Your dough should be firm; add more flour if needed. Mix until dough comes together. Flour work surface and turn out dough. Knead until smooth and elastic. Oil a bowl and add dough, turning to coat top. Cover and set aside to double in size. Turn out onto a lightly-floured surface. Punch dough down and cut into small workable pieces of dough. Shape into desired shape, such as knots, crescents, breadsticks, round rolls, or Parker House rolls; place on a baking sheet, leaving enough room between them for rolls to double. Cover with a towel and place in a warm draft-free place to double. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. For shiny rolls, brush with egg wash, if desired. Sprinkle tops with choice of suggested garnishes. Bake until golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. For thicker, harder crusts, place a small bowl of water in your oven during cooking to provide steam; you can also spray your oven with a water mister several times during baking.

      <li>From: Francine Boucher &lt;fboucher@sympatico.ca&gt; Date: Tue, 21 May 1996 15:22:14 -0500 Melt chocolate in a double boiler. Stir in butter, then boiling water, then sugar and salt. Cook stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. The sauce is best when served warm. Either serve immediately or reheat in double boiler for 10 minutes or microwave for 1 minute. To store pour into strilized glass jars. Allow sauce to cool before refrigerating. It will keep for 6 months in the refrigerator. Variations: : Add any of the following flavorings in place of or in additon to the vanilla: : 1 ts orange extract or 1/3 c orange juice : 1 ts mint extract : 1/8 c crushed strawberries or rasberries, chopped raisins or nuts : 1 tb Creme de Menth, Coffe liqueur, Spice orange Cordial or other : flavored liquer. : 1 ts instant coffee yield: 16 oz SOURCE: CHEAPER AND BETTER ALTERNATIVES TO STOREBOUGHT GOODS BY: NANCY BIRNES FOUND BY: FRAN MCGEE Posted to Master Cook Recipes List, Digest #93</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Vanilla Extract</li>

      <li>Combine the first 4 ingredients, stirring with a wire whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth. Carefully pour the egg mixture evenly into 5 (5x1) round baking dishes or custard cups. Place in a roasting pan large enough to accomodate the dishes and add 1/2-inch of water to the roasting pan. This step creates a water bath to prevent curdling. Bake at 275 for 45 to 50 minutes or until almost set. Cool the custards in the water in the pan set on a wire rack. Remove from pan when cooled, cover and refrigerate overnight. When ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar evenly over each custard; place each custard on a cookie sheet or jelly-roll pan. Broil 5 inches from heat. If using an electric oven, leave door partially open. Broil until the sugar melts. Let stand 5 minutes to allow sugar to harden. NOTES: Handle with care. These are extremely hot. Place custards as close to heat source as possible. To achieve a "cracked" effect, broil custards in a pan full of ice. Dixie Crystals sugar is reputedly the best for making this dessert. ***When finished cooking, the center will still be slightly liquid.

    <ingredient>

      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Milk</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mixing crepes by hand. Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl. Break the eggs into another bowl and mix until yolks and whites are blended. Make a hole in the middle of the dry ingredients and pour in beaten eggs. (French chefs often break the eggs right into the dry ingredients but this makes mixing more difficult. Stir the flour mixture into the eggs little by little. The dough will be difficult to work and it may be necessary to add a little milk (or whatever liquid is used in the particular recipe) to incorporate all the flour. Add the liquid a spoonful at a time and mix it in thoroughly before adding more liquid. When the mixture becomes easy to work (when about half of the liquid has been used) the remainder can be added in two portions. Add melted butter (and flavorings if indicated). Mix again, cover and set aside for at least an hour but not more than 6 hours at room temperature. Crepe batter can be held overnight in the refrigerater. If necessary, the crepe batter can be cooked immediately, but the "resting" time allows the flour to absorb more liquids, makes the mabber easier to handle, and gives the crepes more flavor. Since flours vary in their ability to absorb liquid, if the crepe batter seems too thick when you are ready to cook it, a small amount of extra liquid can be added at this time. The consistency could be at least as thin as heavy cream. From: You can do anything with crepes. 1993 Cooking Echo Picnic Cookbook exchange.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Cooking onions</li>
      <li>2 ounces Green ginger</li>
      <li>2 ounces Garlic</li>
      <li>2 3/4 pints Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 8oz tin tomatoes</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Tomato puree</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Paprika</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a recipe for a base curry sauce. It is not a dish in itself but requires adding other ingredients to it to finish a particular dish. Stage 1 Peel and rinse the onions, ginger and garlic. Slice the onions and roughly chop the ginger and garlic. Put the chopped ginger and garlic in a blender with about 1/2 a pint of the water and blend until smooth. Take a large saucepan and put in the onions, blended garlic and ginger and the rest of the water. Add the salt and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat to very low ans simmer with the lid on for 40-45 minutes. LEAVE TO COOL Stage 2 Once cooled, pour about half of the boiled onion mixture into a blender and blend until perfectly smooth. (at least 2 minutes). Pour the blended onion mixture into a clean pan or bowl and repeat with the other half of the boiled onions. Wash and dry the saucepan. Reserve about 4 tablespoons of the sauce at this stage to use in cooking the meat in your chosen curry. Stage 3 Pour the can of tomatoes into the rinsed blender and blend until perfectly smooth (about 2 minutes). Into the clean saucepan, put the oil, tomato puree, turmeric and paprica. Add the blended tomatoes and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the onion mixture to the saucepan and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer. When froth rises skim this off. Simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally to stop the sauce sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. Use immediately or refrigerate for upto 4 days. This recipe has been taken from the book 'The curry Secret' by Kris Dhillon. isbn 0-7160-0850-5 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #257 by Jack Elvis &lt;jackelvis@moonlink.net&gt; on Sep 29, 1997</li>

    <category>Bread</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Margarine</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Crisco lard</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon White vinegar (up to)</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Ice water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a very easy yet flaky piecrust. I use a pastry blender, for me an absolute must. Some people get away with blending with a fork, but I rarely have any luck doing this. In the old days lard was used instead of the lighter shortenings that we have now. Lard does make a delicious crust, but it is really hard on the old heart. I suggest the following: In a medium-size bowl stir the flour and salt together. Cut in the shortenings using a pastry blender. Keep working the flour and shortening until the mixture is rather grainy, like coarse cornmeal. Mix the egg and vinegar together and, using a wooden fork, stir the mixture into the flour. Add enough ice water so that the dough barely holds together. Place on a marble pastry board or a plastic countertop and knead for just a few turns, enough so that the dough holds together and becomes rollable. I roll my dough out on a piece of waxed paper. It is easy to handle that way. If you have a marble rolling pin this will be easy. If you use a wooden one be sure to dust a teaspoon of flour on it a couple of times when you are rolling the dough. NOTE: If you wish to use this recipe for a fruit or sweet pie simply stir in 1 tablespoon of sugar along with the flour and salt. This recipe will make enough dough for one 9-inch pie with two crusts, top and bottom. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>Date: Sat, 23 Apr 1994 14:29:53 GMT With some trepidation, I tried cherimoya for the first time, and was delighted with its flavor when baked. As a raw fruit, it wasn't worth the novelty price paid for it. Scrub the fruit clean. Cut cherimoya horizontally in half and place fruit face down on an oiled pie tin. Bake 400 F until the juices begin to caramelize and an aroma fills your house (about 1 hour). Serve face up. The flavor is like a ginger custard. The texture is one of custard. The seeds are a bit of a bother, distributed throughout the fruit, so eat carefully. Raw, the fruit resembles an apple-pear. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /FRUIT From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 package Dried chipped beef</li>
      <li>6 Chicken breasts; boned</li>
      <li>6 slices Bacon</li>
      <li>2 cans Cream of celery soup</li>
      <li>16 ounces Sour cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Chop beef finely; place in bottom of casserole dish. Wrap each chicken breast with a bacon slice. Place each piece on its own bed of chipped beef. Mix together undiluted soup and sour cream; pour over the chicken. Bake at 275 for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Serve chicken on a bed of rice or surround with Duchesse potatoes. There is a overabundance of sauce with this, so you could put in double the chicken if the need arises. Notes: I have used low fat cream soups, and I have used low fat sour cream both work well, I substituted the bacon with canadian bacon, because I did not like the idea of the soggy bacon peices in my cassarole :-) Posted to TNT - Prodigy's Recipe Exchange Newsletter by Jsgrl430@aol.com on Sep 9, 1997</li>

For the first time ever, I used those frozen boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to cook with soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this recipe, you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce. This is delish!!!

Hint: Rival's recipe called for 4 ounces of mushrooms, but I doubled the quantity. You could leave them out if you don't like mushrooms. I had no Cream of Chicken soup and sub'd Cream of Celery. It was soooooo goooood that I think I'll just stick with Celery in the future!!</li>

      <li>Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry; place in Crock-Pot. In a saucepan,combine remaining ingredients and heat until smooth and hot. Pour over chicken breasts. Cover and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours. (I did iton higher heat to speed things up. I added boiled potatoes and some paprika towards the end.) For the first time ever, I used those frozen boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to cook with canned soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this recipe, you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce. This is delish!!! Adapted by and edited for Mastercook by Brenda Adams adamsfmle@sprintmail.com&gt; Source: Rival Crock-Pot Cooking Posted mc-recipe, 8/14/96 and 7/9/97 NOTES : I think this could be made in oven or on top of stove. Hint: Rival's recipe called for 4 ounces of mushrooms, but I doubled the quantity. You could leave them out if you don't like mushrooms. I had no Cream of Chicken soup and sub'd Cream of Celery. It was soooooo goooood that I think I'll just stick with Celery in the future!!

      <li>Hi, all. I'm catching up on back digests and saw a recent interest in rutabagas. I found a great recipe in the January/97 issue of Vegetarian Times (page 49). Note: Roots get sweeter when they're cooked slowly. Preheat oven to 350. PAM a 2 qt. casserole dish (if necessary). Arrange veggies in dish. In small bowl combine sherry or broth, apple juice concentrate, honey or brown sugar, and lemon rind. Drizzle over root veggies. Cover with aluminum foil and bake till tender, about 40-50 minutes.

      <li>Pop popcorn and remove old maids. Spread popcorn in a large flat pan and preheat in a 250~ oven. In a saucepan, melt butter and stir in brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Stir constantly until the mixture comes to a boil, and continue to boil without stirring for about 5 minutes (240~). Remove from heat and add soda and vanilla, stirring until foamy. If nuts are used, add them now, stirring until heated through and no longer clumped. Pour syrup mixture over preheated popcorn and stir to coat. Bake for about 30 minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times to evenly distribute the coating. Bake longer, about 60 minutes, for a more Crackerjacks-like taste. Cool, break up and store airtight.

      <li>Maple syrup was used by the Ojibwa tribe for roasting wild game. Here it goes into a terrific side dish that includes squash, another Native American staple. Preheat oven to 350°F. Cook squash in large pot of boiling salted water until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well. Combine squash, apples and currants in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Season generously with nutmeg, salt and pepper. Combine maple syrup, butter and lemon juice in heavy small saucepan. Whisk over low heat until butter melts. Pour syrup over squash mixture and toss to coat evenly. Bake until squash and apples are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Cool 5 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with foil; chill. Rewarm covered in 350°F. oven about 30 minutes.) 12 Servings Bon Appétit November 1995 Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy &lt;sandysno@pctech.net&gt; on Mar 05, 1998</li>

      <li>1/4 pounds Butter</li>
      <li>Salt; to taste</li>
      <li>Cinnamon; to taste</li>
      <li>2 ounces Butter melted</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown sugar; Packed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1.Choose a squash with a thick neck and a short belly, as all the meat is in the neck. Split and seed it. Put it a glass pan with 1/4 inch of water, double cover it with saran, and microwave it fro 20 minutes, until it is tender. You can put in a covered pan with water in a 400 F oven and it will steam in about the same time or a little longer. When it is fork tender it is done. 2.Drain it and let it cool, and when you can handle it, the tan skin will scrape off with little trouble. Much easier than using a potato peeler when raw (which certainly works). 3.Mash it with butter season it with salt and cinnamon to taste, and put it into a buttered oven dish. A dash of dark rum contributes interest to the mix. Babancourt Haitian is what I use. 4.Drizzle the remaining butter over it, and sprinkle the top with brown sugar, using more or less to taste. You can also use Maple Syrup instead of brown sugar. You can also omit the sugar, or just put a little in with the mashed squash. 5.Bake at 350 F for about 30 minutes until a crust forms from the melted sugar. Serves 8 Serving Ideas: A festive dish. Under NO conditions put marshmallows in it. Notes: Take care in serving right from the oven.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Corn starch</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Water or dry white wine</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Prepared horseradish</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon White wine vinegar salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 Boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium size saucepan, heat milk over medium heat. Add corn starch dissolved in water or white wine and bring to a boil, stirring, until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in horseradish, yogurt, sugar, mustard, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken breasts in a casserole dish. Pour sauce over top and bake, covered, for 40-45 minutes. Horseradish cream sauce is also good on swordfish or shark, cooking time is only 20-30 minutes, depending on thickness of fish. Use skim milk and it's almost completely nonfat, with only about 8 grams of fat coming from the chicken breast.

Heat rice under hot tap water and place an equal amount in the center of each serving plate. Serve catfish Creole on top of white rice and garnish with chopped parsley. This dish may also be served over pasta. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp. Add chopped greens and fry a bit. Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then slice them into thick slices. Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cook a couple of minutes. Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot. Put the rice in the well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is done, about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste. NOTES: * A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got it from a friend. It's very easy to make. * I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless you put in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue. You should add enough to make the stew seem spicy to you. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking. : Precision: no need to measure. : Jeff Lichtman at rtech (Relational Technology, Inc.; Alameda, California) : Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent... : : {amdahl, sun}!rtech!jeff : {ucbvax, decvax}!mtxinu!rtech!jeff : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the heavy influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders are made from different proportions of spices, dried and ground. Spices can be dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low temperature oven, or on top of the stove in a dry skillet. If using a skillet be sure to shake the spices constantly so they don't burn. Grinding is usually done with a mortar and pestle. Curry powders are not necessarily hot, they are made that way by the addition of chili peppers. Dry spices, grind to a powder and bottle in a airtight container. Use 2 teas. to every 200 g or 1/2 lb vegetable.

Butter the bottom of a small glass, dip it in granulated sugar and mash the balls flat. Keep doing it. You need butter the glass bottom only once or twice but re-dip it in sugar for each ball. Then bake at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes. Let them sit just a bit before taking up from cookie sheet. ***** This is a Peg Bracken recipe and Peg stated "However, these are the best-tasting as well as the fastest, easiest and cheapest cookies I ever ran into and I wouldn't say such a thing unless I meant it. the community Mental Health Center at St. Lwarence Hospital in Lansing, Michigan, printed it, in the hope of channeling some energies away from throwing bricks, or snarling at Santa Claus. The more you knead, mash, squeeze and beat the bejunior out of the dough, the better you feel and the better the cookies taste.

    <category>Sauces</category>

    <ingredient>
      <li>6 Cloves of garlic, peeled</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Pine nuts</li>
      <li>3 Potatoes, boiled, peeled and</li>
      <li>1 Juice of a lemon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 Egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the garlic and nuts in a blender or food processor and puree. Add the potatoes, and puree. Pour potato mixture into a bowl and, using a whisk, beat in the lemon juice, a bit at a time. Gradually add the olive oil in a thin stream while continuing to beat so oil combines with potato mixture. When oil has been absorbed, add the egg and beat well. Giovanni de Bourbon-Sicily, French Vogue Note: If you omit the raw egg, you still get a nice sauce. According to an ancient proverb, "Garlic is as good as 10 mothers." If the latest flu bug has hit your house--and whose has escaped--you may be ready to test claims for garlic's medicinal powers. Since 1983, the National Library of Medicine has gathered 125 scientific papers on the therapeutic potential of garlic. They've found some interesting material. It's clear that allicin, the smelly compound in garlic, is an antibiotic--but only if taken raw. Heat destroys the elements that have antibiotic properties. Raw or cooked, garlic can also work as a decongestant and expectorant for common colds and bronchitis. Regularly eating raw garlic seems to act as a deterrent for these ailments, according to Dr Irwin Ziment. A Dr Abdullah, who eats a couple of raw garlic cloves a day, claims he has not had a cold since 1973. Admittedly, eating raw garlic won't help your social life but Kyolic, a deodorized garlic compound from Japan, may allow you to have good health and good friends. I've also heard of fresh garlic imported from Japan that supposedly is deodorized. If any of you have found it in local stores, let us know. It would be interesting to hear if it lives up to the claims made for it. Since having the flu is no fun, this may be a good time to take your chances and share some pungent garlic dishes with friends and family--for health's sake. It's easy to add minced fresh garlic to hummus or tabbouleh, Mid-Eastern dishes you can buy in many deli's and natural food stores. If you're brave, you can try my grandmother's cold cure. Spread a slice of black bread with butter, then layer thin slivers of raw garlic all over the bread. Eat this and it'll cure what ails you...or keep everyone so far away that no germs will reach you! Aioli is a milder way to enjoy raw garlic. This French condiment, a sort of mayonnaise, is a puree of garlic, boiled potatoes, olive oil and egg. Serve it with chicken, grilled fish, dolloped into soup and on vegetables. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>African Vegetable Stew</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Very large onion;chopped</li>
      <li>1 bunch Swiss chard</li>
      <li>1 can Garbanzo beans 500 g; (known also as chick peas, ceci, etc.)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins 75 g</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Uncooked rice 100 g</li>
      <li>Several fresh tomatoes; (or 1 large can 800 g of canned tomatoes)</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic; (or more to taste)</li>
      <li>2 Yams</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Tabasco sauce to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Fry onion, garlic, and white stems of chard until barely limp. Add chopped greens and fry a bit. Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then slice them into thick slices. Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Cook a couple of minutes. Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot. Put the rice in the well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is done\(emabout 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste. I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless you put in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue. You should add enough to make the stew seem spicy to you. Difficulty: easy. Time: 15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking. Precision: no need to measure. Posted to recipelu-digest by jecraig@lan-inc.com on Feb 9, 98</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>According to NBC sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, men and women behave very differently in the kitchen. "When men cook, it usually looks like a disaster area," says the former Minnesota Viking. "And there's no rhyme or reason to what they make. My father sometimes cooked chicken for breakfast. And when he cooked, everything came out six times bigger than when Mom cooked." Rashad's father prepared banana pancakes for him when he was a little boy, back in Tacoma, Washington. Washad, in turn, makes them for his 5-year-old daughter, Condola Phylea. On Super Bowl Sunday, he promises, she'll be starting off her day with a short stack. 1. In a mixing bowl, using a hand or electric mixer, beat eggs for 2 minutes until frothy. Add flour, baking powder, milk and oil. Stir in bananas. 2. On a hot griddle, pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until edges become dry, about 2 minues per side. Top with banana slices. Drizzle with honey or maple syrup and sprinkle with pecans. Posted to EAT-L Digest by Al &amp; Diane Johnson &lt;johnson@NEGIA.NET&gt; on Sep 18, 1997</li>

      <li>The tangy tingling sensation it causes after being splashed on is one way to describe an after shave. Most after shaves act as astringents; they help firm skin tone and close skin pores when applied immediately after shaving. Many after shaves contain alcohol, which possesses antibacterial abilities, helping to prevent infections of nicks or shaving cuts. It also should contain glycerine and/or other ingredients known to be beneficial to skin care. Glycerine will help counter the drying effects on the skin, and the chafing and irritation that can develop with dry skin. *Most drug stores contain all of the above tinctures and oils. Herb and health food shops carry the essential oils. Posted to bbq-digest V5 #735 by RockMc &lt;RockMc@aol.com&gt; on Dec 1, 1997</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The light and moist cupcakes have a delicate cinnamon-scented chocolate glaze that's spread over them while they are still warm. 1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line twelve 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with paper liners. 2. Place cocoa in a small bowl and stir in 1/2 cup very hot tap water to dissolve. 3. In a large bowl combine the melted butter and sugar; beat with an electric mixer until blended. Add the egg and beat until light, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cocoa mixture and beat until smooth. In a small bowl stir together the sour cream and baking soda. Stir this mixture into the butter-sugar mixture. Add the flour and vanilla; beat quickly, just until evenly blended. With a spoon stir in the coconut. Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, dividing it evenly among them; they will be about three-quarters full. Bake about 20 minutes, until the tops spring back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the tea cakes from the pan and cool slightly on a rack while you prepare the glaze. 4. Spread about 2 teaspoons of the chocolate glaze on each of the warm tea cakes and let cool thoroughly. Chocolate Glaze: Makes 1/2 cup Drizzle this simple and tasty glaze over the afternoon tea cakes or over any cake that's been frosted with seven-minute caramel frosting. 1. In a small saucepan combine the butter with 2 tablespoons water. Place over low heat, add the chocolate, and stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture thickens slightly; remove from the heat. 2. In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar and cinnamon; stir in the chocolate mixture and the vanilla to make a smooth glaze. From: Jim Fobel's Old-Fashioned Baking Book.

      <li>The three of us love this pickled beet recipe from Farm House Cookbook. 1. Trim beet stems, leaving 1/2 inch of stem intact. Do not trim roots. 2. Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer. Add beets, cover, and steam until nearly tender but still offer resistance when tested with a sharp knife about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove steamer basket from heat. 3. While beets are steaming, combine vinegar, sugar, spices, and herbs in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower heat and keep warm. 4. When beets are cool enough to handle, carefully scrape off the skin, trim the stem and root ends. Slice the beets into 1/8 inch thick slices and place in glass bowl. Cover with warm vinegar mix and set aside to cool. When cool, cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before using. They will keep for about 3 weeks.

      <li>Barbara Mihalevich Arciero, Food Writer, "The Times", Shreveport, Louisiana. "When I was a student at the University of Missouri, I spent a semester working in a preschool. That's where I discovered Aggression Cookies, a not-so-unique cookie with a unique name. These cookies, I discovered, offer a socially acceptable way for youngsters to let off steam and to make a tasty snack at the same time. The dough is stiff, so children can mash, knead, squeeze and pound it to their hearts' content without inflicting any damage. Children don't need to know the name of these cookies; just tell them you've got a special cookie for them to make." Combine brown sugar, butter, oats, baking soda and flour in a large mixing bowl. Mash, knead, squeeze and pound ingredients to make a dough. Form dough into small balls. Put balls on ungreased baking sheets. Grease the bottom of a small glass or jar; dip into granulated sugar and use to flatten balls. Bake in a preheated 350 deg oven about 15 minutes or until done. Transfer to racks to cool. Makes about 7 dozen cookies. Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #462 by "Pollywog" &lt;hlewis@cci-29palms.com&gt; on Dec 20, 1997</li>

Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a small glass and dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat. Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe to use when you need to get rid of some agressions because the dough is too heavy for most mixers. So you have to use your hands and beat it!! You can also use peanut butter or butterscotch chips or a mixture of them.

      <li>2 cups Milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Shortening</li>

      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pepper to taste Make a batter of the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, shortening (the oil from the baking fowl is generally used) and milk. Bake in a hot oven (400) until done, about half an hour. Then crumble the bread, add one medium sized onion, chopped fine, pepper and a little more salt. Break in the two eggs and wet with the juice from the baking chicken or turkey. The liver chopped fine and added to the dressing improves it, as does the addition of hard cooked egg. After mixing thoroughly, put the mixture on one side of the baking dish and roast with the fowl until brown. When basting the fowl, baste the dressing also to keep it moist and to improve the flavor. This amount will serve 12 persons. From: 200 years of Charleston Cooking 1930 Shared By: Pat Stockett From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Gypsum</li>
      <li>3 1/2 pounds Pale dry extract</li>

      <li>1 ounce Willamette hops (boil)</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Irish moss</li>
      <li>1 ounce Clusters hops pellets</li>
      <li>Red Star ale yeast</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mash pale malt, crystal malt, and gypsum in 2-3/4 gallons of 170 degree water; this should give initial heat of 155 degrees (pH 5.0). Maintain temperature at 140-155 degrees for 2 hours. Sparge. To wort, add extract and brown sugar. Boil with Willamette hops. After 15 minutes add Hallertauer and Irish moss. Dry hop with clusters and steep. When cool, add wort to carboy and pitch yeast. The posted recipe called for 4 pounds of dry extract with 2 cups re- served for priming. This seemed excessive and a good way to get explod- ing bottles, so we reduced the amount of extract to 3-1/2 pounds and assumed that standard priming techniques would be used, maybe replacing corn sugar with 3/4 to 1 cup of malt extract. --- Ed. Notice that I screwed up the hops: Clusters are for bittering, and Willamette (or Fuggles) for aromatic.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the prosciutto and pancetta into small pieces and remove the casing from the sausages. Using a meat grinder, grind together the prosciutto, pancetta, and sausages. Place the ground meat in a crockery or glass bowl, add the butter and eggs, and mix very well with a wooden spoon until the butter is completely incorporated. Add the bread crumbs and Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using. When ready, bring the broth to a boil in a large pot over medium heat. Meanwhile, place a large skillet with the butter over low heat. When the broth reaches a boil, start shaping the meat mixture into tiny meat balls; a heaping tablespoon of mixture will be enough to prepare several. Make sure the meat balls are solid with no holes inside. Drop the balls into the boiling broth a few at a time, and as they rise to the top, tansfer them with a slotted spoon to the skillet containing the butter. When all the meat balls are cooked and in the skillet, add the mascarpone and heavy cream. Mix very well and simmer for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the mascarpone is completely dissolved. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix very well, then transfer to a warmed serving platter. Serve immediately, with some Parmesan on the side.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 tablespoons Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>1 cup All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Hot water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Shredded coconut</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sour cream</li>
      <li>Glaze:</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Sifted confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 ounces Unsweetened chocolate</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The light and moist cupcakes have a delicate cinnamon-scented chocolate glaze that's spread over them while they are still warm. 1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line twelve 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with paper liners. 2. Place cocoa in a small bowl and stir in 1/2 cup very hot tap water to dissolve. 3. In a large bowl combine the melted butter and sugar; beat with an electric mixer until blended. Add the egg and beat until light, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cocoa mixture and beat until smooth. In a small bowl stir together the sour cream and baking soda. Stir this mixture into the butter-sugar mixture. Add the flour and vanilla; beat quickly, just until evenly blended. With a spoon stir in the coconut. Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, dividing it evenly among them; they will be about three-quarters full. Bake about 20 minutes, until the tops spring back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the tea cakes from the pan and cool slightly on a rack while you prepare the glaze. 4. Spread about 2 teaspoons of the chocolate glaze on each of the warm tea cakes and let cool thoroughly. Chocolate Glaze: Makes 1/2 cup Drizzle this simple and tasty glaze over the afternoon tea cakes or over any cake that's been frosted with seven-minute caramel frosting. 1. In a small saucepan combine the butter with 2 tablespoons water. Place over low heat, add the chocolate, and stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture thickens slightly; remove from the heat. 2. In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar and cinnamon; stir in the chocolate mixture and the vanilla to make a smooth glaze. From: Jim Fobel's Old-Fashioned Baking Book.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CHEAPER AND BETTER</li>
      <li>1 cup Baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Ammonia</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon SCENT OF YOUR CHOICE: perfume, lemon extract or juice, VANILLA BEAN EXTRACT or pine oil</li>
      <li>16 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>** For a quick fix for a stubborn odor, here's a traditional solution that you can customize to your taste. Into a clean gallon size plastic jug pour baking soda, ammonia, and the scent of your choice. Slowly fill with warm water. Label and cap jug. Keep out of the reach of children. Pour small quantities of the solution into pretty containers with spray tops--old perfune containers or atomizers are ideal. Then you can leave the refresher on the counter in rooms where you need it frequently. To Use: Simply mist the air where unpleasant odors abound. Avoid spraying on or near furniture or pets. Wipe up any reside if you overdo, but the mist will not harm anything if you don't soak an item with the mist. Especially AVOID spraying directly on FINE WOOD FURNITURE--The ammonia, scent, or water could harm the finish. 1 gal. Big savings.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 cups Unbleached white flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold, sweet butter</li>
      <li>2 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Honey</li>
      <li>1 cup Buttermilk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes 1 large loaf. Preheat oven to 350F. Sift the flour, baking powder, soda and salt into a large mixing bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add. Cut it into the flour with a pastry blender until the mixture is the size of peas. Add the raisins and toss to distribute evenly, using two forks. Beat the egg in another bowl until very frothy. Beat in the honey. When it is well blended, beat in the buttermilk. Gradually pour the liquids into the flour, tossing all the while with a fork so the mixture gets evenly moistened. Continue tossing lightly with two forks until the batter comes together; it doesn't have to be completely mixed and should be very rough and lumpy. Butter a heavy skillet or casserole, 10 to 11 inches in diameter and 2 to 3 inches deep. Round is the traditional shape. Spoon batter out into the pan and push it gently to fill the pan. It can mound up somewhat in the middle. Bake at 350 F about an hour or until the middle is set. Cut out a piece to test if necessary. Cut into wedges and serve warm from the pan.

Aggression Cookies -- (the post-modern Asian American performance poem) NOTE: With thick Chinese meat cleaver, hack chocolate and macadamia nuts to pieces. ALSO, You may substitute chocolate and white chocolate chips for the bars if you are not feeling particularly angst-ridden. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, thrash butter and sugars until uniform. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Add flour and baking soda; whip until smooth. Toss in chocolate chunks and nuts. To avoid the "chocolate chip cookie cooked under a steam roller" look, refrigerate the cookie dough for a couple of hours before baking. Throw batter by tablespoons full onto an ungreased baking sheet--aim so that the cookies land 2 inches apart. Bake until golden, about 10-12 minutes. Using a spatula, pry the cookies loose from the baking sheet, and allow them to vent on wire racks. Makes about 4 dozen cookies. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /COOKIES From rec.food.cooking archives.

This is a good recipe to use when you need to get rid of some agressions because the dough is too heavy for most mixers. So you have to use your hands and beat it!!

Place dry ingredients and butter in food processor fitted with a pastry blade and run machine for 1 minute, or until butter is cut up and mixture feels sandy. Add eggs and run machine in quick spurts for 2 minutes, or until dough forms a compact ball. 2. Cut dough into 4-5 small pieces. Lightly flour each and roll it through pasta machine (set rollers at widest gap). When dough is smooth, reduce gap between rollers and roll the dough again. Continue in this fashion until rollers are at their narrowest setting. As dough sheets come out, dust them lightly with flour and spread them out on the table. 3. Prepare filling. Steam spinach for 30 seconds or until tender, rinse it under cold water, and squeeze it tightly to extract all the water. Place the spinach and remaining ingredients for filling in food processor and grind until smooth. (See part 2 for more) From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <category>Pasta</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Flour</li>
      <li>6 ounces Sweet cream butter</li>
      <li>8 Eggs</li>
      <li>3 Pinches salt; to taste</li>
      <li>15 ounces Ricotta cheese; dry as possible</li>
      <li>2 ounces Spinach; trimmed,washed</li>
      <li>13 ounces Parmesan cheese; grated</li>
      <li>1 pinch Black pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>2 Pinches nutmeg; to taste</li>
      <li>1 quart Heavy cream</li>
      <li>4 ounces Mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>2 Pinches white pepper; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>STEP ONE: The Dough-- Combine the following ingredients: 1 pound bleached flour, 2 ounces sweet butter, 5 eggs, and 1 pinch salt. Work the dough long enough to allow the butter to be incorporated inside the dough. Wrap the dough in a towel and let it rest, for at least one hour, inside the refrigerator. STEP TWO: The Filling-- For the filling, steam the spinach and chop it very fine. In a bowl, beat together 2 eggs with 7 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 1 pinch each: salt, black pepper, and nutmeg. Add 15 ounces dry ricotta cheese and mix very well, but not too long. If you mix it too much, the mixture will become liquid. STEP THREE: The Agnolotti-- Roll out the dough in a thin layer and brush it with an egg wash (made from 1 egg). With the help of a teaspoon to make a "walnut" shape, place the spoon on the dough and cover it with another layer. Cut with a round pasta cutter 2 inches in diameter. Stuff the pasta with the filling and cook in boiling water until the agnolotti come to the surface of the boiling water. STEP FOUR: The Sauce-- For the sauce, bring 1 quart heavy cream to a slow boil and add 4 ounces sweet butter, 6 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 4 ounces mascarpone cheese, 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of nutmeg, 2 pinches white pepper. Boil slowly for five minutes, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon. Serve agnolotti on warm plates with warm sauce. Recipe by: Chef Roberto Donna of Galileo Ristorante, Washington, D.C.

    <title>Aglio Olio Peperoncino</title>
    <category>Sauce</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Head garlic (whole head; not 1 clove) (up to)</li>
      <li>7 Jalapeno chiles</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cheap olive oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Aglio Olio Peperoncino (garlic oil with peppers) I offer a simple recipe which I have cooked about once a week for the last 12 years. It's a derivative of the Italian "Aglio Olio Peperoncino," garlic oil with peppers. &lt;Eileen&gt; ebanderson@ualr.edu Put pasta water on to boil. Peel and slice the cloves of one head of garlic. Slice 5-7 jalapenos into rounds. I leave the seeds in. Saute the garlic and peppers in about 1/2 cup of cheap olive oil (NOT extra- virgin; it can't take the heat). Saute to preference: practically raw, soft, or garlic turning golden. If you like the latter, give the garlic a head start on the peppers. Boil 1 lb dry pasta: spaghetti is traditional but shells or penne are good too. Start grating lots of Parmesan cheese. You know the rest: drain the pasta well, mix the pasta and oil mixture, pile on the cheese, eat. Hard-core heads will want to use habs, probably. I've had good results with serranos and tiny Asian peppers. Just don't used dried; the dish needs the sweetness of fresh peppers, IMO. Note to the purists: this is a bastardization. Italians don't generally put Parmesan cheese on aglio olio, and would probably not cook with these types of hot peppers. Too bad. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 pounds Cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Fennel</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Dry red chiles</li>
      <li>small Piece</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the heavy influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders are made from different proportions of spices, dried and ground. Spices can be dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low temperature oven, or on top of the stove in a dry skillet. If using a skillet be sure to shake the spices constantly so they don't burn. Grinding is usually done with a mortar and pestle. Curry powders are not necessarily hot, they are made that way by the addition of chili peppers. Dry spices, grind to a powder and seal in an airtight container. Use 2 teaspoons of curry powder to every 400 g or 1 lb of fish.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Sun, 14 Apr 1996 16:48:42 -0400 From: Wendy Lockman &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt; Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp. Add chopped greens and fry a bit. Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then slice them into thick slices. Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cook a couple of minutes. Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot. Put the rice in the well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is done, about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste. NOTES: A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got it from a friend. It's very easy to make. I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless you put in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue. You should add enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.

    <recipetext>
      <li>The classic Greek sauce, avgolemono, is a great low-fat alternative to the melted butter, mayonnaise or vinaigrette dipping sauces usually served with artichokes. Snap the stems off four large artichokes and trim the bases so that they will sit upright on a plate. Boil a potful of water to which you have added the juice of a lemon and a pinch of salt. Drop the artichokes in and boil for 30 minutes or until they are tender. Test by pulling off an outer leaf and trying the flesh at the base for tenderness. Meanwhile, in another saucepan, bring a cup of chicken stock to the boil. In a cup, mix about two-thirds of a tablespoon of cornflour with a little water until it is smooth and add to the boiling stock, stirring until it thickens. Separate 3 eggs, beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks, then add the yolks and continue beating tin the whole mass is fluffy. Still beating, add the juice of a lemon and pour in the boiling stock. Pour this mixture back into the stock saucepan, and stir it over a low heat for a couple of minutes. It must not boil. Place the artichokes in the centre of warmed plates and pour the avgolemono over them. Serve. Makes 4 servings. From "Raw Materials" by Meryl Constance, The Syndey Morning Herald, 10/13/92.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat ghee or vegetable oil with the whole cloves over low heat. When hot, add the onions &amp; garlic &amp; saute, stirring occasionally, for a few moments. Add the carrots &amp; potatoes &amp; continue to saute for 5 minutes, stir to prevent sticking. Add the green beans &amp; saute for just a few more minutes. Slowly stir in the coconut milk. Use only as much as you need to create a thick sauce: the vegetables should not be swimming in milk. Carefully bring to a boil, reduce heat &amp; simmer until the vegetables are cooked, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally otherwise the milk &amp; vegetables will burn. Garnish with cilantro. Serve with an Ethiopian Lentil stew or with an Indian dal to mix cuisines, &amp; bread. If you prefer the vegetables to be hotter, add more berbere. It is best if this dish is made ahead of time &amp; then left to let the flavours marry. In place of cilantro, use fresh parsley.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic, mashed to a paste with salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Have all the ingredients at room temperature. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with the mustard, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and garlic to taste. Beat in 1/4 cup vegetable oil, drop by drop. This will establish the emulsion. The remaining vegetable oil and the extra virgin olive oil can then be added in a slow steady stream while you continue to beat constantly. Adjust seasoning with lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. If the mayonnaise seems too thick, add a drop or two of water. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
