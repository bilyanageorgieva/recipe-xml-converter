    <title>Banana Crunch Cake</title>
    <category>Cakes</category>
    <quantity>10</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE TOPPING</li>
      <li>1 cup Dried Banana Chips; unsalted but sweeten</li>
      <li>1 ounce Unsalted Butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Light Brown Sugar; (packed)</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Pecans; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE BANANA CAKE</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour; unbleached</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon</li>
      <li>3 ounces Unsalted Butter; softened *</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dark Rum</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Baking Soda</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sour Cream</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Mashed Bananas; (about 3)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* plus extra for pan. For the topping: Put the banana chips between 2 pieces of wax paper and crush them into approximately 1/2-inch pieces with a rolling pin or the flat side of a meat pounder. You should have about 3/4 cup banana chips pieces. Melt the butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the banana chips and chopped pecans until they are well coated with the brown sugar mixture. Set aside. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 2-inch deep, 9-inch layer pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment or wax paper and butter the paper. For the cake: Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon together. Set aside. Put the 6 tablespoons softened butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer and beat on medium speed 15 seconds. Slowly add the sugar and beat 2 minutes. The mixture will be thick. Add the eggs and beat for 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl's sides down once during this beating. Add the vanilla and rum. Gently stir the baking soda into the sour cream. Stir the sour cream mixture into the mashed bananas. The banana mixture will be lumpy. Decrease the mixer's speed to low and add the flour mixture and the banana mixture alternately, beginning and ending with the flour mixture (3 additions of flour, 2 of banana). Stop mixing as soon as the last addition of flour is incorporated. Spread half the batter in the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the topping evenly over the batter. Spread the remaining batter evenly over the topping. Sprinkle the remaining banana crunch topping evenly over the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire cooling rack for about 2 hours. Use a small sharp knife to loosen the sides of the cake from the pan. Place a flat plate on top of the cake and invert the cake onto the plate. Carefully remove and discard the paper liner. Place another flat plate or a moisture-resistant cardboard cake circle on the bottom of the cake and invert the cake. The cake is now right-side up. Replace any of the topping that may have fallen off the top. To freeze: Wrap the cooled cake tightly with plastic wrap then heavy aluminum foil. Label with date and contents. Freeze up to 3 months. Serves 10.</li>

      <li>From: kathr@comm.mot.com Date: 30 Mar 1994 10:18:24 -0500 From the Chicago Tribune Food Guide, June 20, '91 1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9" x 5" x 3" loaf pan. 2. Cream the sugar and butter with an electric mixer until light. Add the eggs and mix well. On low speed, mix in the bananas, milk, and vanilla. Stop the mixer and add the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix until just combined, then stir in the mini chocolate chips and nuts. 3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan 5 minutes; turn onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. NOTE: Mini chocolate chips work better than regular chips because the regular size ones tend to sink to the bottom of the loaf during baking. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

Filling: Pour water into small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 10 minutes to soften. Pour milk into medium saucepan. Scrape seed from vanilla bean into milk; add bean. Bring to simmer. Whisk yolks, sugar, and cornstarch in medium bowl until thick. Gradually whisk in hot milk. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium heat until mixture just begins to boil and thicken, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes. Add softened gelatin and stir to dissolve. Strain mixture into medium bowl. Press plastic wrap onto surface of pastry cream and chill until cool, about 30 minutes. Using electric mixer, beat cream and powdered sugar in a large bowl to stiff peaks. Carefully fold 1 1/2 c whipped cream into pastry cream. Fold in bananas. Spoon mixture into crust. Spoon remaining whipped cream into pastry bag with medium star tip. Pipe whipped cream over filling, covering completely. Chill until set, at least 3 hours and up to 6 hours.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer or deep heavy skillet. Time heating so it will be ready when you are prepared to begin frying doughnuts. Use Canola oil if you prefer, but peanut oil has a higher smoking point and is a good choice for frying. 2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cut in margarine using a pastry blender or two knives. 3. Make a well in center of mix and add mashed bananas and eggs. Mix well. You can do this with a wooden spoon, or since dough will be very stiff you may want to use your hands to mix it well. 4. Place dough on a lightly floured surface and roll to 1/2-inch thick. Cut with a 2-1/2 inch doughnut cutter that you dip in flour as needed. 5. Deep-fry, a few at a time, until golden brown. Drain on brown paper bags. Fry the doughnut "holes" also. 6. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a paper bag or place on a shallow plate. Coat warm doughnuts with this mixture. Yield: about 22 doughnuts and 22 centers.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter or</li>
      <li>Margarine, softened</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Warm water</li>
      <li>2/3 cups (1 large) mashed banana</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"These flavorful crackers are an obvious choice for a breakfast snack. A wonderful fruit cobbler crust can be made by finely crumbling these crackers, moistening them with melted butter, and pressing them into a baking dish. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. Combine the flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl or in the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the banana and blend well. In a separate bowl, dissolve the honey in the warm water. Slowly add the sweetened water to the flour-banana mixture and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, at most 1/8 inch. With a cookie cutter or a small glass, cut into 2- to 2-1/2-inch circles. Arrange the circles on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turning over once during baking. These crackers should be medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 60-70. VARIATION: Substitute 1-1/2 cups rice flour for an equal amount of the all-purpose flour.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 large Eggplants, unpeeled, diced</li>
      <li>2 large Tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>2 large Onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Oil (or clarified butter)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until it is translucent. Add the spices and stir for 1 minute. Add the eggplant and tomato, stir well and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are mushy (about 1/2 hour). Remove the lid and continue cooking until most of the liquid evaporates (about 15 minutes). The finished dish should be thick enough that you could use it as a dip. NOTES: * Indian eggplant, onion and tomato casserole -- This is an Indian dish, called Baigan Bartha in Hindi. We make it a lot and call it "Bangin' Bart." It is eggplant, onions and tomatoes, but not in the usual way. In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked to mush, with only a small amount of tomato, just enough to flavor it. Yield: serves 6-8. * I don't make this with any spices but salt and pepper. The genuine Indian version of the recipe adds various Indian spices; try about 1 t of fresh ginger, about 1/2 t of turmeric, about 1/2 t of cayenne, and about 1 t of garam masala for a more authentic Indian flavor. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking. : Precision: no need to measure. : Richard Newman-Wolfe : University of Rochester, Rochester NY : Nemo@Rochester.ARPA : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Adapted from The Joslin Diabetes Gourmet Cookbook, 1993 which used 1 large egg white plus 6 tbsp. egg substitute, 1/8 tsp almond extract, orange juice concentrate, 2 cups unbleached flour and no orange peel. Original nutritional info. 1/18 recipe = 1 bread, 1 fat Joslin Exchanges 122 calories, 2 grams protein, 14 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams fat (44% of calories), trace cholesterol, 61 mg sodium, 105 mg potassium. Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with waxed paper and spray with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine bananas, oil, beaten egg, juice concentrate and orange peel. Stir dry ingredients together and then stir them into banana mixture until just blended. Spread the batter in the pan and bake for 45 minutes or until the top is lightly browned. Cool in a pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Slice the first sample while the loaf is still warm. Comment in the original recipe states that the well-wrapped loaf keeps in the refrigerator and freezes well. Slice is smaller than a slice of regular bread (about half size). Tested with changes noted by Elizabeth Rodier, Jan 1994. To cut down on cholesterol use 1 whole egg and 2 whites, or home made egg substitute. When comparing bread recipes, consider serving size as well as calories. Does the serving taste good alone or would I add 1 tsp margarine (1 fat)? 1 tb peanut butter would add 1 fat exchange + 1 meat or 95 calories, 3 grams carb. 4 grams protein, 8.2 grams fat, 98 mg sodium 1 tb regular strawberry jam made of equal parts fruit and sugar would add 54 calories, 14 grams carbohydrate or 1 fruit exchange File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/diabetic.zip</li>

      <li>"In Bangladesh, cabbage is usually available in the market during the winter season, as are tomatoes, peas and carrots. So this dish appears quite frequently at Bengali dinner tables during the winter. In the markets where such vegetables are available year round, banda is a popular standard." Meghna Guharthakurta, Dhaka, Bangladesh Start by heating the oil in a heavy pan and put in the tumeric and some salt. Fry for a few seconds and then add the cubed potatoes, turning frequently so that they turn yellow from the tumeric. Cook them for 5-10 minutes (they will complete their cooking later) and remove them from the oil and set aside. Adding more oil if necessary, now saute the onion slices until they are soft and transparent. Then add the bay leaf, cumin, ginger and chili powder. Stir well and put in the tomatoes. When they have begun to break down, add the cabbage bit by bit, stirring it in well so that it is sauteed in the spices. Cover and cook gently for 3-5 minutes. Finally put in the peas and semi-fried potatoes and seasoning.Mix well, replace the cover and continue to cook for 5-10 minutes or until potatoes are ready.

This cake is quite sweet and doesn't need frosting. PS: to make sour milk (don't use old milk), put a tablespoon of vinegar in a cup of milk) REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CAKES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Sorry I haven't responded earlier. This is in response to your question about making the Banana Split Salad for diabetics. My sister is diabetic and she has made this so she can eat it. If you think this needs to be sweeter you can add Equal or another sweetener. My sister never adds the sweetener as she says that it is sweet enough. By the way, I loved your idea of adding the crushed pineapple. I'll try it the next time I make this salad. Hope this helps! If you have any other questions about it let me know. I've also sent the regular version too for anyone who may have missed and wants it. Note 1: my sister washes and drains them so she can eat them as there isn't really a substitute -- her nutritionist gave the ok. Mix together lemon juice, sour cream, and Cool Whip. Add cherries, bananas, and nuts. Mix well. Place in Cool Whip containers and freeze. Thaw slightly before serving.

      <li>Hello Everyone! I'm new to the list (as of yesterday) so I don't know all of the in's and out's of the list but I have noticed that the recipes today have been low fat. So I'm sharing with you a "recipe" I got off of Party at Home on HGTV yesterday. Its not really so much of a recipe but here goes..... Peel the bananas and slice. Place slices in freezer bag and freeze. Once frozen, put in food processor and process until creamy. That's it! You would not believe how close the consistency is to ice cream. My husband kept asking me what was in it and wouldn't believe that it was just bananas. I went back and added a dash of cinnamon and that was good too.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Follow manufacturer instructions for ingredient placement. Use regular white bread cycle. Initially dough may be too wet so add more flour gradually to achieve a soft pliable dough ball. Add nuts during the last kneading cycle. Note: you could add a bit of cinnamon or a tsp of banana extract. I havent tried brown sugar to replace white sugar, could be possibility. Make sure bananas are ripe for best flavor. Let bread cool completely for best slicing.

      <li>I want to thank Debbie and Stephanie for tracking down this recipe by way of numerous requests to the Epicurious web site. I'm sharing with you for Gourmet Friday. Bon Appetit, March 1993 Caramel: In heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar and water ; stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat, and bring to boil. Cook without stirring until caramel is deep amber color, brushing down any crystals that form on sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling occasionally, about 10 mins. Remove from heat; carefully add cream. (Mixture will bubble vigorously.) Return to low heat, and whisk until smooth. Add butter and salt, and whisk until smooth. Cool to room temperature. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover, and chill. Before using, warm over low heat until just pourable.) For Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter three 9-inch diameter cake pans with 1-1/2 inch high sides. Line bottoms of pans with parchment or waxed paper; butter paper. In heavy large saucepan, combine chocolate and butter. Stir over low heat until melted. Cool. Whisk in eggs and sugar. Stir in flour, vanilla, and salt. Divide batter among prepared pans, and spread evenly. Sprinkle 3/4 cup pecans atop each. Bake cakes until set and tester inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs still attached, about 15 mins. Cool in pans on rack. Turn out layers, and remove waxed paper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store airtight.) Topping: Beat whipping cream and liqueur to stiff peaks. Place 1 cake layer pecan side up on platter. Drizzle 1/4 cup caramel over. Cover with layer of bananas. Spread 1 cup whipped cream over bananas. Drizzle 3 tablespoons caramel over cream. Top with second cake layer. Repeat layering with 1/4 cup caramel, bananas, 1 cup whipped cream, and 3 tablespoons caramel. Top with remaining cake layer. Drizzle 1/4 cup caramel over cake. Transfer remaining whipped cream to pastry bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe rosettes of cream around top edge of torte. Garnish with bananas. Sprinkle with pecans. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Chill.) Rewarm remaining caramel. Serve torte with caramel. Posted to TNT Recipes Digest by fluffduff@juno.com (Hope Blackford) on Mar 06, 1998</li>

You could use all white flour instead of wheat if you like. I add the walnuts at the beginning with other ingred. It seems to mix better. You can also add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon if you like. We like it better without.

Divide onion over sausages and then pour gravy over all. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and heat under broiler for a few minutes to brown. Note: to serve in one casserole, use a 6-cup casserole and proceed as with individual serving dishes.

    <title>Barbra's Best Chicken Soup! Pt 2</title>
    <category>None</category>

    <ingredient>
      <li>See part 1</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>again add salt at this point. [I swear.. I rarely ever cook with salt, but it is a must here]. On your first try don't get too heavy handed [even though there are tricks to fixing it if it is too salty]. Cover the pot [completely] and simmer for 45 minutes. Turn off stove. Remove cover and allow to cool. Now if you want just a clear broth: Dump the contents of the pot through a strainer into another pot. I then press down on the chicken, greens and onions in the strainer to release some very tasty juices that are hiding. I then throw all the things in the strainer out. If you want chicken soup: Using a slotted spoon [don't use your hand as the oil in the pot is hotter than you can imagine - speaking of which be VERY careful when dumping the soup into the strainer. I have burned my hand on many an occasion!] and remove the carrots to a separate place. Take out the chicken as well. When you start to strain the soup you are going to have to pick out the pieces of celery. Cut the chicken into chunks, slice the carrots and add the celery. I keep this is a separate container from the soup in the fridge [people like to eat the onions and the greens as well.] Now you need to find containers to put the soup into. You want to use containers that do not have a very large mouth. The reason for this is that the fat will congeal and you need to remove it. If the opening is not too big then the fat will congeal in a thick piece and is easier to remove then if it is a very wide mouth container [do not use a container too small to be able to remove the fat]. After pouring the broth into containers refrigerate. You will need to let the soup at least overnight [maybe longer] until all the fat has risen to the top and has formed a hard solid piece. Remove the fat and discard [or you can save it for some very yummy but unhealthy recipes I have - also if you plan to make balls the chicken soup fat is a must!]. What *I* do at this point is pour the soup through a funnel into empty plastic Evian® water bottles. Fill one inch from top and freeze. It seems to last forever and is just as good when defrosted [you can also nuke the frozen soup for ten minutes which will give you enough liquid for a couple of servings]. And that my dear friend is how to make the BEST chicken soup. Now you need to decide what to do with it. Soup noodles satisfy me just fine [if you make extra - again keep this in a separate container from the soup]. You can make balls and other endless possibilities. NOTES : *SECRET NOTE: I always believed the most flavor in the soup came from the fat/skin on the chicken. Over the years I have learned that not to be the case! So, now what you do is strain the soup. Keep all chicken, bones, and feet. Return them to the pot and start a second batch of soup adding to the leftovers from the first batch. It is so good I promise everyone you serve it to will swear it is the best they ever had!!!

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>4 Stalks celery</li>
      <li>1 large Carrot</li>
      <li>3 cups Barley</li>
      <li>6 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sea salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried basil</li>
      <li>2 Bay leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped Italian parsley for garnish</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SHITAKE MUSHROOM SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 3/4 ounces Dried shitake mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>4 large Shallots or cloves garlic; peeled and minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Soy sauce or tamari; (I used only 1, plenty salty)</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Kuzu; (or cornstarch)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Whole-grain mustard; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Made this the other day, we liked it! The sauce would be good on other things as well. Both recipes are from _The Natural Gourmet_ by Annemarie Colbin. 24 - 30 croquettes Wash and dice the celery and carrot and place in a pressure cooker (or a 4 quart sauce pan) along with the barley, water , salt, and a few grindings of pepper, basil, and bay leaves. Bring to pressure (or a boil) over high heat, then reduce heat to low and pressure cook for 40 minutes (or simmer, covered, for 1 hour), or until the barley is tender. Wash and chop the parsley. When barley is finished cooking and the pressure is down, remove the bay leaves. Place half grain in a food processor and process until well mixed but not pureed. Combine with the remaining grain in a large bowl and set aside until cool enough to handle. Moisten your fingers with water and form barley into 2 1/2 inch round croquettes or patties. Fry in non stick skillet sprayed very lightly with cooking spray. Alternatively, brush with oil and place on oiled baking sheets and bake for 1 hour, or until lightly browned. Serve hot with Shitake Mushroom sauce, garnished with chopped parsley. Shitake Mushroom Sauce - 2 cups: Place mushrooms in small bowl. Bring 1 cup water to boil, pour over the mushrooms and set aside to soak until soft, about 30 minutes. Drain mushrooms and press out excess liquid, reserving the soaking water. Cut off tough stems and discard. Slice mushrooms into thin strips. Place 2 - 3 tablespoons soaking water in a small saucepan along with the shallots or garlic and 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce. Simmer, stirring until the shallots are tender, about 3 - 5 minutes, adding more liquid if necessary. Add the mushrooms and simmer for 1 minute more. Add the remaining soaking water, 1 1/4 cups additional water, the soy sauce and lemon juice. Dissolve the kuzu or cornstarch in remaining 1 cup water. Bring sauce to a simmer, add the kuzu and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and translucent. Add mustard if you wish. Serve hot.

      <li>In response to the person requesting barley soup recipes: I saw this today on the Ask Dr. Weil website at www.drweil.com. It called for 2 tablespoons olive oil which I substituted with broth or wine to saute the veggies in (or a slight nonstick oil spray ). I would probably use a pretty flavorful veggie stock since the seasoning in this recipe is minimal... Barley has been cultivated since the Stone Age and has been fermented to make beer since not long after that. Like other cereal grains -- wheat, millet, oats, corn and rye -- barley is a great source of fiber and carbohydrates, and can also be used to make cereal, bread and soup. Folk medicine uses barley in barley water, made by simply soaking barley in water, which is reputed to be a great tonic during convalescence. "Pearl" barley is the name of the grain when it's been polished, after the husk and bran have been removed. It's the form most commonly used in soups. Grains like barley keep well. Their bulk and comparative cheapness make them a useful staple, especially at this soup-worthy time of the year, so be sure to keep some in your cupboard. In a saucepan, combine the barley and 3 cups of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour, or until the liquid is absorbed. Meanwhile, heat the saute liquid in a large pot and add the onion, carrots, celery, and mushrooms. Cover and sweat the vegetables for about 5 minutes, until they begin to soften. Add the remaining vegetable stock and simmer 30 minutes, covered. Add the barley and simmer 5 minutes more. Add salt to taste and ladle into bowls. Serve garnished with some chopped fresh parsley.

      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>

      <li>2 Oranges, juice of</li>
      <li>1/2 Onion, choppped</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 Whole peppercorns</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cumin seeds (up to 2)</li>
      <li>1/2 bunches Cilantro (about 1/2 c.)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Pumpkin or sunflower seeds (meat only)</li>
      <li>2 Serrano chiles</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Brown sugar</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>3 Big Jim, Anaheim, or poblano/pasilla chiles, green and red (up to 5)</li>
      <li>2 cups Hominy, rinsed</li>
      <li>3 Green plantains</li>
      <li>2 cups Duck stock (you can make this from the bones and skin of the breast)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Well, here's a recipe I came up with. Your request was kind of like a game my wife and do -- name three ingredients and the other person has to come up with something. My wife added plantains to the mix (I don't know why!). In the process the chiles kind of took on a secondary role. Anyway, the cilantro sauce is inspired by a cilantro/cumin/habenero sauce from a restaurant, but here it's milder and sweet to go with the duck. This should serve about 4 people. Cut the duck into bite-sized slices and mix with the marinade. Let stand for 3 or 4 hours (at least). Meanwhile, toast the cumin seeds until fragrant and grind into a powder. Puree the cilantro, pumpkin seeds, cumin and chiles (seeds and all). Add salt to taste. Roast and peel the chiles. Deseed and cut into strips. Set aside. Boil the plantains, let them cool, peel, and slice into rounds about 1/4" thick. Put them in a pot with the hominy, stock, and salt to taste. Bring to a boil then simmer until tender. Drain and keep warm. Remove the duck from the marinade (reserve the juice) and dry. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet at medium/high heat. Sear the duck in the pan, add the chiles, bring back to heat, then remove, and set aside (leaving the juices in the pan). Add the sugar to the pan and cook until it any remaining liquid boils away and the sugar starts to carmelize. Add the marinade, bring to a boil and then reduce to about 1/2 c. Pour the hot marinade into the cilantro/cumin mix and process until smooth. It should be a thick saunce, almost a paste. On a platter make a bed of hominy and plantains with the duck and chiles mounded in the center. Garnish with fresh cilantro and dollops of the sauce, serving the rest on the side.

      <li>Ingredient Group: SPONGE</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Envelopes; (1 tablespoon) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Unbleached; all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: DOUGH</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Golden raisins</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Currants</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Diced candied orange or lemon peel; or a combination</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Soft unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground allspice</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs</li>
      <li>3 cups Unbleached; all-purpose flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the sponge, in a small saucepan over low flame, heat the milk and water until just warm, about 110 degrees. Pour into a small bowl, whisk in yeast and stir in flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow sponge to rise for 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk. Combine the raisins, currants and candied peel in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Drain fruit and spread it in a single layer on paper towels to cool and dry slightly while preparing the dough. To mix the dough by hand, beat butter with sugar, salt and spices until soft and smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then continue beating until smooth and light. Stir in sponge and remaining flour. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. To make the dough in a mixer, use a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle and beat butter with sugar, salt and spices until soft and smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then continue beating until smooth and light. Beat in sponge and remaining flour. Continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. To mix the dough in the food processor, place butter, sugar, salt, spices and eggs in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 10 or 12 times at 1-second intervals to mix smooth. Remove metal blade and attach plastic blade; add sponge and remaining flour and pulse to form a dough. Process continuously for 15 seconds. Place dough in a buttered bowl and cover with buttered plastic wrap, butter side down. Allow dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough to deflate and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Distribute fruit on dough and knead it in evenly by continuing to fold dough over onto itself. Cover with plastic wrap or a dry towel and allow to rest 30 minutes. Butter two 8-inch diameter by 2-inch deep cake pans and line the bottom of each with a piece of parchment or butter waxed paper, cut to fit. Place half the dough in each and press to make tops flat and even. Cover pans with buttered plastic wrap or a dry towel and allow Bracks to rise until doubled, up to 1 hour. Once the Bracks have begun to puff visibly, set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. When the Bracks are completely risen, bake them for about 45 minutes, or until well risen and a deep golden brown. Test by inserting a thin knife or skewer near the center; if it is done it will emerge without any raw dough clinging to it. Cool on racks for 5 minutes, then unmold and place rack on racks to cool completely.

      <li>In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring, until translucent. Add barley; stir to coat with the oil. Reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking barley, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes; take care not to let it brown. While barley is cooking, bring vegetable stock to a boil. Add vegetable stock to barley, a cup at time. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is almost absorbed before adding more liquid. Keep adding liquid, stirring frequently until barley pearls are al dente, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes. Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute eggplant, stirring frequently, until soft, about 12 minutes. Set aside. Using skillet in which eggplant was cooked, add remaining tablespoon of oil. Saute shrimp until pink. When barley is done, stir in eggplant and shrimp. Add grated pecorino cheese. Serve. Source: Odette Fada, Rex Il Restaurante, Los Angeles Fada's barley risotto is easy to make. It's a great way to offer the luxury of shellfish. Because the shrimp is cut into pieces, you only a half-pound of it to make risotto for 6-8 people. Despite the shrimp, this dish is predominantly grain. It's high in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and low in fat. But it's so exciting that one hesitates to label it with the stigma of "healthy eating." Best of all, here's a dish that fits the proverbial champagne taste on a beer budget; in total, ingredients for this risotto cost about $10. Add a salad and a cheese course and you can feed a small dinner party for about $5 a head. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <category>Tomatoes</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds); cut crosswise</li>
      <li>5 cups Water; more if needed</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Chicken stock; homemade or canned</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 Onion; chopped fine</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Pearl barley (about 11 ounces)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese; grated</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Heavy cream; optional</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Nicoise olives; chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Put the halved tomatoes, cut-side up, on a baking sheet. Dry the tomatoes in the oven until shriveled but still juicy, not hard and dry, about 2 hours. Let cool and then cut into 1/2-inch pieces. In a medium saucepan, bring the water and stock to a boil. Remove from the heat and keep covered. In another medium saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the barley and stir to coat. Add about a third of the hot stock mixture and cook at a gentle boil, stirring occasionally, until absorbed. Add another third of the stock and cook, stirring frequently, until absorbed. Add the remaining stock and the salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the barley is tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes total cooking time. Any stock that has not been absorbed should be thickened by the starch from the barley. Stir the barley vigorously to make the texture creamier. If it is dry, add more water. Stir in the butter, Parmesan, the cream, if using, and three quarters of both the tomatoes and the olives. Serve the barley risotto topped with the remaining tomatoes and olives.

    <category>Beverages</category>
    <quantity>5</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>7 pounds Light honey</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Corn sugar</li>
      <li>1 ounce To 6 oz fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Gypsum</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons Yeast nutrient OR...</li>
      <li>1/4 ounces Yeast extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Irish moss powder</li>
      <li>1 pound To 6 lbs crushed fruit</li>
      <li>3 ounces Lemongrass, or other spices</li>
      <li>1 package Champagne yeast</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Corn sugar (bottling)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Boil 1 1/2 gallons of water, the honey, corn sugar, grated ginger root, gypsum, citric acid, irish moss, and yeast nutrient for 15 minutes. Turn the heat off. If you're going to add fruit (this is entirely optional, as are the spices) then fish out as much of the ginger root shavings as you can. Then add your crushed fruit or concentrate and let it steep for 10-15 minutes. Some ideas for fruit are: Sour cherries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, chokecherries, rhubarb, grapes, grape concentrate... go wild here. Pour the entire must (unsparged if fruit is added) into an open primary fermenter and add about 3 gallons of cold water. When cooled to 70 to 78 degrees, hydrate and pitch your yeast. After the specific gravity has fallen to 1.020 or within 7 days, whichever comes first, rack the brew into a secondary fermenter. Leave the fruit behind. Age 1 to 1 1/2 months in the secondary fermenter. Bottle with 3/4 cups priming sugar. If using spices or herbs as a flavoring, add them now by making a "tea" and adding them at bottling time. The flavors will be fresher and sharper. Some suggested spices are lemon grass, citrus peel (just the zest, not the white part), etc. If using cloves, cinnamon, or hops go lightly on these. Adding flavors in this manner also allows you to use different flavors in the same batch, since you're just adding a "tea" to the mead at bottling time. You can bottle two or three flavors at once this way! This mead should age from 3 months up to a year to allow the harsh flavors to mellow out. Tasting at 6 months will show approximate flavor profile. Serve well chilled. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Date: Wed, 20 Mar 1996 11:40:18 +1100 From: sherae@zeta.org.au (Sheri McRae) Peel onions and slice 1/8 inch thick, preferably in a food processor. Melt butter in a 6-quart (or larger) stockpot. Add onions; cook, uncovered, over low heat for 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (The long cooking time makes the onions mellow and sweet.) Stir in pepper, paprika and bay leaf; saute over low heat 10 minutes more, stirring frequently. Pour in 6 cans broth and wine. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve flour in remaining 1 can broth. Stir into boiling soup. Reduce heat and simmer slowly for 2 hours. Adjust color to a rich brown with caramel coloring, season with salt. Refrigerate overnight. To serve, heat soup in microwave or on stove top. If desired, pour into ovenproof crocks or bowls. Top with a slice of breat and a sprinkling of grated cheese. Heat under the broiler until cheese melts and bubbles, about 5 minutes. Leftover soup can be frozen. Yield: 4 quarts.

Averting your face, add the water (it will bubble up furiously) Return the saucepan to the heat, cover and cook for about 2O to 25 minutes or until barley has absorbed the liquid and is just tender. Transfer the barley to a sieve and drain under cold water; pat dry and set aside. During the time it takes to cook the barley, peel, halve and seed the cucumbers and cut them into 1/2 inch half moons. Halve and seed the zucchini and yellow squash, cut them into 1/2 inch half moons and parboil them for a minute, drain and pat dry. In the bottom of a mixing bowl combine the mayonnaise, vinegar and dill; season well with salt and pepper. To the dressing add the cooked barley, cucumbers and squash and toss well; adjust the seasoning. On the outside edge of a serving platter, make a ring of drained sliced pickled beets. Pile the barley salad in the middle and center some watercress leaves in the middle of the salad. Yield: 4 servings FATFREE DIGEST V96 #156 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 ounces Pot barley</li>
      <li>2 1/2 pints Good quality chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 Lemon</li>
      <li>1 Fat garlic clove</li>
      <li>2 Leeks</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 Chicken livers, if available</li>
      <li>Cold cooked chicken meat *</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Coarsley chopped parsley</li>
      <li>1 small Knob butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note: The recipe calls for 1-2 chicken livers, if available, and "shreds of cold cooked chicken meat, if available". Grate the zest of the lemon very finely and reserve it. Put the barley into a soup pan, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and cold chicken stock. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for about 40 minutes until the barley is tender with just a hint of bite to the centre of the grain. Add the chicken meat, if used, to the pan towards the end of this time to heat it through gently but thoroughly. When the barley is nearly ready, slice the mushrooms thickly, and slice the leeks (tender green parts as well as the white) very thinly indeed so that the leaves fall into ribbony shreds. Cut the chicken livers, if available, into 2 to 3 pieces and saute them briefly in the butter until crusty on the outside but still pink within. Fry the mushrooms in the fat remaining in the pan then reduce the heat and cook the leeks gently for 2 to 3 minutes, just shaking occasionally. Then add contents of the frying pan to the soup pan. Add the mushrooms and check seasoning. Put the chicken livers into a warmed soup tureen and crush with a fork to make a coarse paste. Add the finely chopped garlic, the lemon zest and most of the parsley. Pour on the piping hot soup, stir to mix well, sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top and serve. Note: If the soup is not served straight away, but allowed to get cold, the barley will go on swelling and softening; when reaheated the dish then seems more like a stew than a soup. I like it this way but you may prefer to lift out the grain and cool it down separately from the rest of the soup. Source: Philippa Davenport in "Country Living" (British), February 1988.

      <li>From: Ruth Heiges &lt;heiges@post.tau.ac.il&gt; Date: Sun, 11 Aug 1996 16:00:22 +0300 (IDT) If you are using canned vegetables (you will need two 1-lb cans), drain the vegetables and save 2 Tbsp of the liquid. If you are using fresh or frozen vegetables, save the same amount of liquid (2 Tbsp) in which they have been cooked. Soak the sweet pepper flakes and parsley in water until they are soft. Then drain off any excess liquid. Heat the oil in a skillet until it is sizzling and add the onions and garlic and fry until they are golden brown. Blend the curry powder or paste with the tomato paste. Mix with the 2 Tbsp vegetable liquid and add to the pan with the onions and garlic. Add the garlic salt, sugar and cumin. Stir over low fire until the mixture is very thick and smooth (5-10 minutes). With a wooden spoon, carefully fold in the drained vegetables. Heat through. (Served cold, this vegetable curry makes an excellent summer luncheon course and is enough for 4 servings.) Cool the vegetable curry. Then place about 1 teaspoon of it along one side of each bread slice. Use a flat knife such as a butter knife to press the filling flat. Roll in the filled side of the bread, using fingertips to secure the roll. Then continue rolling as tightly as possible. This is to prevent the bread from uncurling during frying. Fasten the rolls with toothpicks and fry them in hot oil until golden brown. Drain, cut each roll in half, and serve at once with chutney dip. The rolls may be frozen before frying by placing them on a cookie sheet in the freezer. When they have frozen, transfer to a freezer bag or container for future use. Chutney Dip: Combine chutney, chilies and yogurt or sour cream. Sprinkle with minced coriander leaves. Chill.

    <quantity>70</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Rolled oats (oatmeal)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Barley flour (if</li>
      <li>Unavailable, use all-</li>
      <li>Purpose flour)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Honey</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Warm water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"Barley flour gives these crackers lightness, and the oats provide a sweet, nutty flavor. For those cracker-lovers who are allergic to wheat, oats and barley are a blessing. Try these crackers with a glass of cold, freshly squeezed orange juice for a quick and nutritious breakfast. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. Grind the oats in a blender or food processor to a fairly fine consistency (about 25 pulses with the food processor). In a large bowl or in the food processor, mix the oats with the flour, salt, and baking soda. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl, dissolve the honey in the warm water and slowly blend this sweetened water into the flour mixture until the dough will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch. Cut out 2-inch crackers with a cookie cutter, juice can, or knife and arrange on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. With the tines of a fork, prick each cracker 2 or 3 times. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake another 5 to 10 minutes, or until very lightly browned. The flavor of these crackers is best if they are not allowed to become more than pale brown. Cool the crackers on a rack. Yield: 60-70.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Barley flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Rolled barley (barley</li>
      <li>Flakes)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter or</li>
      <li>Margarine, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Milk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"Very few people really know the taste of barley. Rolled barley looks like oatmeal, but has a slightly sharper taste and less nutty flavor. These sweet barley crackers have a tender texture. Try them with just a cold glass of milk. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F. In a large bowl or in the food processor, stir together the flours, barley, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add enough of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut into 2-inch circles or squares and place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until medium brown. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 45-55. VARIATIONS: For a richer cracker, substitute 2 Tablespoons barley malt syrup for the sugar and reduce the amount of milk slightly. This recipe can be made with oatmeal (rolled oats) and oat flour for a distinctive oat flavor. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 medium Acorn squash, or another winter squash of a similar size</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Almonds; chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Onions; chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Thyme</li>
      <li>1 cup Barley; cooked</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Tamari</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and membrane and place the squash cut-side down on a lightly oiled baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees until the squash is still firm, but tender enough to easily scoop out with a spoon, about 45 minutes. After the squash has been baking about 25 minutes, place the chopped almonds in a pie tin or another small ovenproof container and bake until they turna toasty light brown (10-15 minutes). Check boththe almonds and the sqash occasionally so you will know when they are done. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and the thyme. Saute over low heat until the onions are well done. Add the cooked barley, tamari, and toasted almonds to the sauteed onions. Using a small spoon, scoop bite-sized chunks out of the cooked squash, leaving enough flesh around the shell so that it stays strong enough to hold its shape. Add the scooped out squash to the barley mixture. Mix well. Fill the empty squash shells with this mixture, mounding it as high as possible. Place the stuffed squash in a baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. From the files of DEEANNE From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan heat the vegetable oil; add the barley and cook the grain, stirring constantly, until it smells toasty. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Averting your face, add the water (it will bubble up furiously) Return the saucepan to the heat, cover and cook for about 2O to 25 minutes or until barley has absorbed the liquid and is just tender. Transfer the barley to a sieve and drain under cold water; pat dry and set aside. During the time it takes to cook the barley, peel, halve and seed the cucumbers and cut them into 1/2 inch half moons. Halve and seed the zucchini and yellow squash, cut them into 1/2 inch half moons and parboil them for a minute, drain and pat dry. In the bottom of a mixing bowl combine the mayonnaise, vinegar and dill; season well with salt and pepper. To the dressing add the cooked barley, cucumbers and squash and toss well; adjust the seasoning. On the outside edge of a serving platter, make a ring of drained sliced pickled beets. Pile the barley salad in the middle and center some watercress leaves in the middle of the salad.

      <li>Date: Thu, 28 Mar 96 15:52 PST From: ddevries@wimsey.com (David DeVries) To Zoe Sodja who was looking for a vegan shepherd's pie recipe. This is one I make all the time, even my kids will eat it and that's saying something. Bring water to a boil, add lentils and barley. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes until water is absorbed. Heat broth in dutch oven, add garlic, carrot or other veggies and onion and cook until tender. Add tomatoes, mushrooms and spices and cook for 5 minutes. Mix flour with a little bit of water and add to the mixture. Stir and cook over low heat until thickened adding some of the reserved tomato liquid if necessary. Add barley and lentils and combine well. Top with mashed potatoes and sprinkle with salt &amp; pepper, cornflake crumbs or whatever you wish and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes (45 minutes if made ahead and at room temp.) This recipe feeds 6 to 10 people, depending on whether you have a salad with it. You can also divide it among 3 or 4 containers and freeze for later.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Garlic clove, chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Washed pearl barley</li>
      <li>2 cans Stock</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Saute some sliced mushrooms (say a cup or so), in a teaspoon or so of butter. Or sweat the mushrooms after sprinkling with butter flavor or butter extract. Take a 1-1/2 quart ovenproof dish and add 1-1/2 cups washed pearl barley. Add 2 cans (about 3-3/4 c) stock (see note below). Add the mushrooms, deglazing the pan with a bit of the stock. Bake, covered, in a medium oven (350-375 deg F) until the barley is tender (notice that barley never gets soft--it's more like al dente, there's a little resistance, but no starchy core) which takes about an hour or so, depending on the age of the barley, etc. Add more stock if it dries out before it's done, but don't drown it. Optional extras--sweat a little minced garlic, a clove or two, in a little broth until it softens. Do the same with chopped onion, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Broth note--I use beef-flavored boullion because the flavors of beef and barley go very well together--this dish is very "meaty" and satisfying. You can certainly use any good broth, as long as it's not too salty. There are quite a few good vegetarian beef-flavored broths, as well as vegetable flavored broths, both canned and dry. This isn't good with chicken-flavored broth; something about the barley just doesn't work. Two good books are Greene on Grain and Great Grains, but I think this recipe came from somewhere else.

      <li>2 tablespoons Melted butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place squash in a suitable deep pot with cover. Add enough water to barely cover squash. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and cook 5 min. Drain water immediately and transfer squash to a 2 1/2 qt. shallow oven-proof casserole. Allow to cool completely, then slice in half lengthwise. Hollow out the halves as much as possible. When this is done, transfer the squash to a large sheet of waxed paper or foil. Brush with the melted butter and dust with Gruyere and set aside. Cook spinach with as little water as possible, then drain all the water. Transfer spinach to a mixing bowl. In a skillet, heat butter and olive oil. Saute the onion until soft and translucent but not browned. Add the almonds and cook until golden Add this saute to the mixing bowl. Now add the next four ingredients up to and including the Gruyere cheese. Mix well. Grease the shallow 2 qt. casserole generously with butter. With a tbsp., fill the hollowed squash with the stuffing, mounding it neatly. As you do this, transfer the squash to the prepared oven proof casserole. Combine the breadcrumbs and melted butter. Brush the stuffed squash with mixture. Refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap for about 1 hr. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for about 1 to 20 min or until golden. Remove from oven and sprinkle with Sherry wine. This will make 12 small squashed, or 6 larger ones. Posted to EAT-L Digest by Lillian Mount &lt;BirdsEtc@AOL.COM&gt; on Aug 31, 1997</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The following is a recipe for roast beef taken from my Simply Delicious Cooking 2 cookbook, just exchange the baron of beef for an equal weight rib roast. Try to get a rib roast that is at least "aged" for 21-28 days, Never buy any red meat from a local supermarket chain. they simply do not age it long enough. You may begin your roast in the high oven for 10 minutes which sears the meat and locks in the juices, then turn the oven down and continue to cook as per instructions. Preheat the oven to 325 F (160 C). Mix the flour, mustard and seasonings together. Rub into the roast. Place roast into a roasting pan. Pour Worcestershire over. Surround roast with the vegetables and bay leaf. Pour in the red wine and water. Bake to desired doneness see chart below, basting often. Use the pan juices to make gravy.

      <li>Makes 1 loaf Combine 1 tablespoon of the sugar, warm water and yeast. Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Blend egg into yeast mixture. Fit processor with steel blade. Measure flour, butter, 2 tablespoons of the remaining sugar and salt into work bowl. Process until mixed, about 15 seconds. Turn on processor and slowly add yeast mixture through feed tube to flour mixture. Process until blended, about 10 seconds. Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough milk into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes. Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining milk to make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until dough turns around bowl about 15 times. Turn dough onto lighyly greased surface. Knead raisins, currants and candied fruit peel into dough. Shape into smooth ball and place on greased cookie sheet. Flatten ball into a circle about 6 inches in diameter. Brush with oil and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Heat oven to 350 F. Bake until bread sounds hollow when tapped, 40 - 50 minutes. Mix cold water with remaining 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Remove bread immediately from cookie sheet and place on wire rack. Brush with sugar-water mixture. Cool.

    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe illustrates an interesting bit of history. Corn came from the New World and was taken to Italy. Our beloved cornmeal mush be came known as polenta in Italy, and while in Italy Mr. Jefferson learned a new trick. He brought this recipe back with him and evidently served it often at the plantation. Bring the water to a boil. Add the salt and slowly stir in the polenta. Stir constantly to avoid lumps. After the mixture begins to thicken you can stir less frequently. Simmer for about 20 minutes or until very thick. Pour into a greased loaf mold or bread pan. Allow to cool in the refrigerator overnight. Cut into 1/4-inch slices and layer like tiles in a baking dish. Pour the butter or oil over the top and then the cheese. Bake in 375ø ovens for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and all begins to brown just a bit. INCLUDES OVERNIGHT CHILLING TIME From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel the plantains, cut them into small chunks &amp; put into a large deep mixing bowel. Mash into a thick paste with your fingers or an electric clender. If using a blender, you may need to add 30-60 ml of water for smoother blending. Add the chilli sambal, rice flour, salt and mix well. Gently heat the corn oil in a frying pan and add the turmeric. Stir well, remove from the heat and blend into the plantain mixture which should be thinck yet soft enough to pour. If it is too soft, add small amounts of rice flour or if too stiff, add small amounts of water until it reached th described consistency. Grease a loaf tin, and pour plantain mixture into it. Bake in teh overn on medium to low heat at 150-180C for 1 hr. or until cooked and firm. When cooked, remove from the overn and allow to stand for approximately 5-10 mins before turning it out on a wire rack. Slice and serve with salted peanuts or as an accompaniment to spicy dishes.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Bulb fennel (about 1 pound)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste; or Mrs. dash</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound Medium red potatoes (about 4)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Per Serving: Cal 87 Fat 2 grams FROM: First, March 1990 (magazine for women) Section: Mediterranean Light Heat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly spray a 2 quart baking dish. Cut off the tops of the fennel but keep the feathery leaves for garnish. Cut fennel into thin slices. Put in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with seasonings and toss with the oil. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake til almost tender. Add thinly sliced potatoes to the fennel, add more seasoning if desired. Cover and bake until potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve hot or warm. Notes: I haven't made this yet, but I see no reason to cook in two steps. My experience with cooking potatoes in the oven suggests that they will take about the same time as the fennel. I will layer them, after tossing both in the oil and seasonings, then cook them together. I'll let you know when I do it. Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n174 by "Tina D.

      <li>Fresh lime juice of 2 limes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>Fresh or dry rosemary to taste</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SAUCE</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium Yellow onion; peeled and diced</li>
      <li>6 Cloves garlic; peeled and minced</li>
      <li>15 ounces Tomatoes with liquid; peeled and diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Liquid hot sauce; (or more)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fresh parsley; minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh rosemary OR; minced</li>

      <li>To taste salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese; freshly grated</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>If you like a lot of sauce and want to serve this with rice or pasta, double the sauce ingredients. Any firm fish can be substituted for the snapper. To absorb excess water in fish, place fillets on paper towels and squeeze gently. Combine marinade ingredients and pour over fish in a zipper bag. Refrigerate for an hour or so; turning occassionally. When ready to prepare, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a 10-inch frying pan over medium heat and add onion and garlic. Cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add remaining ingredients, except fish. Cook, uncovered, over low heat until sauce is thick and smooth, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place fish fillets in a single layer in a baking dish. Pour sauce over fish and bake, uncovered, until fish flakes when pierced with fork, about 20 minutes.

    <quantity>10</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 pounds Red potatoes; (about 7*)</li>
      <li>2 cups Sargento Light Fancy shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>8 ounces Fat-free ranch salad dressing</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Prepared mustard</li>
      <li>6 Green onions; chopped</li>
      <li>1 Red bell pepper; chopped</li>
      <li>2 slices Turkey bacon; cooked and crumbled</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Guess my potatoes were smaller than theirs - about 14 for me. Coat potatoes with vegetable cooking spray; pierce several times with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes or until tender. Cool and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine 1-1/2 cups cheese, dressing, and next 3 ingredients in a large bowl; add potato, tossing gently. Sprinkle with bacon and remaining 1/2 cup of cheese. Lou's notes: I did not have the Sargento Light cheese, so I used regular mild Cheddar cheese. Also, I did not have turkey bacon so I used regular. I thought the ratio of mix to potatoes was a bit off . Next time, I will use more potatoes. I let the potatoes cool a bit before I added them so as not to melt the cheese. Served the salad at room temperature. The next day, I had it cold, and it was good that way, too. This is a very tasty dish. Clearly, there has been an effort to reduce the fat, but no caloric nor fat information was given.

      <li>Date: Fri, 01 Mar 1996 03:22:46 -0400 From: Manzanita &lt;manzana@dorsai.org&gt; Here's one from Gourmet magazine a few years back--I made this recipe a couple of times--I substituted shitake mushrooms with Portobellos--yum! It's worth the prep time! I didn't do the star thing that the recipe calls for, I just made the top layer smooth. I have to also finish transcribing a good one from Bon Apetit this month,--a delicious roasted vegetable casserole with a polenta top--I'll send that to you soon, too. But for now try this one!! Make the mushroom ragout: In a large deep skillet cook the onion, the garlic, and the rosemary in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the mushrooms and salt to taste, and cook the mixture over moderately high heat, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated. Stir in the tomato paste and the wine and boil the mushroom mixture until most of the liquid is evaporated. In a small bowl stir the cornstarch into the broth, add the mixture and the Worcestershire sauce to the mushroom mixture, and bring the ragout to a boil, stirring. Simmer the ragout for 2 minutes and season it with salt and pepper. In a large heavy saucepan bring the water with the oil to a boil and add 1 cup of the cornmeal, a little at a time, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low, add the remaining 1 cup cornmeal in a slow stream, stirring constantly, and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, 2/3 cup of the Parmesan, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread one third of the polenta evenly in a buttered 13- by 9-inch baking dish and chill the polenta sheet for 20 minutes, or until it is firm. While the polenta is chilling, working quickly, spread half the remaining polenta in a buttered 3-quart shallow baking dish, top it with half the mushroom ragout, and top the ragout with the mozzarella. Spread the remaining polenta quickly over the mozzarella and top it with the remaining ragout. Invert the polenta sheet onto a work surface and with 1 or more star-shaped cutters cut out as many stars as possible. Arrange the stars decoratively on the ragout and sprinkle them with the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan. The layered polenta may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Preheat the oven to 400øF. Bake the layered polenta in the upper third of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the polenta stars are golden. NOTE: The recipe did NOT call for any cornmeal! I assume from the instructions that 2 cups is what is needed....Glen MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MasterCook recipe list.

    <title>Baked Polenta with Bacon and Onions</title>
    <category>Italian</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Slices lean bacon, chopped</li>
      <li>2 Onions, sliced thin</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Dried crumbled sage</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Coarse ground cornmeal</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh grated Parmesan</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large saucepan, cook bacon until almost crisp. Remove the bacon and take out all but 1 tbsp of the fat. Add the onions and cook until softened but not browned. Transfer the onion to a bowl. To the pan add the water, broth and sage and bring to a boil. Stirring constantly, add the cornmeal, a little at a time. Cook over low heat, stirring almost constantly, until it is thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan, 20-25 minutes. Stir in the butter, 2 tbsp of the Parmesan and half the onions. Spread in a 3 cup gratin dish. Mix the bacon into the remaining onion mixture and spread on top of the polenta. Sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan and bake in the middle of a preheated 400 oven until the cheese is melted and just starting to brown. This serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a side dish. Can be doubled or tripled and can be made and assembled earlier in the day and baked when ready to serve.

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Cayenne pepper; or to taste</li>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut off the very top of the pineapple and place it in a roasting pan. Roast the whole pineapple for about 1 hour, then remove from the oven and, as soon as it is cool enough to handle, cut it first into 8 thick rounds, crosswise. Cut these slices in half and arrange on a platter. Squeeze the lime juice over the pineapple, dust with cayenne pepper, and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. (Pineapple will dry out if it is not roasted whole. Diners should pick up the halfrounds of pineapple with their hands and nibble the tender flesh from the inside of the rind.)

      <li>From: PatH &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; Date: Tue, 7 May 1996 16:01:52 -0700 (PDT) Recipe by: Hanneman The idea: substitute portabella mushroom for the meat in a favorite Italian recipe. This served 2 easily and would have served 3. Pre-warm/cook everything, assemble it in a casserole, top with mozzarella and bake it about 15 minutes. PastaZesta is a new product for us. It's a spaghetti, homemade, dried, flat like soba, made of durum wheat, flavored with various - we chose tomat and basil. No eggs! Very light and flavorful. Cooks in 3 minutes. It comes in a tan 8-oz box and was near the bottled sauces. We recommend it. Made in Canada. STEP #1 Using a micro-wave proof dish, like a pyrex measure, combine the tomato sauce, garlic, basil, oregano and red pepper flakes. Zap at 100% fo about 2 minutes (700 watts). Stir and let stand. MEANWHILE prepare the pasta. STEP #2 Heat oil in skillet. Press some (what you can) wheat germ into th slices of mushroom and saute over medium-high heat, turning once, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Remove from heat. STEP #3 Set oven temperature to 375oF. Place drained pasta in a shallow casserole. Pour half the sauce on top and spread. Season with pepper (a little salt). Sprinkle on remaining wheat germ, especially along the outer edge where it will catch the sauce. Layer the mushroom slices on top of that. Pour on the remaining sauce. Top with cheese. Top with parsley. Bake about 15 minutes until cheese is melted and beginning to brown. Nice served with asparagus.

      <li>1/2 cups Chopped scallions; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's a dish that makes potatoes the main attraction. It's adapted from 500 Fat-Free Recipes by S. Schlesinger. It is also quite filling depending on the size of the potatoes. 1. Preheat oven to 375F 2. Spread 1 Tbs. cottage cheese over each potato half 3. Add 1/4 cup baked beans to each potato half 4. Top the baked beans on each potato half with 1 Tbs. grated cheese and 1 Tbs. scallions. 5. Bake until cheese melts, about 5 to 10 minutes. Per Sv: 244 cal; 14g prot; 46g carb; 6.9g fiber; .4g fat; 255mg sod; I usually serve this with what I call my Kitchen Sink Salad - everything in it but the kitchen sink - lots of veggies (greens, corn and peas from the freezer, radishes, jicama, etc.) or else I serve it with stir-fry veggies.

      <li>1/4 cups Cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Beat butter until soft. Gradually add the sugar and blend until creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time. In a bowl, combine raisins, currants, and pecans and sprinkle lightly with flour. Add these ingredients to the butter mixture. Combine breadcrumbs, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice; stir these ingredients into the butter mixture. Bake in a greased tube pan or baking dish for about 1/2 hour. Serve with about 1 cup Hard Sauce. Hard Sauce: The basic ingredients of hard sauce are always the same, although proportions and flavoring may vary. In this recipe, the larger amount of butter is preferable. An attractive way to serve hard sauce on cold cake or pudding is to chill it and mold it with a small fancy cutter--or put it through and individual butter mold. Sift the powdered sugar. Beat butter until soft; add sugar gradually. Beat well until ingredients are well blended. Add the salt and flavoring. Beat in the egg or cream. Continue to beat until sauce is very smooth. Chill thoroughly. Posted to EAT-L Digest 01 Aug 96 Date: Fri, 2 Aug 1996 10:46:58 -0500 From: LD Goss &lt;ldgoss@METRONET.COM&gt;</li>

Your kids will love it. Clean and peel some pumpkin and cut it into thick slices. Arrange them in a buttered baking dish and add sliced onions. Add salt and pepper and a bit of melted butter or olive oil. Repeat with another layer and top with a few spoons of brown sugar. Bake, uncovered, at 350ø until tender, about 30 minutes.

      <li>1 Egg yolk; lightly beaten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sweet, soft toasty-brown buns surround a tangy barbecued pork filling. Makes 12 buns. Cooking time: 30 minutes. Preparation : In a large bowl, dissolve 2 tablespoons of the sugar in milk and water. Sprinkle yeast over top of the milk mixture and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes or until frothy. Gradually mix in remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, flour, and salt. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for about 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm area for about 1 hour or until doubled. Meanwhile, soak mushrooms in enough warm water to cover for 30 minutes; drain. Cut off and discard stems; coarsely chop caps. Set aside. Cooking Place wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot. Add oil, swirling to coat sides. Add green onions, garlic, and mushrooms; stir-fry for 1 minute. Stir in water, hoisin sauce, and sugar; mix well. Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring until sauce boils down and thickens. Add pork, mix well. Remove from heat and let cool. Punch down dough, then roll on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch long cylinder. Cut cylinder crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Shape each piece into a ball; let rest for 5 minutes. To shape each dumpling flatten one ball with a rolling pin to make a 4 to 6-inch circle, keeping dough covered to prevent drying. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of filing in the center fo each circle (see illustration). Gather the edges of the circle over the filing; close top by pleating, pinching and twisting edges together. Place buns, pleated side down, on a baking sheet, allowing enough room for rising. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes or until light and puffy. Brush tops of buns with egg yolk. Let rise for 15 more minutes. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Tips: Traditionally, these buns are steamed over boiling water, pleated side up, for 12 to 15 minutes rather than baked. Follow the same procedure for preparing dough except do not brush tops of buns with egg yolk. Try other fillings, such as minced chicken, pork or shrimp.

      <li>1/4 cups All purpose flour</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 large Whole egg lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 large Egg white, lightly beaten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The following recipes appeared last year in the N.Y.Daily News. The second recipe is from Helen Nash, a well-known New York writer of kosher cookbooks. (Printed by Random House) Set oven racks to lowest and highest positions. Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees. Brush 2 heavy baking sheets with 2 teaspoons of oil each. Peel and cut the onion into quarters and chop very finely in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Empty onion into a bowl. Using the fine shredding blade of a food processor, grate potatoes finely and add them to the onion. Add flour, salt and pepper; toss with 2 forks to mix well. Add whole egg, egg white and remaining teaspoon oil; mix. Warm baking sheets: If size of oven permits, place both oiled sheets side by side in upper rack of pre-heated oven, because lower rack will burn oil. Drain potato mixture, if necessary, and drop level tablespoons of potato mixture onto the prepared warm baking sheets and press lightly to flatten. Bake on lowest rack, side by side, for 10 minutes, or until golden brown on bottom. Turn over and bake for 5 minutes longer, or until they seem cooked. This side will not get brown or very crisp. Transfer to platter, arranging latkes browned side up. Note: Cooked latkes may be refrigerated. Reheat at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes, or until hot. They also can be frozen,properly wrapped, and heated without thawing at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, or until hot.

      <li>*Fresh Tomato Sauce recipe posted separately. Hill and Barclay write: "This is our idea of comfort food! Bland cornmeal needs a real shot of flavor, so don't hold back on the herbs." Heat olive oil in a medium skillet; saute onion, garlic and sweet pepper until hot through. Add crumbled sausage and continue cooking just until meat changes color. Stir in mushrooms and cook until hot through. Drain excess fat and set mixture aside. Place milk or other liquid in a large, heavy saucepan over moderately high heat; slowly add cornmeal, stirring briskly with a wire whisk to prevent lumping. Bring to a boil and cook 10 minutes, or until mixture is very thick and smooth; stir constantly to prevent scorching. Remove pan from heat and stir in herbs, cayenne pepper, and ricotta and gruyere cheeses. Add sausage and sweet pepper mixture, combine well, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour mixture into two 9" pie plates lined with plastic wrap. Cool on a wire rack, then cover and refrigerate at least an hour, or as long as three days. When ready to serve dish, preheat oven to 375 F. Cut polenta in wedges and place on an oiled shallow baking pan large enough to hold polenta in one layer without crowding. Drizzle with melted butter and sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until polenta is lightly browned and very hot when tested with a small knife in center of wedge. Serve with Fresh Tomato Sauce. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and sprigs of herbs. From Madalene Hill and Gwen Barclay's "Sage through the Ages" article in "The Herb Companion."

    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's an old time idea that's probably "Mid-Western" enough for ya. This is something I picked up from my ex-Mennonite Grandmother in Hutchinson, Kasas. Take four nice thick pork chops and brown 'em on each side. Dice up four or so slices of stale bread++or bread dried out in the oven. Mix that into a can or so of creamed corn. How many cans you need will vary with the brand of corn. Add about half a chopped up yellow onion and a couple of beaten eggs. Mix the mess well and add salt an pepper to taste. Put the browned chops in a greased baking dish, pour the corn mixture over the chops and pop 'em in a 325F oven for about an hour. The corn topping should come out browned and fairly dry and the chops should be nice and succulent with a hint of sweetness from the corn. This is one dish that garlic will absolutely ruin! I've tried all sorts of ways to fancy up this dish but have never been successful in improving the original simple recipe. And there's not ONE squid tentacle in the whole mess!

    <title>Baked Polenta Casserole with Creamy Mushroom Sauce&amp; Fontina</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 ounce Dried porcini mushrooms</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Hot water</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Fresh cultivated white mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Freshly milled white pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Heavy cream</li>
      <li>Olive oil or vegetable oil for oiling boards and baking dish</li>
      <li>1 Recipe Basic Polenta</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Cornmeal; 6 cups water, and 2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Fontina cheese; shredded, 2 cups</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Parmesan cheese; freshly grated</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To begin to prepare the sauce, in a small bowl combine the dried porcini and hot water and let stand for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the porcini and squeeze out excess water. Using scissors, cut them into pieces about the size of your thumbnail. Set aside. Strain the mushroom liquor through a paper towel or a fine sieve; reserve. Lightly oil an 8-by-11-inch baking pan and set it aside. Lightly oil two large pastry boards or baking sheets, or a very large scratchproof counter surface. Make the polenta and when it is cooked, turn it directly out onto the boards, counter, or baking sheets. Use a large knife or rubber spatula, first dipped in cold water, to spread out the polenta to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Allow it to cool and harden, about 20 minutes. Cut it into approximate 3-inch squares. Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 400 degrees F. Continue to make the sauce. Using a soft brush or clean kitchen towel, remove any dirt from the fresh mushrooms. Don't wash them because water will alter their texture. Separate the stems from the caps, discarding the stems if they are tough. Slice the mushroom caps and tender stems thinly. In a skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter with the oil. Add the onion and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the porcini and saute for another 5 or 6 minutes to marry the flavors. Add the cultivated mushrooms and continue to saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mushroom soaking liquid, salt, and pepper. Allow to simmer gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in the cream, and allow the mixture barely to reach a simmer. Immediately remove the skillet from the heat. Place half of the polenta squares in a layer on the bottom of the prepared dish. Spread half of the sauce in a layer over them, then sprinkle with half of the cheeses. Place another layer of polenta squares over the cheeses. Spoon the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the remaining cheeses. Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and golden and the pasticcio is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let settle for 10 minutes before cutting into squares. Serve hot. Ahead-of-time note: This pasticcio can be assembled up to 3 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated, and then baked just before serving. Leftover pasticcio reheats well: Cover with aluminum foil and place in a preheated 375 degree F oven for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on whether it is chilled or at room temperature.

      <li>Mix all the dry ingredients in a LARGE bowl. Mix in caraway and rasins. Mix in buttermilk. It helps to use your hands to mix this because the dough is stickey DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC MIXER. I did this a couple of times and the bread came out very flat. Divide batter into two buttered cake pans. Flour a knife and cut a cross into the tops of each. Bake at 350 for about an hour. The top should not be allowed to get to brown. Source: It was my Grandmother's (Tom Purcia) recipe from county Mayo in Ireland.

Salt can be added, if you like. I also add some red pepper on the top before serving. Chilling seems to mix the flavors. Serve with pita wedges. With the sesame oil you really get the taste without all the fat. Play around with it. I have never tasted hummus that was the same, it all varies depending on who makes it! Oh yes, cucumber goes well with this (on top of pita wedge). Enjoy! Tyrrell in Texas Tyrrell Courtney &lt;tyrrellc@admin.stedwards.edu&gt; Fatfree Digest, Vol. 8, Issue 40, June 1, 1994.

In the cupboard: Canned Italian tuna in olive oil, canned anchovy fillets, canned sardines, imported green and black olives, jarred pickled vegetables, dried dates and prunes, capers, breadsticks, extra virgin olive oil, dried tomatoes, wine and balsamic vinegars In the refrigerator: Celery, carrots, lemons, Parmigiano-Reggiano, provolone In the freezer: Roasted peppers and Italian bread A simple antipasto platter can be assembled from jarred pickled vegetables, canned tuna, firm sharp cheese, olives, and breadsticks. The following are some additional quick and easy ideas: Pitted dates slit and stuffed with small pieces of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Thin slices of proscuitto, ham or salami, wrapped around thin bread sticks, cooked asparagus spears, wedges of pears or persimmon. Thin slices of smoked salmon wrapped around thin bread sticks. Dried tomatoes soaked in warm water and drained, then puree with garlic, olive oil, basil, and balsamic vinegar and spread on toast or crackers. Raw vegetables fennel, Belgian endive, carrots, celery, cut into spears to dip in olive oil seasoned with coarse salt and freshly cracked pepper. Bite size wedges of Parmigiano-Reggiano seasoned with a drop of balsamic vinegar. Fresh goat cheese drizzled with olive oil, chopped garlic, crushed red pepper, and oregano, parsley or basil. Balls or cubes of fresh mozzarella tossed with olive oil, chopped anchovies, parsley and crushed red pepper.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: MY MARIANADE</li>
      <li>1 Part Yasheeda's(sp) Gourmet Sauce (a very sweet Soy based liquid)</li>
      <li>1 Part Worchestershire sauce.</li>
      <li>1 Part Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>1 Part hot peper water (I'll explain later)</li>
      <li>1/2 Part salt (maybe less depending on your taste)</li>
      <li>Quite possibly some addtional water, up to two addtional parts, depending on</li>
      <li>What I feel like and how much meat I had to cover vs. how much liquid I wound up with</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: HOT PEPPER WATER</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Dryed crushed habanaros, about</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Well I start with a lean peice of beef, ussualy brisket, sometimes eye of round. I cut it in slices about a 1/4 of a inch thick, then trim all remaining fat off, and cut into strips about a inch wide and six inchs long. I place the meat in large Zip-lock type freezer bags. Then I marinate the meat over night in as soy/worchestershire/sugar/salt/habenaro liquid. Then I lay the meat out on my racks, being carfull not to allow the meat to rest in spots that have exsesive heat(like the outsid edges of my round water smoker grills). I currently use a water/gas/wood smoker with a adjustable flame level and tin foil log made of soaked wood chips. I sometimes use hickory and sometimes mesquite. I can fit about 8 lbs. of meat in my smoker, on about 8 racks all stacked on top of each other about a inch apart. I smoke/cook for about 8 hours, adding three new tin foil logs about every hour or hour and a half, when they stop smoking. The meat around the edges tends to get done faster, then the stuff in the middle, but I generaly seperate the well done stuff from the perfectly done stuff when I remove it all at once... I eat the well done stuff nearly imediately, and save the other stuff for later, or give some away... I find it keeps in zip lock bags in the fridge nearly indefintly or if your really concerned about it spoiling, it freezes extreemly well too. I have also dryed some out in a dehydrator and kept it un-refrigerated for more then a week and then ate it without any adverse effects.(but it's too dry to taste really good). Hot pepper water.... I purchase habanaros periodicy at the store for about $2 a pound and I dry them in my dehydrator.(I may soon be trying to smoke some) I grind/crush the dryed habanaros and put them in bottles to use later. I have about 10 cups worth of them around now... I use about a 1/4 cup of dryed crushed habanaros in my hot peper water... I just boil them in the water and then strain out the rehydrated peper remnents because I don't want that stuff clinging to my jerky... Be extreemly carefull when making and using this hot pepper water... it can be very potent, and the steam from the boiling water can really be quite unforgiving to your lungs if you inhale a deep breath of it... You may even want to do this outdoors if you have housemates(I don't). Don't get any of this stuff near any sensitive areas of your body... That's basicly my method for making what I generaly call HOT/Sweet Jerky. You could use crushed red pepper insted of habanaros... Everyone I have ever given my jerky too, loves it, some complain it's a bit too hot, and sometime I'd agree... Some say it's a bit sweet( I might agree with that too sometimes) I rarely follow any real recipies, so most of my stuff comes out slightly differnt every time...

    <title>Another Deep Fried Ice Cream</title>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Box of unsweetened cornflakes, crunched to dust (or as near as you can get!)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar 2 tb ground cinnamon 4 eggs, well beaten Ice cream Ok, the night before you want to make this (or in the morning...), take the ice cream and scoop it into balls (tennis ball size). Make sure the balls of ice cream are solid, no air pockets. You will likely have to use your hands. Place them in a shallow pan that you can put into the freezer (lined with wax paper). Freeze overnight, or at least 6 hours. Next, combine the crushed cornflakes, sugar and cinnamon in a large (gallon size) ziplock bag. Put the beaten eggs into a bowl. Take the ice cream balls and coat them with the cornflake mixture, really pressing it into the surface of the ball. Then, dip the whole thing into the egg mixture and re-coat it with cornflakes. Return to the freezer for at least 2 hours. Make sure there are no "bald spots" anywhere on the ice cream ball. You might need to dip into the egg and re-coat with the cornflakes one more time. Freeze for at LEAST 2 hours before you are going to fry. Use a good deep fryer, and heat it to a fairly high temperature (I don't know exactly how hot this is, I never measured....). Immediately before you want to serve, remove one ice cream ball from the freezer at a time, and drop into the hot oil (use canola....) for about 30 seconds, or until it just begins to brown. Take it out of the oil and put in a bowl to serve. Top with really good stuff like hot fudge (lots....really lots...oh, sorry, I'm thinking about this too much), whipped cream, nuts, anything else that you might deem appropriate. The shell should be cooked and crunchy, and the inside will still be frozen (amazing, isn't it?). You can only cook one at a time, so if you have a whole bunch to make, use more than one fryer. Let the oil return to the high temperature before you add the next ball. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #196 Date: Sun, 14 Jul 1996 00:59:07 -0500 From: pickell@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell)</li>

To Serve: Stick skewered savories into a large, round, domed loaf of bread (a purple cabbage works well also). Arrange greens under the loaf on a large, wooden board or platter. This becomes a conversation piece and a way for guests to try new taste combinations. Make sure all items are well drained before spearing them into the bread. Leave a small dish for discarded toothpicks. NOTES : I made this for the MUUF Pledge Dinner.

    <title>Ann Criswell's Pumpkin Cheesecake</title>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>4 packages (8-ounce) light cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Firmly packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 Eggs, (or 2 eggs, plus 2 egg whites)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1 can (30-ounce) pumpkin pie mix (see note)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Chopped pecans or walnuts</li>
      <li>Maple syrup</li>
      <li>Whipped cream</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CRUST</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Graham cracker crumbs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Melted butter or diet margarine</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Firmly packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Not tried and true, no representations made, but here's a pumpkin cheesecake recipe that happened to be in the Houston paper today, by Ann Criswell, Houston Chronicle. If anybody tries it let me know whether to keep it or chunk it (gotta big pile of stuff on top my computer too). Prepare crust; refrigerate until ready to fill. Soften unwrapped cream cheese in microwave at medium power 2 minutes. Beat cream cheese in large bowl until fluffy. Gradually add sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually add flour and pumpkin pie mix. Blend well and stir in nuts. Pour into crust-lined pan. Bake in preheated 325-degree oven 1-hour and 45-minutes, or until center feels firm when touched. Cool in pan on wire rack. Carefully run a sharp knife around edges to loosen sides so cake will not crack on top. Brush top with maple syrup. Chill completely. Remove sides of pan. When ready to serve, garnish with pecans and whipped cream or mixture of whipped topping and nonfat vanilla yogurt. Makes 10 to 12 servings. Crust: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease a 9-inch springform pan, or coat with vegetable oil spray. Combine crumbs, butter, cinnamon, sugar, and nuts. Line bottom and partly up the sides of prepared pan and refrigerate until ready to add filling. Note: To substitute canned pumpkin for pumpkin pie mix, use 1 (16-ounce) can pumpkin; increase sugar to 1 1/2 cups; use 5 eggs and 1/4 cup flour, and add 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice.

      <li>1/2 tablespoons Melted shortening</li>
      <li>1 cup Cooked rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cornmeal</li>

      <li>1 cup Milk</li>
      <li>3 Eggs, beaten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This one is from The Bread Winners Cookbook by Mel London. This recipe was given to me by an old friend in Savannah, who told me that it was a favorite breakfast bread on the plantations. * The salt, though traditional, may be eliminated if you choose to do so. Place the melted fats and the rice in a heavy saucepan, covered, over very low heat. Mix cornmeal and salt and pepper, then stir milk into beaten eggs and blend in the cornmeal. Blend together with the rice mixture and put into greased 8- or 9-inch square pan. Bake at 450 deg.F. until firm when tapped with finger and well browned on top--about 25 minutes. Cut into squares to serve. Makes 1 to 1 1/2 dozen squares. NOTE: This just looked like an interesting combination... and like something that would create a little more (or different) texture.. a fun bread. It almost sounds like it might come out a custardy bread... Posted by Kyosho Connick. Reposted by Fred Peters. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Genoise, 9-inch **</li>
      <li>2 cups Buttercream **</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Eau de Vie Framboise (raspberry brandy)</li>
      <li>1 cup Creme fraiche</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cream, heavy</li>
      <li>1 pint Strawberries</li>
      <li>Strawberry leaves, and flowers</li>
      <li>12 Fraise des bois with stems (wild strawberries) (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>** Recipes for this ingredient are elsewhere in this database. Cut one of the two 9-inch genoise in two. These "half-layers" will be the top two layers of the cake. The whole genoise will be the bottom. Sprinkle each of the three genoise layers lightly with 2 tablespoons of Framboise. Flavor 2 cups of buttercream with 1 tablespoon of Framboise. Whip the creme fraiche and heavy cream together to form stiff peaks. Add 1/4 cup of creme anglaise and 1 tablespoon Framboise and continue whipping until stiff peaks form again. If the strawberries are small, slice them in half lengthwise. If they are larger, slice them crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Spread the full thick layer of genoise (which will be the bottom of the cake) with one-third of the buttercream. Arrange sliced berries around the perimeter of the cake, with the cut side out. Continue to cover the bottom of the cake with half of the berries and spread with half of the whipped cream-creme anglaise mixture. Repeat the same process for the second layer of genoise then place the final layer on top and spread with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth nicely. With a small star tip on a pastry pipe, make an attractive border around the top of the cake with the remaining buttercream. (You can add food coloring to the buttercream at this point if desired.) Arrange the fraise des bois (wild strawberries with their stems) along the perimeter of the cake then garnish with strawberry leaves and flowers. Refrigerate for 2 - 4 hours before serving.

[The Great American Peanut Butter Book, by Larry &amp; Honey Zisman, pg 18; St. Martin's Press, New York, 1985.] [I made these last night to pack for my trip to Reno. Whatever you do, don't use creamy peanut butter! With just 1/2 cup nut butter mixed with 2 cups flour, the nut taste gets kind of lost. I used almond butter; we also used Cantbelieveitsnotbutter for the margarine. Don't round those Tbspfulls too high, as these cookies wind up a bit on the large size. I also forgot about flattening them out; oh well... What I have are chocolate chip cookies (mini-chips), with a faint almond flavor.] [If anyone knows of a BBS with the Cooking echo in Sparks or Reno NV, please let me know!

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: NORMA WRENN</li>
      <li>1 Beef heart; about 4 pounds</li>
      <li>3 large Cloves garlic; peeled</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Coarse salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cumin</li>
      <li>3 Dry red chili peppers seeded</li>
      <li>1 Dry ancho pepper; seeded</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Achiote oil</li>
      <li>2 slices To 3 slices bacon; ( 2 oz)</li>
      <li>8 8" to 10" bamboo skewers</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim any fat from the heat and remove veins and membranes. Cut into 24 cubes. Place in a bowl and set aside. With a mortar and pestle pound the garlic and salt to a paste. Add the pepper and cumin and continue pounding. Set aside. Place the seeded red chili and ancho peppers in a bowl, add the vinegar, and let soak for about 10 minutes, or until the peppers are soft. Place the softened peppers with the vinegar in a blender and puree until liquid. Add this mixture to the garlic paste and stir thoroughly. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Add the Achiote Oil and pour the mixture over the cubed meat, stirring to coat all the pieces. Let marinate, covered, at room temperature for 6 to 8 hours, or in the refrigerator overnight. Thread 3 pieces of the marinated cubes of beef heat on each of the 8 skewers, reserving the marinade, and set aside. There are two ways of cooking the beef hearts. Both methods require quick searing. 1. If barbecuing or broiling, heat 1/4 cup of the reserved marinade with 2 or 3 strips of the bacon in a saucepan over medium heat until all the liquid has evaporated and only the Achiote Oil and the fat from the bacon remain. Discard the bacon or reserve for another use. Brush the skewered meat cubes wih the flavored oil from the saucepan and barbecue them over a light layer of coals in a charcoal broiler (the coals should be burned until white ash has appeared on the surface). Or broil them in a preheated broiler (about 3 inches from the heat source) for 1 to 2 minutes on one side. Brush the beef cubes again with the flavored oil, turn the skewers, and broil for another minute or two. 2. If using a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the reserved marinade, add the bacon, and cook until the bacon is golden. Discard the bacon or reserve for another use. Place the skewered meat cubes in the pan and cook over high heat, while turning them, until the meat is seared on the outside but remains medium rare on the inside. This will take about 5 minutes. Serve the anticuchos hot. Source: Christmas Memories with Recipes, Felipe Rojas-Lombardi Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1066 by "M. Hicks" &lt;nitro_ii@email.msn.com&gt; on Jan 31, 1998</li>

      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 cup Uncooked fine bulgur wheat</li>
      <li>1 cup Soft whole-wheat bread</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Prep: Cook lentils and bay leaf in pot with 6 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils are soft and water has been absorbed, about 45 min. Combine bulgur and 2 cups water in a med. saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 15 min. Preheat oven to 350F. Transfer lentils to a large mixing bowl. Add bulgur, and remaining ingredients except tomato paste or sauce. Mix well with your hands until thoroughly combined. Pat mixture into a 9" loaf pan. Bake for 40 min. until firm but not dry. During last minutes of baking, brush top with tomato paste or sauce. Let cool for 15 min. Cut into slices and serve warm. This goes wonderfully with mashed potatoes and your favorite vegetable! The leftovers taste so good in a pita pocket, and if there are mashed potatoes leftover, I stuff the pocket with both. Mmmm! Enjoy!

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Sticks unsalted butter</li>
      <li>4 Squares (1 oz. each)</li>
      <li>Unsweetened baking chocolate</li>
      <li>I use Bakers'</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>3 Eggs, large size</li>
      <li>Vanilla extract (I prefer</li>
      <li>Madagascar Bourbon and use a</li>
      <li>Lot of it)</li>
      <li>1 cup All-purpose unbleached</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350. Melt the chocolate with 1 stick (4 oz.) of butter and the salt. Put the remaining 4 oz. unsalted butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until soft, grandually adding the sugar until well blended. Dump in the vanilla. Add next. Add the melted chocolate-butter (I prefer NOT to let it cool, but add it while it is still quite warm) and mix until well blended. (No need to wash the pan yet, for you will be using it to make the frosting.) Add the flour and mix at low speed until just blended. Turn the batter into a prepared (greased and floured 7x11-inch) baking pan and bake for 35, 45 minutes, depending on your oven and your preference for moist brownies. Cool in a baking rack. Fudge Frosting: 1 cup sugar 1 oz. unsweetened baking chocolate 1 pinch of salt 1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream* vanilla extract Gently melt the chocolate with the sugar, salt , and cream. Take care not to overstir, as it may cause the fudge to "sugar". Cook to the soft-ball stage and transfer to the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat at medium speed until it has cooled and then add the vanilla. Beat until it loses its shiny sheen and becomes thick frosting. Frost cooled brownies with the fudge frosting. *If I have whipping cream which has soured or creme fraiche on hand I prefer using them, as I like the tang they impart to the frosting. These are *very* rich. I cut them into rather small squares. Serve in a bowl with vanilla ice cream to be really, really bad. ;-) File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip</li>

    <quantity>16</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 package (8 1/2 oz) chocolate wafers; crushed (Oreos work well, filling and all)</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Unsalted butter; melted</li>
      <li>2 packages (8 oz) cream cheese; softened (low fat works well)</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>12 ounces Or 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate, melted</li>
      <li>1 cup Whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Unsalted butter; melted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Kahlua</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 325F. In medium bowl, combine wafers and butter, reserving 1 tablespoon of the crumbs for garnish. Press remaining crumbs in bottom and 2 inches up sides of an ungreased 10-inch springform pan. Refrigerate. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese and sugar; beat until smooth. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add melted chocolate; beat well. Add remaining ingredients, and beat until smooth. Pour into crust-lined pan. Bake at 325F for 55 to 65 minutes or until edges are set. Center of cheesecake will be soft. (To minimize cracking, place a shallow pan with about 3/4 inch of hot water on the lower oven rack while baking.) Allow cheesecake to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then carefully remove the sides of the pan. Allow the cheesecake to cool completely. Garnish with the reserved crumbs (provided you can keep your spouse from eating them), and refrigerate (at least 2-3 hours, preferably overnight). Keeps well in refrigerator for 3 days, probably longer, but who can keep from eating it before then?

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>2 Chickens,small*</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Mustard,dry</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups Lard</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CHICKEN GRAVY</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Light cream</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* - cut each into 8 pieces, backbone removed (save liver and gizzard for another use). 1. Wash each piece of chicken under cold running water. Pat dry with paper toweling. 2. Place flour, salt, mustard, and pepper in a large paper bag. Twist closed and shake to blend ingredients. Drop the chicken pieces into the bag a few at a time and shake the bag vigorously until each piece is thoroughly coated. Remove the chicken pieces from the bag and shake off excess flour - there will be plenty of it. Then lay them side by side on waxed paper and place them near the stove so that you can get to them easily when you start frying. 3. Preheat oven to warm and in it place a large baking dish lined with paper toweling. 4. Heat the lard in a heavy 10-12" skillet. The fat should fill the pan to a depth of about 2 inches. Add more lard if necessary. 5. Place over moderate heat and when the fat is hot but not smoking, begin frying chicken. Put in the thigh and legs first and cover the pan at once. Let the chicken fry over moderate heat, lifting the cover occasionally to check the process, and when deep brown turn - with a wooden spoon, so you don't pierce the skin. Cover and brown the other side. As each piece is cooked, remove it, place it in the warm oven, and put an uncooked piece in its place. 6. Cook all of the chicken in the same way. Just remember that the white meat will take a little less time to cook than the dark pieces. 7. Leave the chicken in the oven while preparing the gravy. *** CHICKEN GRAVY *** 1. Pour the frying fat from the pan, replace it with the butter, melt, then stir in the flour. When bubbly, stir in the stock and cream, and cook until sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Serve the sauce separately to spoon over the chicken pieces at the table.</li>

      <li>2 cups Crisp wheat square cereal</li>
      <li>2 cups Chedar cheese-flavored goldfish crackers</li>
      <li>1 3/4 ounces Can shoestring potatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted peanuts</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Margarine or butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried parsley flakes</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Chili powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Onion powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>MICROWAVE INSTRUCTIONS: Prepare popcorn as directed on the packaged. Remove any unpopped kernels. In a large bowl, combine popcorn, cereal, crackers, shoestring poatoes and peanuts. Place margarine in a 2-cup microwave-safe measuring cup. Microwave on high for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until melted. Stir in parsley flakes, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder. Drizzle seasoned mixture over popcorn mixture. Sprinkle with cheese. Toss until evenly coated. Transfer half of mixture to ungreased 12x8 inch microwave safe dish. Microwave on HIGH for 3 minutes or until thorougly heated, stirring once halfway through heating. Spread on paper towels to cool. Repeat with remaining mixture. Makes 12 cups. The garlic in this popcorn keeps vampires from getting too friendly! Another way people used to keep vampires away was to scatter mustard seeds on their roofs. Supposedly if a vampire saw some mustard seeds he would have to stop and count each one. People scattered so many mustard seeds on their roofs that it would take all night for the vampire to count them. By that time it was dawn and the vampire had to return to its grave.

    <quantity>96</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>4 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups Unbleached flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. With an electric mixer (even the hand-held kind), cream together butter and sugar. Add egg yolks and vanilla and mix well. Sift flour and salt together and beat into butter mixture until well mixed. When ready to bake use an ungreased cookie sheet and place cookies 1 inch apart. Bake for about 10 minutes, but do not brown them. Remove cookies from cookie sheet while still warm and cool on sheets of waxed paper. Decorate, if you like. Makes 6 to 8 dozen. Taste fabulous! Shapes: Candy Canes: Divide 3 cups of dough in half. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons red food coloring to one half. Using about a tablespoon of dough, roll a 4 inch strip of each color (no fatter than a pencil). Place the two colored rolls side-by-side and press lightly together. Gently twist like a rope and place on ungreased cookie sheet 1 inch apart. Curve the top like a candy cane and bake about 10 minutes; do not brown. You can sprinkle with crushed peppermint candy. Rolled Cookies: Shape dough into rolls with width of a cookie. Wrap in waxed paper and chill. Before baking, roll in chocolate shots. Slice 1/2 inch thick and bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 10 minutes; do no brown. Stars, Hearts, Circles and Jelly-Filled: Fill a pastry bag with unchilled dough and put through a 'star tip' (sizes 2 and 7 - 9). Squeeze onto cookie sheet into the shapes you like. For instance, make star, then fill baked cookie center with red jelly. Decorate these cookies with cinnamon hearts, mini chocolate morsels, color sugar, little silver balls, or frosting from a tube. Bake them, same as others. Do not brown. Cookie Cutter Cookies: Chill dough. Roll out onto lightly floured board to thickness of 1/2 inch. Cut with cookie cutters and bake as mentioned above. Decorate your own way. Plain Old Drop Cookies: Just drop unchilled dough by teaspoonful onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Don't brown. Remove from pans immediately.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Saute the onion, peppers, hot peppers, and garlic until the onions are translucent. Add all other ingrediants and simmer a minimum of 30 minutes (about how long corn bread takes to cook ;-). Add water if chili is too thick. Adjust seasonings during cooking to taste. That's it! Last night's batch had TVP, 1 can pinto beans, 2 cans kidney beans, 1 can black eye peas, so I used double the spices and the higher amounts of the rest of the ingrediants. Very tasty last night and of course even better today for lunch. Posted by Cynthia Grall &lt;grall@la.tis.com&gt; to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 11 Issue 13], Oct. 13, 1994.

After a few minutes, stir in stock &amp; pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes. Add salt if desired. Serve with croutons. Source Unknown One word of advice, though...it calls for one whole cup of garlic for one quart of stock in this recipe. My wife made this recipe, and I'd *definitely* recommend using less garlic than it calls for...probably around 1/2 cup at the most. We added more tomatoes than the recipe called for.

      <li>Fill up with water to cover veggies. Since I wasn't using a prepared sauce as I usually do, I threw in every dried green herb I had in the house: oregano, thyme, rosemary, marjoram - about a tsp of each. Mixed well and set the crockpot going on low. This was on Thursday night. On Friday morning I added about a cup of the dried Beef-Not and mixed well. By the time we came to eat it the Beef-Not was thoroughly cooked and had lost all vestiges of a soy-like taste, and the water was well absorbed (a problem sometimes with my cholents). You can order Beef-Not (and Chicken-Not and heaven knows what else) from Dixie Diner's Club by phoning 1-800-BEEF-NOT. I have no affiliation with them whatsoever. Watch out - the catalogue has hechshers for many products, but I found that one of them didn't have the hechsher on the product when I actually ordererd it 8-(.

      <li>SAUCES: IN a blender, combine strawberries, 1/2 cup honey, and 1 Tbsp arrowroot or cornstarch. Puree until smooth. Pour into a saucepan and heat, whisking, until slightly thickened. Pour into a bowl to let cool. Press kiwifruit through a strainer to remove seeds. In a blender, combine strained kiwifruit with remaining 1 Tbsp arrowroot or cornstarch and 1/2 cup honey. PUree until smooth. Pour sauce into a clean saucepan and heat, whisking, until slightly thickened. Pour into a bowl to let cool. TO SERVE: Ladle a small amount of red sauce on half of a dessert plate, and an equal amount of green sauce on the other half. Place a slice of cake in the center and drizzle with stripes of the two sauces and chunks of kiwifruit if desired. Serve immediately. SERVES 12. HELPFUL HINT: The trick to a successful angel-food cake is the lightness of the beaten egg whites, so fold them quickly into the batter before they have a chance to separate.

Add the water and gather into a ball. 2. Divide in 2 and pat each half into a 12x3 strip on a cookie sheet. (It's important to make them 12 inches long and you can put them side by side on the same cookie sheet.) 3. In a medium saucepan, heat the margarine and water of Dough 2 and bring to a boil. Add the almond extract and remove from heat. 4. Immediately stir in the flour and mix until smooth. 5. Add the eggs, one at a time, combining thoroughly after each addition. (This is just like a cream puff dough and takes a little muscle to combine.) 6. Spread the mixture evenly over each strip. Bake at 350 for 60 minutes. 7. When partially cool, drizzle with icing.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here, beef brisket takes on an Asian flare. Slices of meat are braised in an aromatic stock seasoned with star anise, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, red pepper and dark molasses. As a final step, pureed eggplant is stirred in, for flavor and thickening. Pierce the eggplant several times with the tines of a fork. Place in a preheated 400F oven and roast for 3 minutes, or until shriveled and soft. Set aside. Slice the brisket against the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Heat the oil in a large wok or large deep skillet. When it begins to smoke, add half of the beef and cook, stirring, until browned. Remove and set aside.

      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Despite their nauseating title, these roasted peppers are one of my sister's better efforts! Roast peppers under broiler, turning once (at about 5 mins) to ensure both sides become charred. Place broiled peppers in brown paper bag and close over (Tupperware, et al works fine, too). Let steam, sealed, or about 15-20 mins. Peel, seed and cut the slimy buggers into long, thin slices, then place in marinade. Marinate 30 mins or so, and serve on a bed of your favorite salad greens.

      <li>2 cups Cake flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Walnut pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Anise seeds</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups White sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Lemon zest</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Orange zest</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Anise extract</li>
      <li>8 ounces Bittersweet or semisweet</li>
      <li>Chocolate, optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Blend bread and cake flours, walnuts, baking powder, baking soda and anise seeds in bowl. Melt butter and set aside to cool. Beat 2 eggs, 1 additional egg yolk and sugar until smooth. Reserve the remaining egg white. Stir in zests and anise. Add butteer and mix until smooth. Add dry ingredients and mix to smooth dough. Roll dough into 2 14inch logs and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Press tops of logs to flatten slightly. Brush with reserved egg white. Bake at 375 degrees F. until logs are light brown, but still give slightly when tops are pressed, about 30 minutes. Remove pan from oven and reduce temperature to 325 degrees. While logs are still warm, cut diagonally into 1/2 inch slices. Return slices to baking sheet, placing on sides. Return to oven and bake until cookies are lightly brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks. Cut chocolate into 1/2 inch chunks. Place 2/3 in stainless steel bowl, spreading in even layer over bottom and up sides of bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Fill medium saucepan 1/3 full of water. Bring water to simmer over high heat. Remove pan from heat and set bowl of chocolate over top. Let stand until 80% of the chocolate has melted. Do not let temperature of chocolate drop below 88 degrees on candy thermometer. If so, place bowl over saucepan of warm water and continue stirring. Stir until chocolate is smooth and glossy. Have clean sheet of waxed paper nearby. Dip 1/2 of each cookie in chocolate. As cookie is removed, scrape top and bottom against side of bowl to remove excess chocolate. Set cookies on waxed paper until chocolate sets, about 3 hours or put into freezer for about 20 minutes.

      <li>1 3/4 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Beat eggs until fluffy in mixer bowl at medium speed. gradually beat in sugar. Continue beating 20 minutes more ( a must ). At low speed blend in flour, baking powder and salt. Add anise extract and beat only to blend. Drop by teaspoonful on greased and floured baking sheets about 1/2 inch apart. Swirl each to make a circular form. You can bake these two ways. Either let stand on baking sheets for 8 hours at room temperature ( to dry out ) or bake immediately. Either way bake at 325 degrees about 10 minutes or until firm looking or set. cool on rack and store airtight. If made the first way to dry out these are a coffee dunker cookie or if baked immediately they are much softer and delicate.Either way they are delicious. I bake mine the second way.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat baking sheet with non-stick spray or parchment. In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, anise seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together egg equivalents, lemon zest, and lemon juice, and add to the dry ingredients. Mix well. Working on a floured surface, shape dough into two logs, each about 14 inches long and 1-1/2 inches thick. Set the logs on prepared baking sheet, at least 4 inches apart (the dough will spread during baking). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm to the touch. Transfer the logs to the rack to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Cut the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices, using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion. Stand the slices on their sides on the baking sheet and return to the oven. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing. Biscotti will crisp as they cool. Store, in an air-tight container, up to one month. Makes about 4 dozen biscotti. note: I made 43 cookies, about 40 cal, &lt; 1 g fat each, but it depends on what you use for the "egg" &gt; From: Christina Hulbe &lt;chulbe@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu&gt;.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Prozac90mg@aol.com Date: Fri, 5 Jul 1996 06:35:45 -0400 Did you know that you can substitute plain applesauce for the oil in many recipes? You can... try it next time you make a packaged cake or brownie mix. This recipe is a good one. The riper the bananas, the better. You can save old, soft, peeled bananas in the freezer until you want to make these delicious muffins. You can also add chopped nuts, raisins, carob or chocolate chips or any other surprise treat ! EQUIPMENT: Big mixing bowl, potato masher, measuring spoons and cups, muffin pan and muffin papers. METHOD: HEAToven to 375 degrees. MASH the bananas in the big mixing bowl with the potato masher. ADD the sugar, eggs and applesauce and mix well. STIR baking soda into yogurt or sour cream and it will become foamy which makes the muffins rise. ADD the flour and wheat germ and stir until just mixed (muffins won't rise if you overmix). SPOON mixture into muffin papers in muffin pan. BAKE about 10 -15 minutes until done.

    <title>Anise Lemon Biscotti</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Unbleached white flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Talt</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Whole eggs</li>
      <li>1 Egg white</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Ground anise seeds</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>These recipes were taken from the "Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites" Cookbook. I haven't made them, so I don't know about their quality, but, being from Moosewood, I'd count on them being fabulous! Mangia!!! The directions are the same, except that this is a wetter dough. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray or a very light coating of oil. In a large mixing bow, sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Lightly beat the eggs and add them to the flour mixture. Stir in the maple syrup, vanilla, and walnuts, mixing just until the dough is smooth. Using a rubber spatula and floured hands, scoop half of the dough out of the bowl and onto one side of the baking sheet. Shape the dough into a 15" long log. Make a second log on the other side of the baking tray with the remaining dough. Space the logs at least 6" apart. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the top of each biscotti log is firm. Remove them with a long spatula to a wire rack and cool for 10-15 minutes. Cut each log on a severe diagonal into about 20 1/2" thick slices and place them, cut side down, on the baking sheet. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 15 minutes. Hot from the oven, the biscotti might be slightly soft in the center, but they will harden as they cool. Allow them to cool completely. Stored in a tin or other tightly closed container, they will keep for at least a couple of weeks.

      <li>1/2 cups Confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter; softened</li>

      <li>Ingredient Group: SECOND LAYER</li>
      <li>2 cups Confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Instant coffee crystals dissolved in</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Hot water</li>
      <li>1 Egg; lightly beaten, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter; softened</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Milk</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: TOP LAYER</li>
      <li>4 ounces White chocolate; 4 squares</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
      <li>2 ounces Semisweet chocolate;2 sq-opt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350F. FIRST LAYER: Grease 8 inch square cake pan with butter. Mix together thoroughly flour, confectioner's sugar (icing sugar), softened butter and coffee dissolved in hot water. (You can use food processor or electric mixer). Press mixture evenly into pan bottom. Bake 10 minutes in preheated 350F oven. Cool on wire rack. SECOND LAYER: Meanwhile in large bowl, combine confectioner's sugar (icing sugar), 1 Tbsp coffee crystals dissolved in 2 Tbsp hot water, softened butter and 1 egg (lightly beaten with a fork at room temperature.) Mix until thoroughly combined. (can use food processor or electric mixer). Put milk in pot over medium heat and scald (heat until bubbles appear around sides but milk is not a rolling boil). Add mixture from bowl and heat 7 minutes over medium heat , stirring frequently at first, constantly after the mixture bubbles. (If mixture starts to stick on bottom, lower heat slightly). Let cool slightly, then pour over first layer. Tilt pan to cover base layer evenly. Chill in refrigerator half an hour or more till set. THIRD LAYER: Combine 4 oz white chocolate with 1 Tbsp butter in double boiler and melt (or melt 1 -1 1/2 minutes in microwave on High and stir ). Spread over chilled second layer with spatula or blunt knife (layer will be quite thin). OPTIONAL MARBLED EFFECT: Melt 2 oz semisweet chocolate in double boiler (or in microwave 1 - 1 1/2 minutes on High and stir). Pour melted semisweet chocolate into small ziploc bag and seal. Snip corner of bag with scissors. Squeeze out horizontal lines of semisweet chocolate onto white chocolate layer. With a blunt knife, swirl the two chocolates together to create a marbled effect. Chill. Before the third layer is completely set, score into bars. VARIATION: Mocha Squares: substitute semisweet chocolate for white chocolate (this variation is easier as the middle layer and semisweet chocolate are similar in colour.) MAKES: approx 32 bars (they are very sweet, therefore the bars should be small) From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>here is something else I threw together last night (open the fridge, see what's left and use it all up...), while it came out very tasty I think it will probably need a bit of refinement - I would appreciate comments from those of you experienced with making meatloaf.... This is that I did: With my food food processor attachment I finely minced the turkey, mushrooms, onion and garlic. Mixed those well with egg; salt and pepper to taste. Places it in an 1 lb loaf pan and baked at 400oF for about 35 mins until done. While it was very tasty (and had a lovely strong mushroom flavour) I think the non-mushroomephiles might prefer it with the mushroom quantity halved or the meat doubled. Also it could do with more 'cohesion' (?), it was rather crumbly - I would have added a slice of bread, also minced, but we had run out of bread. Do you thing that would have made any difference? I served it with tomato sauce made from pureed plum tomates, which complemented it really well. EAT-L DIGEST 13 JUNE 1996 From the EAT-L recipe list.

      <li>1 tablespoon Dry)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat baking sheet with non-stick spray or parchment. In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, anise seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together egg equivalents, lemon zest, and lemon juice, and add to the dry ingredients. Mix well. Working on a floured surface, shape dough into two logs, each about 14 inches long and 1-1/2 inches thick. Set the logs on prepared baking sheet, at least 4 inches apart (the dough will spread during baking). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm to the touch. Transfer the logs to the rack to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Cut the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices, using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion. Stand the slices on their sides on the baking sheet and return to the oven. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing. Biscotti will crisp as they cool. Store, in an air-tight container, up to one month. Makes about 4 dozen biscotti. from _Eating Well_ magazine (modified) note: I made 43 cookies, about 40 cal, &lt; 1 g fat each, but it depends on what you use for the "egg" From: Christina Hulbe &lt;chulbe@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu&gt;.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>http://www.santesson.com/recept/favlist.htm "Allt om Mat" is a leading Swedish food magazine. We were immensely proud when it published our recipe for Anna cutlets in the early 1970s. (We also appreciated when the magazine, 25 years later, included a link to our recipe collection - see AoM #17, 1997.) It is a very convenient dish, can be prepared long in advance with everything contained in one pot. 1.Fry the mushroom slices briefly in a hot frying-pan. 2.Place the pork cuts in a buttered gratin dish and cover them with the mushrooms, then put the potato slices on top in a even layer. 3.Use salt and pepper as desired, then top with very thin slices of butter. 4.Cook in the oven at 200 - 225 oC for 45 minutes. Serve together with a tomato-lettuce-cucumber salad. Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW &lt;shusky@erols.com&gt; on Feb 17, 1998</li>

    <title>Angu (Cornmeal Mush)</title>

    <category>Brazil</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>INGREDIENTS:</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
      <li>2 Clove garlic, minced (2 tsp)</li>
      <li>1 small Onion, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)</li>
      <li>2 cups Cold water (to 3 cups)</li>
      <li>Salt &amp; fresh ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fine (stone ground) cornmeal</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Servings: 6 to 8 Notes: Angu (pronounced "aing goo") is a sort of polenta, one of the many cooked starch pastes one finds in Brazil. For best results, use a fine, stone ground cornmeal. DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Cook the garlic and onion over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add 2 cups water and bring to a rapid boil. Add the cornmeal in a thin stream through your fingers, stirring vigorously to prevent lumps. The mixture should be the consistency of choux pastry or soft ice cream. If too thick, make a hole in the angu with a wooden spoon and stir in a little cold water. Reduce the heat to low and gently simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Correct the seasoning and serve at once. Note: For a prettier presentation, the angu can be spooned into a thickly buttered tube pan and unmolded onto a platter. (Picture in magazine shows that a fluted tube pan was used, and the center of the unmolded angu was filled with flat leaf parsley- or cilantro?

    <quantity>3</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground anise seed (or 1 ts anise extract)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 large Lemon</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>5 3/16 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 Egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar (for decoration)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cinnamon (for decor.)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Thoroughly stir together flour, anise, baking powder, and slat and set aside. Using a small sharp knife peel a thin layer of zest (without white membrane) from the entire lemon. Combine lemon zest and sugar in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process until zest is very finely minced. Add shortening and butter to the processor and process for one minute. Add egg yolk and vanilla and process 20 seconds longer. Add dry ingredients and continue processing just until they are blended. Divide dough in half and place each portion between large sheets of waxed paper and roll out to 1/8 inch thick. Check the underside of the dough to check for any creases. Slide dough onto a large tray or baking sheet and refrigerate for 15 minutes, or until the dough is chilled and slightly firm. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease several baking sheets. Work one half of the dough at at time. Turn the dough over and peel the sheet of wax paper off of the dough and replace the paper loosely. Then turn the dough right side up. Peel off and discard the top sheet of paper. Using assorted 2 1/4 to 3" cookie cutters cut out cookies. Place in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes or until just brown ant the edges. Remove from the oven and let stand for 3 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let stand until cooled completely. Sprinkle cookies with the decoration mixture.

    <title>Anise-Almond Biscotti</title>
    <category/>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 cups Whole almonds</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter; softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Eggs; lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Anise seeds</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To toast almonds, preheat oven to 350øF. Spread almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool, then roughly chop. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt in a small mixing bowl. Set aside. Cream butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large mixing bowl until fluffy; then beat in eggs and vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture, mix until combined, then stir in chopped almonds and anise seeds. Dough will be stiff. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface, then, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape into one long roll, about 3 inches by 13 inches. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil (shiny side up). Transfer dough roll to baking sheet, flatten slightly, then bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven--do not turn oven off--and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut roll, on the diagonal, into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place slices flat on baking sheet and bake, turning once, until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Do not over bake: Biscotti will feel soft in the middle but will become crisp and hard as they cool. Allow to cool completely on pan. Biscotti will keep in a sealed container for up to 4 weeks.

      <li>Newsgroups: rec.food.recipes From: morrissey@stsci.edu (Mostly Harmless) Janet Morrissey From: pattee_d@cubldr.colorado.edu Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Toast the almonds until golden, then chop by hand into 1/4 inch chunks. *Reduce oven heat to *325* degrees* Cream the butter until light, add the sugar and beat till smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs until the mixture is smooth. Add the (orange, anise, lemon) specific ingredients. Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt, beat until just mixed. Stir in the almonds. On a floured board, divide the dough in half and roll each half into a long roll about 1-1/2 inches in diameter and about 10 inches long. Set the rolls on a baking sheet at least 3 inches apart, bake in the top third of the oven (*325*) for about 25 minutes, or until they are set and lightly browned on top. Cool the rolls for 5 minutes or so, then slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Lay the slices flat on the baking sheet and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Turn the slices over and bake for another 10 minutes. Cool on a rack, and keep in a tightly covered tin - they keep for months. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /COOKIES From rec.food.cooking archives.

Coat baking sheet with non-stick spray or parchment. In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, anise seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together egg equivalents, lemon zest, and lemon juice, and add to the dry ingredients. Mix well. Working on a floured surface, shape dough into two logs, each about 14 inches long and 1-1/2 inches thick. Set the logs on prepared baking sheet, at least 4 inches apart (the dough will spread during baking). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm to the touch. Transfer the logs to the rack to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Cut the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices, using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion. Stand the slices on their sides on the baking sheet and return to the oven. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing. Biscotti will crisp as they cool. Store, in an air-tight container, up to one month. Makes about 4 dozen biscotti.

      <li>From: sybel@ix.netcom.com (Ruth Donenfeld) Date: Fri, 9 Aug 1996 08:51:59 -0700 Dough: put dough on kneading board; make a well. In center of well add eggs, water and salt. Using your hands, mix in the eggs, breaking the yolks as you go, and as you mix, you add more and more of the flour to the center and knead for 10 minutes. (Or just put it in the mixer and knead for 5 minutes. Add more flour if mix becomes sticky. This is a good noodle dough. Form it into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap or foil. Let rest at room temp for 30 minutes. Filling: melt chicken fat, add onions, saute until soft and opaque. DO NOT LET BURN. If using the beef, add and cook until it turns grey. Remove from heat, add parsley, salt and pepper. If using chicken, just add to onions and seasonings. To make kreplach: Cut dough ball in thirds for easier handling. Keep unused parts covered until using. Roll dough out on floured board until it is very thin, about 1/8 inch. Trim off rough edges. Cut dough into 2 1/2 inch squares. Place about a teaspoon filling into center of each square. Fold dough in half to make a triangle. Moisten edges and pinch to seal. Repeat this with the rest of the dough and fillings. Let kreplach sit on a floured board for 15-20 minutes before cooking them in a large pot of salted, boiling water. Cook for 20 minutes, drain and broil to brown them. Or cook them for 25 minutes and serve immediately in chicken soup. Or instead of boiling, fry in hot oil to be served as appetizers. JEWISH-FOOD digest 310 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

      <li>Here's one you might like. It's from a recipe obtained from a coworker's spouse. I've tasted the cookies, and liked them enough to ask for this recipe. 1. Grease and flour three cookie sheets. 2. In large bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed, beat eggs until very thick and light. 3. Gradually beat in sugar. Continue beating 20 minutes longer. 4. At low speed, beat in flour, baking powder, salt; beat 1 minute. Add anise extract; beat just until blended. 5. Drop by teaspoonfuls, 1/2 inch apart, on prepared cookie sheets. Swirl each, to make into a circle. 6. Let stand at room temperature, uncovered, 8 hours, or overnight. 7. Preheat oven to 325F. Bake cookies about 10 minutes, or until smooth and firm when pressed with fingertip. Cool cookies on wire rack. Then store in airtight container. Makes about 5 dozen.

      <li>One standard seasoning Mrs. Jachimowicz uses is fried onions. She usually makes a large quantity at once so she can add it to each dish without preparing it each time. After finely chopping the onions, she browns them with a little flour in vegetable oil. When they are golden, she melts some butter in the pan. The oil prevents the onions from burning and the butter is added for flavor. She also seasons most of her foods with seasoned salt, celery salt or savory.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 quart Heavy cream</li>
      <li>8 large Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 large Vanilla bean, slit open lengthwise</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds White chocolate, chopped (about 1 1/2 cup)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Scald 2 cups of the cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat, just until the milk gives off steam and bubbles begin to form around the edge. Remove the pan from the heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they have a pale lemon hue. Add the sugar and continue to whisk until dissolved. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup of the scalded cream. When the mixture is thoroughly blended, whisk it into the scalded cream in the saucepan. Add the vanilla bean. Return the saucepan to low heat and whisk the cream constantly for about 5 minutes, until it has thickened and reached a temperature of 178 to 180F, as registered on an instant-read or a dairy thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat. Remove the vanilla bean from the pan, then whisk in the white chocolate, until it is melted and thoroughly incorporated. Scrape out the inside of the vanilla bean with the back of a knife and add these flecks to the pan. Whisk in the remaining cream. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. Prepare the ice cream in an ice-cream maker according to manufacturer's directions. Store the ice cream in the freezer, where it has a shelf life of about 1 week.

      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>fennel plant, which resembles celery with fern like tops, has been called sweet anise in produce markets. The true anise is cultivated only for its seeds. So what you see labelled "sweet anise" in your market is probably fennel, but no matter what you call it, this is a highly interesting vegetable. Every part of this aromatic plant has a taste and aroma similar to licorice. The stems are eaten like celery,uncook, or cooked and served as a vegetable (heavenly with apples in waldorf salad) Available from September to May. HOW TO CHOOSE AND STORE: Choose fennel the same way you do celery, with crisp stalks and fresh leaves. Wash and store in vegetable crisper or plastic bag in refrigerator. BASIC PREPARATION: Trim the ferny tops and remove tough outer stalks. Cut off heavy base. Slice the stalks in thin lengthwise strips. Wash,drain and cook in boiling, salted water or bouillon until just tender,15-20 minutes. Drain and add melted butter, salt and pepper and serve.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F with rack in center of oven. Generously grease 2 8-inch layer cake pans. Dust with flour, tapping pans over sink to remove excess flour. FOR CAKE, sift flour, baking powder and salt together onto waxed paper; set aside. Use mixer to cream shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Combine well. Add reserved flour mixture alternately with milk, mixing until smooth. Divide batter between prepared pans. Use back of spoon to spread batter evenly; this takes a little patience. FOR MERINGUE, beat egg whites until they are thick and hold their shape but are still soft and moist. Add sugar by the tablespoon, beating well after each addition. Divide between pans. Use spatula to spread over batter. Sprinkle with nuts, dividing evenly. Bake until lightly colored and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean (it's OK if meringue cracks), about 30 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes in pans on cooling racks. Use flexible knife to release cake from sides of pan. Gently invert cakes. Set them meringue-side up to cool completely. Spread one meringue layer with filling. Top with other layer, meringue-side up. It's best served the day it is made but it can be made a day ahead and kept cool (but not refrigerated). If made ahead, keep covered. Yield: 1 8-inch layer cake. VANILLA CUSTARD FILLING: Combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in heavy 1-quart saucepan. Stir in egg yolk and milk. Stir over medium heat. Stir until mixture coats spoon, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Let cool completely. If mixture becomes lumpy, whisk vigorously, before using.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Egg whites</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Ground anise seeds</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after- dinner dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy, but if you prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn off the oven and, with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to an hour. These cookies are generally baked on parchment paper, but we have found that regular bond paper makes a very acceptable substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar. Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise. Using pastry bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275 degrees F. 30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue is desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 0 fat; 2 grams carbohydrates; 0 protein; trace fiber.</li>

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Almonds, blanched</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Soy milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Seasoned salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Soy milk</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Oil, sunflower</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cider vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Water can be substituted for soy milk. Process almonds to fine powder in blender or food processor. Add soy milk, yeast, garlic powder, and salt. Blend well, then add remaining soy milk to form smooth cream. With blender running on low, remove insert in top and drizzle in oil in thin stream until mixture is thick. Keep blender running and add lemon juice and vinegar. Blend on low for 1 minute longer, to allow mixture to thicken to desired consistency. Refrigerate tightly sealed; this will keep 10-14 days in refrigerator. Yields 1-1/2 to 2 cups Note: Do not be discouraged if, on occasion, your Almonnaise does not thicken to your expectations. Homemade mayonnaise products are among the most sensitive to prepare, and sometimes they just don't respond. This recipe has been made successfully by many people, but once in a while it fails even for me [the author of The American Vegetarian Cookbook]. For every failure, however, I've had hundreds of successes that make it worth the small risk. -from The American Vegetarian Cookbook Posted by J.PRINCE13 [Dale] MM by Sylvia Steiger, GEnie THE.STEIGERS, CI$ 71511,2253, GT Cookbook echo moderator at net/node 004/005 From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* firmly packed ** (2 1/2 - 3 cups) These cookies go well with after dinner coffee or tea. In a bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, salt and baking soda and set aside. In a large bowl, cream the butter. Add the coffee, almond extract, granulated and brown sugars and beat well. Add the eggs one at a time until smooth after each addition. On low speed gradually add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until the mixture is smooth. Gently mix in the almonds. Spread out two pieces of wax paper. place large spoonfuls of the dough lengthwise on each piece of paper to form heavy strips about 10-11 inches long. Fold the long sides of the paper p against the dough and, pressing against the paper with your hands, shape each strip of dough into a smooth oblong 12 inches long, 3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. Wrap the dough in the wax paper. Slide a cookie sheet under both packages of dough and transfer them to the freezer or refrigerator for several hours or overnight. This slices best when dough is frozen solid. Preheat oven to 375ø. Unwrap one roll of dough at a time. Place dough on a cutting board. With a very sharp knife cut the dough into 1/4-inch slices and place them 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes at 375ø. The cookies are done when they are slightly colored and spring back when lightly pressed with a fingertip. Yield: 4 dozen.

      <li>And without further teasing, here is the "Almost-Dreamland" reacipe which was concocted by a writer for "Men's Journal" that is declared to be very close to the real recipe by Ms. Bishop-Hall: In a large saucepan, whisk together tomato puree and mustard until smooth. Stir in remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve warm. Sauce may be refrigerated for several weeks. Note: I am not financially attached either to the Birmingham News (I do have a subscription for which I pay) nor Dreamland Barbeque (though I have been seen eating at both locations occasionally).

Plump the dried cherries by soaking them in boiling water to cover for a couple of minutes. Drain well and toss with cherry brandy. Let the cherries sit in the brandy for a couple of hours, or even overnight for the best flavor, then drain before using. Cream the butter with both sugars. Blend in the egg, vanilla and almond extracts. Fold in the salt, baking soda and flour. Fold in the cherries, white and dark chocolate and, if using, the macadamia nuts. Batter should be soft. Drop in generous tablespoons onto the baking sheets, leaving space between dollops of batter. Bake until lightly browned around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on racks. (Makes about 2 1/2 dozen).

      <li>3/4 cups Brown sugar (packed)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter or margarine (butter makes it richer)</li>
      <li>1/2 packages (6 oz size) semisweet chocolate chips. (1/2 cup)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and it is real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it by herself at christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet your needs. It comes from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have it on hand already. Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan. Heat sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the last minute or two). Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in pan. Sprinkle chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet over pan so contained heat will melt chocolate. Spread melted chocolate over canndy. While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares. chill until firm. Now for the changes we use. When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2 cup of chocolate in the microwave. Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan that is covered with the nuts. After the chocolate is spread on top, sprinkle more nuts on top, while chocolate is still warm. Then cut into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from the pan and wrap individually with desert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply, or a craft shop.

      <li>Combine the skim milk, milk powder, cocoa, and sugar in a 3-quart stainless steel saucepan. Bring to a boil on high heat, stirring constantly. Lower heat to prevent the mixture from boiling over. Add the cornstarch mixture gradually while stirring at the same time. When the milk thickens to the consistency of cake batter, which happens almost immediately, remove and set aside. (If the milk does not thicken easily, add 1 Tbl. cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbl. cold milk.) Stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the mixture into a fancy serving dish and allow to cool. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours to enable the pudding to set. When the pudding feels firm (test by tipping the bowl gently), garnish with cherries or your favorite fat-free topping. Serve.

      <li>2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted butter; cut into 16 slices</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: TOPPING</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Mild-tasting honey</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Light brown sugar; packed</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Heavy cream</li>
      <li>8 ounces Slivered almonds</li>
      <li>8 ounces Unblanched whole almonds; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Grated orange rind</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. CRUST (first 5 ingredients) Place the flour, confectioners' sugar and salt into the bowl of a food processor. Blend for a few seconds. (Keep your hand over the top of the feed tube so the sugar won't fly away.) Then scatter the butter pieces and vanilla on top of the flour mixture. Process with on-and-off pulses until the mixture begins to hold together. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and space them evenly on an ungreased 10x15-inch baking pan. Dipping your fingertips in flour, pat out the dough until it covers the pan evenly. Bake the crust in the bottom third of the oven for 15 minutes. Then take it out, but leave the oven on. Meanwhile, prepare the topping. TOPPING (last 9 ingredients) Place the butter, honey, sugars and salt in a heavy saucepan. Stirring constantly, heat over a medium-low heat until the butter melts and the mixture is well combined. Raise the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil, without stirring, for 1 minute. Take the saucepan off the heat and stir in the cream, all the almonds and orange rind. Pour this mixture over the bottom crust and stick the pan back in the oven, still in the bottom third of the oven. Bake the triangles (of course, they're not triangles yet!) for 20 minutes at 350 F. Then turn up the heat to 375 F., transter the pan to the middle of the oven, and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes. The topping should be amber-colored and bubbling all over before you take it out. Cool the pan on a wire rack. When the topping is completely cool, use a sharp knife to cut it into 20 squares. Lift the squares out of the pan and place them on a cutting board before you cut them into 2 triangles each. Getting triangular bars out of a pan can be an ugly scene. Store in a tightly covered container. Makes 40 triangles. Posted to EAT-L Digest by pat hogberg &lt;p_hogberg@HOTMAIL.COM&gt; on Dec 30, 1997</li>

Cook, uncovered and without stirring, to 300F on candy thermometer, or until a few drops of syrup in cold water form hard, brittle threads. 4. Remove from heat; add butter and ground almonds. 5. Pour into prepared cookie sheet. Using the 2 lemon halves and working quickly, smooth out and push from the center to the edge of the cookie sheet until the brittle is 1/8" thick. 6. Lift brittle off the sheet before it is completely cooled and hardened, and mold it against the inside of prepared mold. 7. Cool completely - about 2 hours. Unmold just before it is to be served. 8. To unmold: With spatula, carefully loosen candy from pan; remove. Makes 1 large bell. Note: Leftover pieces can be kept in a closed jar at room temperature, or wrapped in aluminum foil.

Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula-, be careful not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward end of mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients-, gently fold egg whites into batter. 4. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You can can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5 minutes.)

By making your own baking powder using baking soda and cream of tartar and by cutting back on the quantity of milk, you can make a thick,quite respectable batter. The result is a waffle with a crisp crust and moist interior. Recipe by: Cook's Illustrated, Nov./Dec. 1993, Page 28.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Pork loin chops; 1 inch thick (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds total)</li>
      <li>1 Lime; Juice of (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups Coarsely crumbled cracker crumbs</li>
      <li>6 ounces Fresh mushrooms; finely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>3 Scallions; chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dried parsley flakes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Brush both sides of the pork chops with the lime juice and place them in a 9" x 13" baking dish that has been coated with nonstick vegetable spray. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Mix until well blended then spoon evenly over the top of the chops. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cooked through. NOTE: These can be prepared, covered, and refrigerated overnight before baking. That way, you can put a fancy dinner on the table without having to do any last-minute preparation. (I like that!) Oh, and for a little extra oomph, I sometimes add 1/2 teaspoon dried ground coriander.

    <recipetext>
      <li>F.&amp;R.Dahl: "This delicate soup, popular 100 years ago, is now unusual. On no account should it be liquidized at any stage, as that ruins the texture" Mince the almonds and, using a pestle and mortar, reduce to a paste with the egg yolks and a little stock, to stop them oiling. Bring the stock up to simmering point in a saucepan and whisk in the beurre manie. When that has dissolved, whisk in the almond paste. Cook gently for 30 minutes. Strain through a sieve, add the cream, season with salt and pepper, heat gently and serve.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 ounces (1/2 cup) ground almonds</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) ground rice</li>
      <li>1/2 pints (1 1/4 cup) milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Gelatin</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here are a couple of recipes for almond pudding. There are lots of variations of this dish some using dairy products, some using gelatin and some using agar agar and some combining them. It IS good! This first one is more "from scratch". The second uses almond extract. Mix the almonds and rice in a bowl with 2 pints (5 cups) cold water, cover and leave for 2 hours. Strain through a fine muslin into a large bowl. Add milk and mix well. Stand the bowl in a large saucepan with enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the bowl. Cover and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add the sugar, stir well and leave to cool slightly. Mix the gelatin with 2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) hot water until dissolved. Stir into the milk mixture when almost cold. Mix well and pour into a shallow serving dish. Leave until set.

    <title>Almond "Tile" Wafers (Tuiles Aux Amandes)</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>5 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cups (about 2 large) egg whites</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Plus</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Almond extract</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Plus</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons All-purpose or unbleached white flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sliced unblanched almonds (up to 2/3)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F. Very generously grease several baking sheets. Set out several rolling pins, wine bottles, or other similar-sized cylinders for shaping wafers and lightly grease them. Warm butter in a small saucepan over lowest heat. Remove from the heat and set aside to melt and cool slightly. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the egg whites and salt with a wire whisk until frothy. Gradually sift in powdered sugar, whisking until blended and smooth. Whisk in almond extract. Gradually sift flour into mixture, whisking until very smooth and slightly thickened. Whisk in the cooled butter. Drop 4 to 5 very small rounded teaspoonfuls of batter onto a baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 1/4 inches apart. (Keep the portions very small and don't crowd them as they spread a great deal.) Using the tip of a table knife, and swirling in a circular motion, spread each spoonful of batter into a 1 3/4-inch round. Very generously sprinkle sliced almonds all over each round. Place on the top rack of the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the wafers are rimmed with 1/2 inch of brown. Reverse baking sheet from front to back halfway through baking to ensure even browning. Remove baking sheet from the oven and let stand for about 20 seconds. Begin gently testing the edges of wafers with a spatula and as soon as they are firm enough to lift without tearing, quickly loosen each from the sheet using a thin-edged, wide-bladed spatula. Immediately drape wafers over rolling pins or cylinders. (If the last wafers on baking sheet cool too much while others are being removed, return baking sheet to oven for 1 or 2 minutes to rewarm. They may still be difficult to remove, however.) As soon as tuiles are stiff, transfer from rolling pins to wire racks to cool thoroughly. Cool, clean, and thoroughly regrease baking sheets before reusing. Repeat with remaining batter. Store tuiles in an airtight container for up to a week. Freeze for longer storage. Handle wafers gently as they are extremely fragile. Makes about 30 3- to 3 1/2-inch wafers. Recipe and comments are from _The International Cookie Cookbook_ by Nancy Baggett.

      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Molasses</li>
      <li>Sugar for rolling</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Into a medium bowl, sift together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. In a large bowl with electric mixer, beat Prune Butter and sugar until well-blended. Beat in egg and molasses until well-blended. Stir in flour mixture until completely mixed. Place a little sugar in a medium bowl. Scoop out heaping teaspoonfuls of mixture. Using your palms, roll into 3/4-inch balls and drop into the sugar. Roll to cover the surface completely; then place balls 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake until cookies are slightly rounded and tops appear lightly browned and crackles. Remove baking sheets to wire racks to cool slightly. The, using a metal pancake turner or palette knife, remove cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Repeat with remaining cookie dough and sugar. Store in airtight containers. * Prune butter is from "Secrets of Fat Free Baking" by Sandra Woodruff. To make one cup, combine 8 oz prunes and 6 tb water or fruit juice in food processor. (I used apple juice for the batch for this recipe.) Source: Lisa Clarke, based on Cookie Jar Gingersnaps in "The Complete Cookie Book" by Elizabeth Wolf Cohen Notes: The cookies have 39.5 calores (3.6% from fat) and 0.2g fat each. They also have more dietary fiber, potassiumn and calcium than the originals, and less cholesterol. They were delicious, but rolling them into balls was a nightmare. They stuck to everything. They may need more flour. They also didn't flaten out as much as the originals. They kept their ball shape, for the most part. The Chef's Comments: "Yesterday i took a cookie recipe that I wanted to try, and I made exactly according to the recipe (it was great!) and then I made another batch, using the Prune Butter technique. For cookies, the book suggests replacing all of the fat with Prune Butter, and removing as much sugar as 1/2 to 2/3 the amount of Prune Butter used, to keep sweetness consistent witht he original recipe. The low-fat recipe was a difficult texture to work with, and they didn't spread out nicely when cooking. They remained little clumps. But they did taste very good. I have a hard time telling the difference between the two, believe it or not. Who would have thought substituting prunes for crisco was a wise choice??" - Lisa From: Lisa Date: 09-08-96 (12:38) The Polka Dot Cottage, a BBS with a taste of home. 1-973-822-3627 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #713 by Lisa Clarke &lt;lisa@gaf.com&gt; on Aug 1, 97</li>

      <li>1/4 cups All purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped sliced almonds</li>
      <li>Fortunes*</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and butter a large round area (about 6 inches) in middle of a baking sheet. In a small bowl whisk egg white just until foamy. Add flour, sugar, almonds, and a pinch salt and beat until smooth. Put 2 teaspoons batter on buttered area of baking sheet and with back of measuring spoon spread batter evenly into a round about 3 inches in diameter. Bake cookie in middle of oven until golden around edge but pale in center, about 5 minutes. Working quickly, with a spatula remove cookie from baking sheet and invert onto a work surface. Put a fortune in middle of cookie and fold cookie in half. Bend pointed edges of cookie toward each other and hook them onto rim of a liquid measuring cup or deep heavy bowl to cool completely. Make more cookies with remaining batter in same manner, letting baking sheet cool between cookies. Cookies may be made 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container. Yield: 8 cookies *Note: To make the fortunes, cut 3 by 1/2-inch strips of paper and write or type your own fortunes with non-toxic ink. Because you must work quickly to shape the cookies, it's best to make them one at a time. Using more than one baking sheet is also helpful because you won't have to waste time waiting for the baking sheet to cool. A liquid measuring cup or deep heavy bowl is a good tool for shaping the cookies.

Add rose water and egg whites; process until well-blended (the mixture will be very thick). With floured hands, shape the dough into 28 balls, and place 2 inches apart on baking sheets coated with cooking spray. Bake at 325 degrees for 28 minutes or until crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; cool on racks. Yield: 28 cookies (serving size: 1 cookie). The original version of these cookies called for 2 cups of almonds. We replaced 1 cup with flour for a healthier, but still delicious, alternative.

    <recipetext>
      <li>overlapping, oil, almonds, lemon rind, garlic, pepper and oreganon or thyme. Brown lightly over medium heat for 5 minutes. Place the fillets in the pan and cook for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Add the lemon juice and salt, and simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how thick the fillets are. NOTE: I generally use frozen fillets, as they are much cheaper than fresh fish, and thaw them in the refrigerator before cooking. This recipe is also suitable for smaller fish, which can be cooked whole, extending the cooking times. I've often made this recipe with a fish called NILE PERCH, which is particularly nice (IMHO!)... but I wish there was someone, out there, who knows WHAT FISH is a Nile perch??

      <li>To prepare the pate royale, sift 2 cups flour onto a work surface &amp; make a well in the center. Place the salt, 1-1/2 tsp. sugar, 1/2 lb. butter, 2 egg yolks, &amp; cream in the well. Mix the liquid ingredients in the well with the fingertips, gradually incorporating the flour. Knead with the heel of the palm to obtain a smooth dough. Work the dough as little as possible. Chill the dough at least 30 minutes before rolling out. Meanwhile, prepare the almond cream by creaming 6 tablespoons butter &amp; beating in the almonds &amp; confectioners' sugar. When the cream mixture is well blended, whisk in the egg. Beat in the rum &amp; the cornstarch, whisking until the mixture is light &amp; smooth. Set aside. To make the pastry cream, scald the milk with the lemon peel &amp; vanilla extract. Whisk together the remaining 2 yolks, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, &amp; the remaining 2 tablespoons flour. Pour the scalded milk into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly, &amp; return mixture to saucepan. Boil vigorously for 3 minutes, stirring continuously to prevent scorching. Remove from heat, add remaining butter, &amp; leave to cool. Preheat oven to 425 F. Remove chilled pate royale from the refrigerator &amp; roll out to 1/8 inch thickness. Line a 9-inch flan ring or French tart pan with the pastry dough. Combine the almond cream with the cooled pastry cream &amp; spoon the mixture into the pie shell. Plunge the peaches into boiling water for 30 seconds; rinse under cold water. Remove the skins &amp; slice each peach into 8 wedges. Arrange the peach slices on top of the filling in a decorative pattern. Bake in oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until the almond filling is puffed &amp; browned.

Remove from oven and while still hot, you can mold the cookies into small cups by placing them over small cups, or shot glasses, or even the back of a muffin tin. Set aside to dry. When dry, the almond cookies can be eaten as is, or in my favorite way which is to fill them with mousse of some kind - or even ice cream or yogurt (if you eat hurriedly before they soften.) ;-) Source: Great Chefs of San Francisco, Avon Books, 1984 Chef: Masataka Kobayashi, Masa's, Vintage Court Hotel, : San Francisco, CA File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mm-gc-sf.zip</li>

    <title>Almond Float #1</title>
    <category>Dessert</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>3 cups Sweetened water</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Almond meats</li>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Agar-agar</li>
      <li>3 cups Water</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SWEETENED WATER</li>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Prepare the sweetened water (see recipe below). 2. Blanch almonds. Place half of them in a blender with water and blend to a smooth paste. 3. Strain mixture into a bowl through a double thickness of cheesecloth. Gather up corners of the cheesecloth and squeeze out every last drop of liquid; then discard residue. 4. Repeat this process with remaining almonds and the second quantity of water. 5. Break agar-agar in 1-inch sections and place in a saucepan with remaining water. Bring to a boil, stirring, and cook until agar-agar dissolves and begins to thicken. Then stir in almond liquid and cook 1 minute more. 6. Pour the mixture into a shallow rectangular pan. Let cool; then refrigerate until set. Cut in 1/2-inch cubes or diamond shapes. 7. Transfer to a deep serving dish. Serve with enough sweetened water poured over so almond cubes float. Garnish with slivered almonds, fresh strawberries or canned fruit such as mandarin orange sections, pineapple chunks, lichees or fruit cocktail. NOTE: This dish has many names--Almond Curd (because it's similar in consistency to bean curd), Almond Junket, and Almond Lake. It can be converted to a party punch by cutting the almond curd into finer pieces and using more of the sweetened water. VARIATIONS: 1. For the sweetened water, substitute the heavy syrup of any canned fruit. 2. In step 2, grind the almonds instead; then bring to a boil with 3 cups water and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Strain through the cheesecloth as in step 3. SWEETENED WATER: 1. Bring 2 cups water to a boil. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar and cook, stirring, until dissolved. 2. Let cool; then refrigerate to chill. (Allow about 1/4 cup sweetened water per serving.) VARIATIONS: 1. For the sugar, use either brown sugar; or about 1/4 pound rock candy. 2. In step 1, also add 1/2 cup light syrup from canned mandarin oranges. 3. After step 1, stir in 1 teaspoon almond extract. From &lt;The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook&gt;, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.

    <category>Cookie</category>
    <quantity>35</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>35 Almonds</li>
      <li>10 Almonds</li>
      <li>1 cup Lard</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Almond extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Blanch almonds. Leave the first quantity whole; grind the remainder to a fine powder. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 2. Cream together lard and sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat egg and add, along with ground almonds and almond extract. Blend in well. 3. Sift flour together with baking powder and salt. Gradually add to bowl, mixing with the hands to blend. Then knead into a dough. (If the dough is too stiff, add water a drop at a time to make it more pliable, but do not soften too much.) 4. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Then, with a cookie cutter, cut in 1-1/2 inch circles. (Or pinch off the dough and form into small balls which, when flattened, will make cookies of the same size.) 5. Grease a baking sheet with peanut oil; arrange cookies on top. With chopsticks or finger, make an indentation in the center of each cookie; then press in a whole almond. Bake until pale golden (about 15 minutes). NOTE: Almond cookies may be baked in advance, wrapped in foil and frozen. VARIATIONS: 1. For the lard, substitute either butter or 1/2 cup peanut oil. (One teaspoon sesame oil may be added to the latter.) 2. For the flour, substitute rice flour; for the white sugar, light brown sugar. 3. For the almond extract, use half-almond, half-vanilla extract. 4. In step 5, before topping with almonds, glaze the cookies by brushing them with a mixture of 1 egg yolk and 1 tablespoon water, beaten together. 5. In step 5, omit the almonds. Instead, dip the end of a chopstick into red food coloring and lightly touch the indented center of each cookie to decorate. From &lt;The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook&gt;, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.

Stir the mixture continuously for about 15 mins to form a sticky dough. Cool and chill. Knead the dough, form a roll and cut about 2 dozen pieces. Shape into cresents and brush with egg whites. Scatter the almond flakes over each cresent and gently press the flakes in so that they stick to the cookies. Place cresents on a greased baking tray and bake in a moderately heated oven (*sorry* this is what the book says! - maybe 350 deg F?) for about 20 minutes. Mix the sugar and water and simmer for a while. Brush the cookies with this glaze 5 minutes before the end of baking time. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cream the softened butter and add the sugar in a stream. Continue beating until the butter/sugar whitens. Beat in the zest and rum, then the egg whites, one at a time, beating smooth between each addition. Mix the almonds and flour together and stir them into the batter by hand. Pipe the batter on paper lined pans in 1-inch mounds using a 1/2-inch plain tube. Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes. For the glaze: Bring the preserves and the Kirsch to a boil in a small pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. Apply glaze while it is still very hot. Cool the cookies on the paper and sandwich them with raspberry glaze after they have cooled.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Boiling water</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Agar-agar, cut in pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup Evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Almond extract</li>

      <li>1 cup Mandarin oranges</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>A light, sweet, gelatinous pudding of very delicate texture, totally unlike a typical gelatin dessert - Jello it is not. Have large cooled bowl or (preferably) 9" x 9" glass dish ready for gelatin mixture. Add agar-agar to boiling water and stir until thoroughly dissolved. (Watch for burning on bottom.) At this stage, agar-agar will impart noticeable odor, but it does not carry through to finished dish. Add evaporated milk and sugar; bring back to boil and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add almond extract. Slowly add hot water, continuing to stir until sugar is completely dissolved. As soon as mixture returns to boil, turn off heat. Pour mixture into bowl for setting. When it has cooled slightly, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Turn jellied mixture out onto flat plate, then cut it in 1" squares. Place squares in individ- ual serving bowls with Mandarin orange wedges and their juice. Cover and return to refrigerator until ready to serve.

      <li>2 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Plain low-fat yogurt; beat until slightly</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE FILLING</li>
      <li>1 pound Fresh spinach</li>
      <li>Coarse salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Parsley; chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup Onion; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Allspice</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Sumac</li>
      <li>1 Lemon, Juice of (about 3 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Walnuts; finely chopped</li>
      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Oven: 350=B0 For the dough: In the workbowl of a food processor, combine the yeast, sugar and water, pulsing once. Spread 2 cups of the flour mixed with the salt and the baking soda over the yeast and place the workbowl cover on top. Let stand 15 minutes. With the machine running, slowly add the oil and then the yogurt. Process until smooth, about 20 seconds. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and springy in texture, about 5 minutes. Cover with a heavy kitchen towel and put in a warm place until dough rises, about 1 hour. For the filling: Wash and stem the spinach. In a large colander, rub the spinach with 1 1/2 tablespoons salt, let stand for at least 30 minutes. Squeeze the spinach to remove excess moisture; rinse to remove excess salt and chop finely. Squeeze the spinach until dry. Add the parsley, onion, allspice, sumac, lemon juice, olive oil, nuts and pepper to taste. Correct the seasoning. Preheat the oven to 350ø. Divide the dough into nine equal parts. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each part into a smooth round and allow to rest for 10 minutes, then roll each part into a 5-inch round. Place an equal amount of filling in the shape of a long triangle in the center of each round. Fold two sides in toward the center, and the remaining short side down to form a triangle. Crimp the seams with fingertips. Bake on a non-stick pan until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, set the pan on a rack, cover with a damp towel and let stand 10 minutes. Serve hot or cold.

Drain tomato liquid into measuring cup. Add water to make 1 3/4 cups. Cut up tomatoes. 4. To onion mixture, add liquid, tomatoes, tomato sauce, sugar and salt. Heat to boiling. 5. Remove from heat and stir in rice. Pour into greased 1 1/2-qt casserole. Cover and bake at 350F for 35 mins or until rice is tender and liquid absorbed. 6. Fluff rice with fork. Sprinkle with cheese and bake 5 more mins. Garnish with bacon. Per 1 of 6 servings: 269 calories My notes: I made so many changes (2/98) it's hardly the same recipe. I omitted bacon (good) and tomato sauce (okay but not great), added extra water to make up for the sauce, added garlic (minced, in with the onion), and italian seasonings for flavour.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here is one from the book, "Breads of New England", I'm not sure of the authors name, though. In a saucepan, combine milk, shortening, sugar and salt. Place over medium heat and stir until shortening is melted. Remove from heat and whisk in cinnamon and nutmeg. Transfer to a large mixing bowl to cool. When barely warm to the touch, stir in dissolved yeast and beaten eggs. Add 2 cups of flour and beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to create a moist, stiff dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently working in additional flour, if necessary. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Cover with a clean towel and let rest 30 minutes. Generously grease two baking sheets. Roll the dough to a 1/2 inch thickness and cut out with a 2 1/2 inch doughnut cutter. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets. (You will have about 36 doughnuts.) Brush with 1/4 cup of the melted butter. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise. When double in bulk, brush with remaining 1/4 cup butter. Place in a preheated 425° oven and bake 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on rack 5 minutes then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar while warm.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/2 pounds Spaghetti squash</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic; minced</li>
      <li>1 cup Chicken broth</li>
      <li>12 ounces Skinless boneless chicken breasts; cut in 1/2" cubes</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Milk or heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fresh parsley or basil leaves; packed</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. With a sharp knife, prick the squash in 2 to 3 places and set it on a baking pan. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove it from the oven, cut it in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Return the squash halves, cut side down, to the baking sheet and bake for another 30 minutes or until tender. While the squash is cooking, heat the butter in a medium sized saucepan. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring continuously. Add the garlic, broth and bring the mixture to a boil, whisking all the while. Add the chicken and simmer, uncovered, for 3 to 5 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Remove from the heat and stir in the milk or heavy cream. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper to taste; set aside and reheat over low heat when you remove the squash from the oven. Remove the squash from the oven. With a fork rake the squash until it separates fully into strands and only the shell remains. Transfer the strands to pasta bowls. Remove the chicken sauce from the heat, stir in the cheese and parsley or basil and adjust the seasoning. Serve the sauce over the strands of squash.

      <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>

      <li>[seperate recipe]</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Scrub the potatoes and bake them in a 400 F. oven for 1 hour or until done. While the potatoes are baking, prepare the filling. Saute the onions and carrots in the oil until they are tender, for about 10 minutes. Add the bell pepper and spices and continue to saute for another minute or two, stirring. Add a little water to the pan to prevent sticking, cover it, and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the bell pepper is just tender. Stir in the cream cheese and add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, make a lengthwise cut in the top of each one and scoop out at least half of the contents. If you are using large potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise and scoop them out, leaving about 1/2 inch of potato clining to the skin. Mash the scooped-out potato and then add it to the vegetable-cream cheese mixture. Lower the oven heat to 350 F. Fill the potato shells with this mixture and place them in an oiled baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Serve topped with Spicy Yogurt Sauce. Baked Stuffed Potatoes served with Dal and your favorite chutney make a complete meal. Note: this dish can be prepared ahead. After stuffing the potatoes, wrap them well and refrigerate for up to two days. When ready to serve, bake them in a 350 F. oven for about 45 minutes.

Place the eggplant halves on a large platter and sprinkle generously with slat. Let stand about 20 minutes to allow the salt to draw out the eggplant's bitter juices. Pat the eggplant dry with paper towels. Dice the pulp of the eggplant and put it in a bowl with the tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, parsley, garlic, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper flakes. Fill the eggplant's cavities with this mixture. Oil a baking dish lightly, and put the eggplant halves into the dish. Bake until they are lightly golden, soft to the touvh, and easily pierced with the tip of a thin knife, 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of the eggplants. Serve hot or at room temperature. NOTES: This is from Biba Caggiano's _Trattoria Cooking_ cookbook. It is easy to do and can be doubled and frozen for an additional meal later on. One of Biba's notes is that she will dice any leftover eggplant and toss it quickly in a skillet with extra virgin olive oil and freshly diced tomatoes and serve it over penne, shells, or rigatoni.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 3-1/2 c. flour with baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices; whisk to blend. Set aside. Combine the eggs and sugar in large bowl of food processor. Process until pale yellow and slightly thickened. Add 1/4 c. of melted butter and sour cream; blend well. Add dry ingredients; beat until a moist, stiff dough is formed. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently, working in additional flour to prevent sticking. Dough should be soft and smooth. Cover; let rest for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (400 if using convection). Generously grease 2 baking sheets (I use nonstick baking sheets without additional grease). Roll the dough to a 1/2" thickness and cut out with 2-1/2" doughnut cutter. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets, ensuring that you leave at least 1" between doughnuts. Brush with the remaining 1/4 c. melted butter. Bake 12-15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer to a cooling rack. When doughnuts are completely cooled, combine the confectioners' sugar, water, and maple syrup in a small bowl. Blend until smooth, then spread over the surface of each doughnut. Serve immediately.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Rinse and thoroughly dry the salmon, inside and out. In a 2 quart mixing bowl combine the stuffing mix, hot water, capers, and chopped parsley. Toss lightly with a fork until the mixture is moist and blended. Place the minced bacon in a heavy 12 inch skillet and saute over medium heat for 4-6 minutes or until bacon is tender. Add the onion and saute for 3-5 minutes more until bacon is crisp, stirring frequently. Add the bacon, onion, and pan drippings to the stuffing mixture in the mixing bowl. Toss lightly with a fork to combine. Brush the inside of the salmon with the melted butter and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity of the fish loosely with the stuffing mixture. Skewer or sew the opening shut. Line with heavy foil a shallow baking dish or a pan large enough to accommodate the fish. Place the fish on the baking pan and bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 25 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Remove from oven and keep warm. When ready to serve, the skin can be removed easily, leaving head and tail intact. Coat the fish with Cucumber Sauce, garnish with lemon slices and parsley and serve at once.

      <li>Marjoram goes well with fish, and here's a recipe that uses it both in and on the fish. Neither lake trout nor salmon need be scaled, but do scale the pike. A whole baked fish on a garnished platter always looks good to guests. Salt and pepper the fish inside and out, then stuff it and sew up or skewer the opening. Place in a buttered pan and lay lemon slices along its length. Stick a toothpick in each slice. Add the vegetables, marjoram, bay leaf, and white wine and bake, uncovered, for about 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven, basting first with the melted butter and then with the liquid in the pan. CELERY STUFFING Saute the chopped celery and onions in butter in a small skillet for 15 minutes, until tender but still with a little bite. Add the chopped celery tops and the bread crumbs. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and savory. Makes 1 cup. FENNEL SEED AND TARRAGON STUFFING Mix all ingredients together and stuff fish.

      <li>Mix all these ingredients together and roll up in fish fillets, securing them with toothpicks. Divide it among four or five good-sized pieces. Bake at 400 for 30 minutes. During last 10 minutes pour newburg sauce over fish. It's good with flounder, but any white fish will do. I've used large cod and catfish fillets and butterflied them. Just enough so you can roll it up over the stuffing.

Heat remaining oil; add parsley, garlic, anchovies and capers; and stir fry 5 minutes over lively heat. 5. Add this mixture to the spinach; add eggs and blend well. 6. Arrange mixture in an oiled oven-proof serving dish and bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees F.

      <li>From: Ruth Heiges &lt;heiges@post.tau.ac.il&gt; Date: Fri, 2 Aug 1996 20:03:33 +0300 (IDT) The following are from today's (August 2, 1996) edition of the Jerusalem POST. This food writer, Daniel Rogov, is known for printing a lot of non-kosher recipes (to the dismay of a lot of JP readers), so I will spare you the French recipe (which uses goat cheese!). In all cases, I've changed butter to margarine and converted the metric measures to English approximations. These can be good anytime, but I'm thinking ahead to Rosh Hashana. The writer notes: "Despite their drawbacks, even mass-produced chickens can be made tasty, and there is no better way to prepare a chicken than by stuffing it with ingredients that complement and highlight the natural flavor of the meat. Italians are particularly fond of stuffing their chickens with rice and celery; the French use celery and onions; Egyptians, Syrians and Jordanians rely heavily on the use of nuts ..." Clean the chicken well, discarding the excess fat. Sprinkle lightly inside and out with salt. Let stand for 1 hour and then rinse in running water. [I doubt whether this is necessary if one soaks it in salted water for koshering.] Pat dry with toweling. In a bowl, mix together the chopped beef, onion, garlic and lemon rind. Add the rice, nuts and parsley and 1/2 tsp each of the salt and pepper. Mix well by hand and then saute' in a skillet with 1/4 cup of the oil, sauteing until the onions are translucent. With this mixture, stuff the cavity of the chicken. Sew closed. Place the stuffed chicken inn a baking dish and sprinkle to taste with salt, pepper and sweet paprika. With a brush, coat the chicken lightly with some of the remaining oil. Place in an oven that has been preheated to 200 C/390 F and baste occasionally wit oil and the pan drippings. The chicken will be ready when it is nicely reddish brown. Serve hot. Daniel Rogov, Jerusalem POST Magazine, August 2, 1996. ------ JEWISH-FOOD digest 295 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

Place slab of spareribs on a cutting board and cut between bones about 1/2" so marinade soaks through well. Place all marinade ingredients in a large bowl and mix together until well-blended. Place ribs in a shallow pan and spread marinade on both sides, and set for at least two hours (overnight is best.) Pour enough water in the baking pan to 1" from bottom, but make sure it does not touch the rack. Place spareribs on rack, meaty side up, and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Turn spareribs with leftover marinade, add potatoes to the side of the pan, and bake for another 30 minutes. Turn spareribs once again and switch to broil for the last 4-5 minutes (keep an eye on the ribs) until spareribs have a nice glaze, almost burnt appearance. Remove, cool for 10-15 minutes to ease cutting up into individual ribs. Serve with potatoes on the side.

      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Do not peel the eggplant. Slice off the green cap and cut the eggplant in half lengthwise. Use a sharp knife to score the meat into 1/2-inch cubes, leaving 1/2-inch rim around the edge. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon and coarsely chop it. 2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the eggplant cubes and the onion to the skillet and saute over low heat, stirring frequently, until the eggplant is softened and lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the bread crubms, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and parsley. Season with the salt and black pepper. 3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F). 4. Sprinkle the eggplant shells lightly with salt and pepper and divide the stuffing between them. [The recipe may be made ahead up to this point and wrapped and refrigerated for up to 3 hours.] 5. To make the Potato-Tomato Sauce, coat the bottom of a 7-by-11 inch baking dish with the 2 Tablespoons olive oil. Pour the can of tomatoes into the baking dish and cut them into quarters with a sharp knife or the side of a spoon. Add the water to the pan. Peel the potato and cut it into thin (no more than 1/4-inch thick) slices. Stack the slices, cut them into 1/4-inch strips, and cut the strips into small cubes. Add them to the tomato mixture in the baking dish, along with the garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Set the stuffed eggplant shells on top of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the tops of the eggplant and into the sauce, and spoon a few pieces of tomato from the sauce onto the tops of the eggplant to help keep it moist. Drizzle a teaspoon or two of olive oil over the tops of the eggplant. 6. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the tops of the eggplant are lightly browned, about 1 to 1-1/4 hours. The sauce will reduce quite a bit as it cooks. Cut each stuffed eggplant in half, and serve one piece each with some sauce spooned over it. from Sunday Suppers, by Melanie Barnard &amp; Brooke Dojny 1988 ISBN 0-13-875832-8 Collection of recipes from "Great Sysops of the World" from COOKFDN ops.

Add chopped tomato, Tabasco sauce, parsley, thyme, salt, sage and bread which was soaked in cold water, then squeezed dry. Blend all in skillet, then stuff into fish cavity. Skewer opening closed. Bake, uncovered, in preheated oven set at 350 degrees, basting often with sauce. Allow about 10 minutes baking time per pound of fish. A greased sheet of paper or white cloth left under the snapper will make it easier to transfer to serving platter. Now back to the basting sauce: Blend butter, lemon juice, salt, Worstershire sauce and Tabasco sauce, adding oil a little at a time. Pour over fish before starting baking. Baste often.

      <li>1/4 cups Grated parmesan</li>
      <li>Paprika</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's my grandmother's recipe for stuffed potatoes, which are decadent, yet so satisfying! Preheat oven to 425ø. Wash potatoes and bake 45-60 minutes, until soft. When done, and slightly cooled, cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out potato and mix with all other ingresients, except cheese. Lower oven to 375ø. Fill each potato skin up with mixture. Sprinkle parmesan and then paprika on top of each shell. Return to oven and bake for 15 minutes, untilk cheese melts and potatoes are slightly bubbly. These can be made ahead of time: after filling skins, wrap individually in clear wrap, and refrigerate or freeze. Let come to room temperature before baking.

      <li>A crustless quiche of spinach, with Swiss and cottage cheeses. This is always a favorite, and is so versatile it can be used in a number of different settings - as a vegetable, for luncheon, as an entree, or even as a first course. When teamed up with a tomato salad and crusty peasant bread, it makes a light, yet filling repast. 1. Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. Butter a 1-1/2 quart casserole. 2. Combine the cottage cheese, eggs, butter and Swiss cheese in a large mixing bowl. 3. Add the spinach and flour and blend thoroughly. 4. Transfer the quiche mixture to the prepared casserole. (The pudding may be prepared 6 to 8 hours in advance up to this point and refrigerated. Return to room temperature before baking.) 5. Bake for 60 minutes until the custard sets. Let cool for 10 minutes before cutting into portions and serving 6 to 8 side-dish portions; 4 to 6 luncheon portions Recipe By : The Uncommon Gourmet by Ellen Helman File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

      <li>1 pound Squid</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 Onion; chopped</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Raw long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Chopped fresh mint leaves</li>

      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>4 Peeled tomatoes; drained</li>
      <li>1/3 cups White wine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and small sand bag and ink. Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them inside and out with cold water. Heads and tentacles should be rinsed thoroughly and cooked along with the sacs after you stuff the latter. Drain and set aside. Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy frying pan, then add the onion and cook, without browning, until transparent. Stir in the rice and saute a few minutes, until golden. Blend in the parsley, mint, 2 tablespoons wine, pine nuts, and raisins, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add enough water to half cover and cook for a few minutes, then stuff the squid sacs with the mixture using a very small spoon and allowing enough liquid in each for the rice to cook. Seal opening with skewers or toothpicks. Place the stuffed sacs with the heads and tentacles in a baking-serving dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside. Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, 1/3 cup wine, and a little salt and pepper in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour the sauce over the squid and dribble the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the top. Bake in a medium-slow oven (300 F) for 1 1/2 hours or until the squid and rice are tender and the sauce has thickened. Serve warm or cold. From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.

    <ingredient>

      <li>1/2 cups Toasted oat bran</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Maple syrup</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Grated fresh orange peel</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Pumpkin pie seasoning</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix together oat bran, dry milk, orange peel, and seasoning. Wisk in squash and syrup. Bake at 350 degrees in a large rectangular pan (I use glass) for about an hour. Serve hot or cold. Notes: 1. I buy oat bran in bulk. Toast it at 350 degrees on a cookie sheet with edges. Stir every 10 minutes until light brown. I add the orange peel at this point and store it in the refrigerator. Do not add the orange peel before toasting, it burns. Already grated orange peel is available but the fresh tastes better. 2. I have made this with many different kinds of squash and or sweet potatoes. They are all good. The frozen squash is just the easiest. 3. Original recipe calls for cinnamon, I like the taste with the pumpkin pie spice but I've used others. I did not like plain clove. from "Lean and Luscious and Meatless" by Hinman and Snyder.

      <li>The secret to tender baked beans is to leave the salt out until they are finished cooking. For some reason, salt toughens them. To pamper your tummy, rinse off the beans when they are finished soaking in several changes of cold water. This recipe is easy to prepare ahead and cooks in only two hours. 1. Place the beans in a bowl, cover with cold water and soak overnight. Drain and rinse beans very well under cold water. 2. Place the beans in a large, heavy pot. Add enough water to cover the beans by 2". Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes, or until beans are tender but not mushy. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Drain the beans. 3. Place the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof casserole. Add the onions and wilt over medium-low heat until transluscent. Remove from heat and stir in the beans. 4. Stir in the tomatoes and reserved juices along with all remaining ingredients except the salt and pepper. 5. Bake, covered, for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 30 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Per serving: 327 calories, 5 grams fat, no cholesterol.

      <li>Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. In a 2-quart saucepan fry the bacon over high heat until crisp. Stir in the onions, cover pan, and continue cooking until onions are dark brown, but not burned, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the seasoning mix and cook about 1 minute. Add the stock, chili sauce, honey, pecans, orange juice, lemon juice, orange and lemon rinds and pulp, garlic, and Tobasco, stirring well. Reduce heat to low; continue cooking about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove orange and lemon rinds. Continue cooking and stirring about 15 minutes more to let the flavors marry. Add the butter and stir until melted. Remove from heat. Let cool about 30 minutes, then pour into a food processor or blender and process until pecans and bacon are finely chopped, about 10 to 15 seconds. This sauce may be used to barbecue chicken, pork or ribs. Makes about 5 Cups.

    <title>Barbra's Best Chicken Soup! Pt 1</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 large Stewing chicken/hen</li>
      <li>1 package Chicken feet; (no such thing as too many)</li>
      <li>2 small Turnips (white with purple top); peeled, root cut off</li>
      <li>2 medium Parsnips; firm (slice in 1/2 if long), peeled, root cut off</li>
      <li>6 medium Onions with a lot of skin; cut root off</li>
      <li>2 bunches Fresh parsley</li>
      <li>2 bunches Fresh dill</li>
      <li>6 medium Carrots cut in half; peel &amp; cut ends</li>
      <li>6 Stalks celery</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Table salt</li>
      <li>Fresh ground pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 Cubes Knorr® bullion</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Take your chicken and clean it! Get those red glops out of the indentations inside the chicken! Throw away the liver and keep any other parts that came with the chicken. Now you are going to need kosher salt. Table salt is *not* a substitution. Put the clean chicken in a pot of ice cold water [I even add ice cubes]. Use a pot large enough so the water will completely cover the chicken with room left over for more water. Pour [freehand] kosher salt into the pot. I really use a lot!! I imagine it could be close to a cup, but precision does not matter here as we are not going to use this water and will rinse the chicken. Give the water a few good swirls [by spinning the chicken around] to dissolve the salt. If you were lucky enough to find chicken feet [the supermarkets here carry them off and on. When they have them I buy a few packages and keep them frozen - a kosher butcher usually has them as well] rinse them and add them to the pot. Also add any extras that came with the chicken (gizzard, etc). Let this sit at least an hour. I believe this process is called koshering the chicken [I just do it cuz it makes my soup taste yummy]. Now that you finished watching your soap opera... come back to the kitchen and take the chicken out of the pot. Rinse it well and place on a large piece of foil on the counter. *Now look at that water. Yuk!!! See all the blood it drew out of the chicken and parts? Take kosher salt and pour a blanket of salt all over each piece [front and back]. Let it sit a half hour at room temp or you can refrigerate it overnight in ziplocks. Rinse it well and place it into the pot you are going to use to make the soup. Continue to rinse everything well and add to the pot. Now we have our chicken and other parts sitting in an empty pot. Take about six medium to small onions [you want ones with a lot of skin] and cut off *just* the root. Throw them in the pot. Add two (2) Knorr® chicken bullion cubes. Fill the pot up with *cold* [very important] water. Again, I am not sure I remember [I can find out if you want to know], but I think if you add a chicken to hot/boiling water it will seal the juices/flavor into the chicken so while the chicken might taste okay... your soup tastes like water. Carefully [it should be pretty heavy] carry the pot to the stove. Now you can add table salt [I am not one to really cook with salt, but when it comes to chicken soup... I just freehand it!!!! I have the Calphallon professional size salt and pepper shakers so there must be 60+ holes at the top of the salt shaker and I turn it upside down and let it pour!]. I also add fresh ground pepper [according to your taste]. Let the soup come to a rapid boil and turn the heat down slightly. Skim the foam off the top and discard. Allow the soup to cook at a rapid boil for 1 hour. Add two small turnips [peeled and root cut off], and one large or 2 small/medium parsnips [peeled and root and tip cut off- if large cut in half]. Continue cooking for another hour. If the water level reduces then add more hot water from the tap. Time for the carrots and celery. If you are going for the clear broth: Peel about 6 carrots cut off tip and end and cut each in half. Throw [okay gently place] them into the soup. I guess you can use about six stalks of celery as well. Leaves and all. Wash it well, cut in half and add to soup [usually I never use the bottom piece of the celery for anything, but it is just great for the soup]. If you want to eat the carrots and celery: Still add the carrots the same way as they will be easy to pick out of the soup and can be neatly sliced when cool. As for the celery, you *must* slice the stalks into about 3/4" pieces [remember celery shrinks when cooking]. Lower the flame to medium and cook another hour. Come back. Now really clean the parsley under water *very* well. I know of nothing that is as dirty as parsley and dill. You can literally see all the dirt washing out. As for the dill: If you bought it with roots, cut just the dark [dirt] tip off and wash well. Add all to soup alternating between a handful of dill then a handful of parsley so it is all mixed up. Use a spoon and mix the soup and try to push a lot of the greens under the chicken. I continued in part 2</li>

Lay out all ingredients on a large work surface such as kitchen table. Heat a skillet on high. While you are assembling a quesadilla, have one browning at the same time. Remember to brown both sides. Assembly: Place ingredients in the order listed above on top of one tortilla. Cover with another tortilla and press down with open palm to flatten. Cutting: The easiest way to do this is with a clean pair of sharp scissors. All them to cool down enough to handle and cut into 4 triangles. These are great for parties and you can make them ahead and reheat in the oven. JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #004 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

    <quantity>32</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 pounds Pork Butt or Shoulder Roast; lean, boneless</li>
      <li>2 large Spanish onions; (sweet)</li>
      <li>1 large Bottle Kraft Honey BBQ Sauce OR KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup Ginger Ale (or Coke)</li>
      <li>4 packages Sandwich buns (8 per pkg.)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut onions in half lengthwise, slice in 1/4" slices, halve the slices and separate into rings. Trim all possible fat from roast and sprinkle with garlic salt and seasoned pepper. Place half the onions in crockpot, put in roast and top with rest of onions. Pour 1 cup of soda over all, cover and cook on LOW for 10 to 12 hours, or overnight until pork can be easily shredded with two forks. Remove pork from pot, shred in a bowl, removing all possible fat. Remove onions with slotted spoon and add to bowl. Discard juice in pot. Return onions and pork to pot, add BBQ sauce to all and mix. Continue to cook on LOW for 5 to 6 hours, adding more BBQ sauce as needed. Serve as sandwiches in buns. (I use Pepperidge Fram Sandwich rolls). Leftovers may be cooled, made into sandwiches, wrapped in heavy plastic wrap and frozen individually for later use. (I store them in the sandwich roll bags, 8 to a bag, sealed with the tab that came with the bag). They keep well and may be unwrapped, rewrapped in paper towels and heated in a microwave at 50% for a few minutes. NOTE: Idea from Laurie Robinson (SNMJ29D) 01/14/93: "I made up a batch of BBQ pork but did not have enough rolls to freeze it with. I put globs of it on cookie sheets and froze them for a day. Then I put the globs into zip lock baggies and popped them in the freezer. I have used a glob on a baked potato for lunch (terrific), and sent some to work with my hubby with fresh rolls for the microwave. These globs take very little space in the freezer and are very convenient for use." Wonderful idea! From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Combine all the ingredients thoroughly. Core the hot dogs diagonally on three sides. Barbecue basting with the sauce about three times while they are cooking. You can also use this on pork or chicken or the heated sauce in a chafing dish with sliced hot dogs. Makes about 1 1/2 cups of sauce, (enough for 2 lbs of hot dogs).

Marinate the portobellos in balsamic vinegar for an hour beforehand and then throw 'em on the grill like burgers. I remove the stem and cut slits on the cap.

Using food processor with metal blade: While processor is running, add garlic cloves one at a time, and keep running until garlic sticks to side of processor bowl, stop processor. 4. Add quartered onion, and process until pieces are about 1/4 inch in size, remove. 5. Add quartered green pepper, and chop to same size as onions. 6. Put all ingredients in saucepan, except seasonings, mix well. Bring to boil, and reduce heat. 7. Add seasonings, and simmer 30 minutes or more if desired. 8. Adjust salt 9. During the cooking time you may want to cook covered or uncovered, depending upon desired thickness of the sauce. 10. Adjust seasoning. Baste meat with sauce while BBQ'ing. This sauce is great for BBQ'd chicken, spareribs, pork chops, and sliced pork. Hint: When adding seasonings add salt first, stop when you can just barely taste the salt. Now add pepper to taste. Add remaining spices/herbs. Adjust spices to your taste. Serve additional sauce with the meat. Freeze leftover sauce, it will keep frozen for months.

Use immediately or store in a cool, dark place for several months. This rub is pretty strong and so I do not recomment it for thin cuts (like ribs). Bit it is swell on heavier cuts of meat such as beef round, prime rib, pork shoulders, and even the whole hog. With this recipes, you have enough for five shoulders or four hams. Best if you let the meat marinate, losely covered, in the refrigerator for a good twenth-four to forty-eight hours after being rubbed.

      <li>From: mariusj@best.com (Marius Johnston) Date: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 17:04:16 -0700 The short of it is is that BBQ has been with us since the dawn of man. BBQ as a conscious act, not just as the way to cook, is older than the 40's. The book I mentioned earlier, Housekeeping in Old Virginia (1879) specifically mentions Barbecue For example: Lay the rabbit in salt and water half an hour, scald with boiling water, wipe dry, grease with butter, and sprinkle with pepper and a little salt. Lay it on the gridiron, turning often so that it may cook through and through, without becoming hard and dry. When brown, lay on a hot dish, butter plentifully on both sides, and add a little salt and pepper. Set in the oven, while preparing four teaspoonfuls of vinegar, one of made mustard, and one of currant jelly or brown sugar. Pour this over the rabbit, rubbing it in, then pour over the gravy and serve hot. 7bq-digest V2 #050 From the BBQ recipe list.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I let the chicken stand in the fridge for a good hour before cooking on the Weber with a combination of charcoal and hickory (plain tap water in the drip pan.) I personally thought it was a tad bit on the salty side, but the family said it was fine. Must have been me. Next time I might back off some on the plain salt and the garlic powder and make up the difference with Lawry's (Coarse Ground with Parsley) Garlic Salt, which I happen to like a lot. NOTES : The weather finally warmed up around here (Eastern Nebraska) long enough to allow for barbequing some chicken this past Saturday. I let a split fryer sit in white vinegar for twenty minutes or so, turning a few times. Next I coated the halves with olive oil. Then I sprinkled on this rub (makes plenty for one split fryer): Recipe by: Craig Edmundson Posted to recipelu-digest by molony &lt;molony@scsn.net&gt; on Feb 04, 1998</li>

    <title>Asparagus and Mushrooms with Black Bean Sauce</title>
    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Asparagus, stiff ends</li>
      <li>Peeled</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Brown button mushrooms (or</li>
      <li>Mixed mushrooms)</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fermented black soybeans</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Tamari (or soy sauce)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Potato starch (or</li>
      <li>Cornstarch)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sake or other rice wine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut asparagus on the diagonal into 1-2 inch pieces. Blanch for 5 minutes in boiling water. Drain and set aside. Wash and slice mushrooms. Set aside. Mince the garlic. Rinse the black beans well. Mix garlic and beans together. Set aside. Mix together the rice vinegar, tamari, starch, sugar, and sake. Set aside. Fill a glass with water and set handy next to the stove. Put a skillet over high heat. When the pan is hot, dump the garlic mixture into the pan. Stir fry for one minute, adding water as the mixture begins to stick -- add just a little at time. Add the asparagus and stir fry for 10 minutes (or until asparagus is just shy of being crisp-done), again adding water just as needed. Add mushrooms and stir fry for 2-5 more minutes. Add the vinegar mixture (giving it a last stir to make sure starch is well mixed), stir until evenly coated and sauce thickens. Serve immediately. Comments: Fermented black soybeans are available in Asian markets. Usually labled "salted black beans". I find them in the preserved food section in plastic bags.

    <category>Chicken</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Chicken thighs</li>
      <li>12 medium Asparagus spears</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Peanut or corn oil</li>
      <li>MARINADE:</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Thin soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 pinch Sugar</li>
      <li>SAUCE:</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Fermented black beans</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Black soy sauce</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>Cornstarch paste as thickener</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Marinating: With sharp paring knife, scrape chicken meat from thigh; slice into thin strips across the grain. (Breast meat is not preferred for this dish, as meat is too dry and spongy.) Combine sherry, soy, cornstarch and sugar in bowl; massage liquid into meat with your fingers. Marinate for 15 to 30 minutes. Preparation: Wash asparagus; peel tough white outer skin off ends; slice on diagonal in 2 1/2" sections. Rinse fermented black beans. In bowl, combine and mash black beans and garlic, brown sugar, black soy sauce and chicken stock; stir; reserve for 15 minutes. Stir-Frying: Add 2/3 of oil to hot wok; when oil is very hot, add chicken. Stir-fry for about 3 minutes on high heat - or until chicken begins to shrink and firm up. Remove chicken to holding bowl. Reheat wok to high, add remaining oil. When oil is hot, add black bean sauce. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add asparagus; mix with sauce. Stir sauce with asparagus. When sauce boils, add cooked chicken; toss to combine. Dribble in a little cornstarch paste if needed; cornstarch in chicken marinade might be enough. Toss ingredients until very little liquid remains and is reduced to glaze. Dish is ready when asparagus brightens. If you still have too much liquid, remove ingredients, continue to reduce sauce, then return ingredients to coat them with sauce. Serve in individual portions.</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Medium sherry</li>

      <li>2 cups Warm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Button mushrooms, canned</li>
      <li>8 Fresh asparagus spears</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation: Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop into bite-size pieces. NOTE: if tempted to use breast meat without bones, please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup. Peel and slice ginger root. Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections. Braising: Heat wok to medium hot. Add sesame oil. Start braising chicken a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell. Sesame oil will burn at lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot wok. After browning lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger slices, sherry and salt. When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn up heat, bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and asparagus, simmer for another 15 minutes. Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl), place in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve. You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for something else.

Cook a minute or two stirring constantly. Make a little hollow on top of the onion; add bean sauce. Cook until onion starts to get translucent. Add asparagus and sprinkle over 1 teaspoon salt, sugar and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Cover and cook, taking the top off occasionally to stir well, just until asparagus is tender-crisp. Then, put the meat on top. Cook, stirring,just long enough to get the meat reheated. Seve at once. *TIPS: This is usually served over white rice. I always add more grlic, usually with the onion, and leaving it in. You can experiment with using flavored oil in part. Also, try a different Asian sauce if you have it on hand.

    <title>Asparagus En Fete</title>
    <category>Lifetime</category>
    <category>Tv</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Asparagus spears; peeled and trimmed</li>
      <li>1 cup Water; hot tap</li>
      <li>24 Black olives; oil curred</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Capers; drained</li>
      <li>1 cup Tomatoes; seeded and chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves; lightly packed</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: LEMON MUSTARD SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Fresh ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Virgin olive oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1.Place the asparagus in no more than two layers in the bottom of a sauce pan, preferably stainless steel. Add hot tape water, and bring it to a boil over high heat. Cover the pan, and continue to boil the asparagus over high heat for 4 to 5 minutes, until it is tender but still firm. Most of the water will have evaporated. 2.Remove the asparagus from the pan, and spread it out on a platter to speed cooling. When it is cool enough to handle, measure down 5 inches from the tip of each spear, and cut off and reserve the remainder of the stem ends. Then, starting at the bottom of the spears, split the stems in half lengthwise, stopping when you get to the tips and leaving the heads intact. Cut the reserved stem ends into 1-inch pieces. 3.For the sauce, combine the Dijon mustard, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and olive oil in a small bowl. 4.At a serving time, mix the 1-inch pieces of asparagus with the olives, capers, and tomato in a bowl. Arrange four asparagus spears on each plate so the tips extend to the edge of the plate and the stalks, spread open where they are cut, connect to create a "frame" around an open area in the center. Arrange some of the tomato-olive mixture in the center of each plate, and spoon some sauce over both the spears and the mixture. Sprinkle with the parsley leaves, and serve.

      <li>1/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>7 ounces Mild goat cheese</li>
      <li>Such as Montrachet</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Freshly grated lemon</li>
      <li>Zest, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 2/3 cups Freshly grated</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup Heavy cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the tips off each asparagus spear and reserve them. In each of 2 large shallow baking pans toss half the asparagus stalks with half the oil, coating them well, and roast them in a preheated 500 F oven, shaking the pans every few minutes, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender. Sprinkle the asparagus with salt to taste and let it cool. Cut the roasted asparagus into 1/2 inch lengths and reserve it. In a large bowl of cold water let the sheets of lasagna soak for 15 minutes, or until they are softened. In a saucepan melt the butter, add the flour, and cook the roux over moderately low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the broth and the water in a stream, whisking, simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, and whisk in the goat cheese, the zest, and salt to taste, whisking until the sauce is smooth. Drain the pasta well, arrange 1 sheet of it in each of 2 buttered 8 inch baking dishes, and spread each sheet with one fourth of the sauce. Top the sauce in each dish with one fourth of the reserved roasted asparagus and sprinkle the asparagus with 1/3 cup of the Parmesan. Continue to layer the pasta, the sauce, the asparagus, and the Parmesan in the same manner, ending with a sheet of pasta. In a bowl beat the cream with a pinch of salt until it holds soft peaks. Arrange the reserved asparagus tips decoratively on the pasta, spoon the cream over the pasta and the asparagus tips, spreading it with the back of the spoon, and sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan on top. Bake the lasagna in the middle of a pre- heated 400 F oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until it is golden and bubbling, and let it stand for 10 minutes before serving. Serves 8.

      <li>Heat your oven real hot - 500 to 550F is good. Place asparagus in a single layer in a shallow baking disk, drizzle with a bit of olive oil, sprinkle with a bit of coarse salt and roast, shaking the disk occasionally until the tips are starting to get a bit crunchy. Serve as is or drizzled with a little EV olive oil and balsamic or sherry vinegar. or 1) Cook al dente in water, cut into pieces similar in length to the pasta in step 3. 2) Heat a couple cups of milk, add a few tablespoons of butter and crumble in some imported gorgonzola and parmesan cheese, stirring all the time until thick and creamy/saucy. I probably use about 2-3 ounce of gorgonzola and a big handful of parmesan, but I just keep adding until it tastes right to me. Keep warm 3) Cook some penne, fusilli or other pasta shaped sort of like asparagus al dente 4) Toss 1, 2 and 3 together. You can pass the cheese sauce through a strainer if you want to remove some of the blue veiny stuff from the sauce.
