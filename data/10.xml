    <title>Basic Bread and Rolls</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>24</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 cups Milk</li>
      <li>1 Fresh Cake Yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Shortening</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lukewarm Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, &amp; salt. Let it cool to lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water. When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together. The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon, stir until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2 hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting the dough rise at this point you may put it in the refrigerator and use it later, or the next day. Watch to make sure it doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it starts to spill before you're ready to use it, punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to handle but takes longer to rise. BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from sticking, knead it until springy and easy to handle. This dough does not require a lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle. For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again. Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain whether or not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned too). ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter and fold over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls). SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round. Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with butter and roll as for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan or make into a circle and make slashes through the dough at intervals. Let rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made of confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate with nuts or fruits. If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white. The amounts above will yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large rolls. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Someone asked for fatfree biscuits, here are some recipes from a favorite cookbook of mine, _Fatfree and Delicious_ by Robert Siegel. Please note that fatfree biscuits are not the same texture as the fatty ones, the fat gives the flakiness and tenderness. Place dry ingredients in bowl. Add milk to center of ingredients. Carefully fold from center to the outside until all ingredients are combined. Do not over stir! Drop by tablespoons onto a nonstick, lightly oiled cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, until golden. Posted to fatfree digest by "Jan Gordon" &lt;jan@gordon.com&gt; on May 20, 1998</li>

      <li>Basics for new cooks: In large pot, cover and bring water and salt to full rolling boil. Stir in pasta, separating pieces; return to boil and boil, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes or until tender but firm. Drain well. Tip: Fine strands and small shapes of dried pasta cook in as little as 3 minutes. Tip: If pasta is to be coated with a sauce, do not rinse. The starchy coating on pasta aids in holding sauce to the pasta.

Grease and flour a round baking pan, about 8 inches in diameter. Prepare the syrup by placing all the ingredients in a small pan and bringing slowly to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes or until the syrup forms a sticky film on the back of a spoon. Set aside to cool. Chop the almonds finely. Pour the yogourt into a bowl, add half the melted butter, sugar, semolina, baking powder, vanilla and almonds. Mix thoroughly until well blended. Pour the batter into the cake pan and smooth over the surface with the back of a spoon. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the surface of the cake is golden. Remove from the oven and pour the cold syrup evenly over it. Cut into lozenge shapes and return to the oven for 3-4 more minutes. Warm the remaining butter. Remove the basbousa from the oven and pour the butter evenly over the surface. Leave to cool.

      <li>1 quart Water</li>

      <li>Fill a large container with 1/2 quart of warm water. Add salt and sugar. Mix thoroughly until well dissolved. Add the remaining 1/2 quart of water. Immerse prepared fish chunks, filets or small whole fish completely in brine solution. Refrigerate fish in brine solution. Brine chunks of fish of fish 1" thick for about 5 up to 8 hours, 1/2" thick for about 4 hours, and for thinner filets or pieces 2-3 hours. After brining, always rinse your fish with plenty of fresh water. Pat the fish dry, and allow them to air dry for about 1 hour. This will cause a "pellicle" (a tacky glaze on the fish) to form indicating that it is ready for the drying and smoking process. courtesy of: starfishcons@starfishcons.com Posted to bbq-digest by Jeff Lipsitt Cable on Apr 23, 1998</li>

    <title>Basic Braised Beef</title>
    <category>Meat</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Beef chuck</li>
      <li>1 Scallion stalk</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic</li>
      <li>2 Or</li>
      <li>3 slices Fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sherry</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 dash Pepper</li>
      <li>2 Or</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Oil</li>
      <li>3 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Leave beef whole. Cut scallion stalk in 2-inch sections. Mince garlic and ginger root and combine with soy sauce, sherry, sugar, salt and pepper. 2. Heat oil in a heavy pan. Brown beef quickly on all sides. Add soy-sherry mixture and cook stirring to heat and blend (about 3 minutes). Meanwhile, boil water. 3. Add water to beef and bring to a boil again. Simmer, covered, until beef is tender (about 1-1/2 to 2 hours). NOTE: You may increase the soy sauce to 1/2 cup, the sherry to 1/4 cup; then reserve the gravy as a master sauce. (See recipe for "Master Sauce".) VARIATIONS: Cut the beef in large chunks. Cook only 1 hour in step 3. Cut the beef in 1-1/2 inch cubes. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt; then toss in 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce and 1/2 tablespoon sherry. Let stand 20 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally. Then brown as in step 2, but omit the soy-sherry mix. Cook about 45 minutes in step 3. Instead of browning the beef, plunge in a pan of boiling water, parboil 2 to 3 minutes, then drain. In step 1, do not combine the soy sauce and other seasonings. Instead, after browning the beef in step 2, cook it in the soy over medium heat, until well colored (about 10 minutes). Then add the scallion, garlic and ginger root; stir in the sherry, sugar, salt, pepper and 2 cups heated stock. Cook as in step 3, but omit the boiling water. In step 2, add any of the following: 2 cloves star anise 3 to 4 anise peppercorns and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1-inch piece of cinnamon stick 1 piece tangerine peel (soaked) 1 tablespoon wine vinegar During the last 30 minutes of cooking, add any of the following: 1 pound cabbage, cut in wedges 1 pound carrots, peeled and cubed 6 celery stalks, cut in 1-inch sections 1/2 pound chestnuts, parboiled 6 eggs, hardboiled and shelled 1/2 cup lily buds (soaked), cut in two 1 pound lotus root, peeled and cubed 1 cup dried black mushrooms (soaked), left whole 1 pound new potatoes, peeled and cubed 1 pound string beans, stemmed 1 pound Chinese white turnips, peeled and cubed During the last 15 minutes of cooking, add 2 cups bamboo shoots, diced. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, add 2 cups shelled peas or 4 tomatoes, cut in wedges. NOTE: When adding vegetables, do not also add star anise, anise pepper, cinnamon stick, tangerine peel or wine vinegar. (These will overwhelm the vegetable flavors.) They are better when the beef is cooked alone. From &lt;The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook&gt;, ISBN 0-517-65870-4. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <quantity>50</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2/3 cups Clover honey</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Sugar, granulated</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kirsch (cherry brandy) or orange juice</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>Finely grated peel (yellow part only) of one</li>
      <li>Large lemon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped candied lemon peel</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped candied orange peel</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Finely chopped blanched slivered almonds</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups All-purpose or unbleached white flour (or more)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oven to 350F. Generously grease two 10-by-14-inch or larger baking shets. Stir together the honey, sugar, and kirsch in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar completely dissolves and the mixture is hot but not boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the spices, lemon peel, candied peels, and almonds until completely incorporated. Stirring vigorously, gradually ad 2 1/4 cups of flour to the pan; the mixture will become very stiff. If the mixture feels sticky and too soft to roll out, stir or knead in a bit more flour, but be careful not to overflour. Set the mixture aside until cooled to barely warm. Sprinkle a work surface generously with flour. Divide the dough in half. Roll out half of dough into an 8 1/2-by-13-inch rectangle, frequently running a spatula under the dough and dusting the work surface. As needed, also dust the top of the dough and the rolling pin with flour. Transfer the dough to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Prick the dough lightly all over with the tines of a fork. Stagger the baking sheets on racks in the center third of the oven; switch positions halfway through the baking to ensure even browning. Bake for 13 to 16 minutes or until the dough top is just tinged with brown and slightly darker on the edges; avoid overbaking, as cookies will become crunchy and hard. Carefully run a spatula under the dough rectangles to loosen them from the pans. When just cool enough to handle, transfer the rectangles to a cutting board and cut away any uneven, dry edges using a large serrated knife. Deeply score the rectangles, but do not cut completely through the surface, lengthwise and crosswise, to yield 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. Return the scored rectangles to the baking sheets. In a small saucepan stir together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of water until thoroughly blended. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Boil, stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds, until smooth, very fluid, and translucent. Divide the mixture between the rectangles, pour over the top and quickly spread the glaze over the entire surface. Let stand until the glaze sets and turns white again, about 1 hour. Bend the rectangles to break apart or cut through the score marks to separate into bars. Let stand until the glaze is dry and hard. Pack airtight. Store for up to 3 weeks or more. Makes 50 to 60 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. [THE BALTIMORE SUN; November 25, 1990] Posted by Fred Peters.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Onions; large</li>

      <li>3/4 cups Yogurt, plain</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dates; stored &amp; finely chopped</li>

      <li>1 bunch Parsley, fresh; chopped salt and pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>" This is a vegetarian version of a Bedouin dish. If you serve it with rice, try adding saffron or tumeric to the rice before cooking. It adds a distinctive flavor as well as color, creating 'red' rice." Peel the onions and place them in a large pan of boiling water. Reduce the heat and let them simmer for 15-20 minutes, covered, until they are fairly tender. When they are ready, take them out and set aside to cool. Now remove the centre section of each onion, to leave a shell about 3/4 inch thick. In a bowl, mix together the lentils, pepper, salt, yogurt, dates, walnuts, raisins or sultanas and bread crumbs. Fill the onions with this mixture. Keep any that remains and mix it with the chopped discarded onion centres. Place the filled onions in an oven proof dish, spoon any remaining mixture around them and cook for about 20 minutes. Garnish with parsley ands serve with bulgur or 'red' rice (see note above).

Prepare syrup by putting the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil while constantly stirring to desolve the sugar. Let it boil until it appears clear. Add few drops of lemon and let it boil for a min. or so. Remove from saucepan and let it cool completly. Preheat the oven to 350xF. In a bowl combine all the remaining ingredients and stir until well mixed. If you are going to bke in a pan then oil it before you pour the batter. If you want to do bite size pieces then line the mini muffin pan w/ the paper cups and pour in them the batter. Decorate the surface w/whole blanched almonds or w/ pine nuts. Bake until golden. Remove from oven and pour some syrup on each and return the pan to the oven for a few min. to dry the surface.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Blanched whole almonds (about 7 ounces)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>3 1/2 tablespoons Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>3 ounces Bitterswet (not unsweetened) or swmisweet</li>
      <li>Chocolate, chopped fairly fine</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons (generous) almond extract</li>
      <li>2 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>2 To 5 Tbl confectioners' sugar for rolling out cookies</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 325F. Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil. In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar until the almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor and scrape down the sides several times. Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, and chocolate; continue processing until the chocolate is finely ground. Add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, the almond extract, and egg whites; process until the mixture is blended and just forms a mass. Set the dough aside for 5 to 10 minutes to stiffen slightly. Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar. If the dough seems too soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead until the consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar than absolutely necessary. Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, lifting it with a spatula frequently and redusting the surface and rolling pin with powdered sugar to prevent sticking. Cut out the cookies using a 2 1/4-inch heart-shaped (or similar) cutter. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart. Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and slightly puffy. Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until completely cooled. Peel from the foil. Store airtight for 3 to 4 days. Freeze, airtight, for longer storage. Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies. [THE BALTIMORE SUN; November 25. 1990] Posted by Fred Peters.

      <li>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 2. Toss the nuts in a large bowl to combine and spread them out on a cookie sheet. Toast in the oven until they become light golden brown, about 10 minutes. 3. In the large bowl, combine the rosemary, cayenne, brown sugar, salt, and melted butter. 4. Thoroughly toss the warm toasted nuts with the spiced butter and serve warm. Yields: 5 cups Source: The Union Square Cafe Cookbook, HarperCollins, 1994. Converted to MC format by Badams &amp; MC_Buster. Notes: These nuts won The New York Press award for "best bar nuts in New York." Every afternoon at about 4:45, a piping hot batch emerges from our ovens and is sent out to the bar, where the sweet rosemary fragrance wafts throughout the restaurant. Though we don't have a television set at our bar, these nuts would probably be a hit in your living room accompanied by a football game and some ice-cold beer.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Newsgroups: rec.food.recipes From: morrissey@stsci.edu (Mostly Harmless) Janet Morrissey From: pattee_d@cubldr.colorado.edu Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Toast the almonds until golden, then chop by hand into 1/4 inch chunks. *Reduce oven heat to *325* degrees* Cream the butter until light, add the sugar and beat till smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs until the mixture is smooth. Add the (orange, anise, lemon) specific ingredients. Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt, beat until just mixed. Stir in the almonds. On a floured board, divide the dough in half and roll each half into a long roll about 1-1/2 inches in diameter and about 10 inches long. Set the rolls on a baking sheet at least 3 inches apart, bake in the top third of the oven (*325*) for about 25 minutes, or until they are set and lightly browned on top. Cool the rolls for 5 minutes or so, then slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Lay the slices flat on the baking sheet and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Turn the slices over and bake for another 10 minutes. Cool on a rack, and keep in a tightly covered tin - they keep for months. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /COOKIES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <title>Basic Braised Soy Fish</title>
    <category>Fish</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 (2-lb) fish</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>3 slices Fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 Or</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Soy souce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sherry</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt (up to)</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Have fish cleaned and scaled, but left whole. Rinse in cold water. Dry well, inside and out, with paper toweling and score on both sides. 2. Sprinkle fish with the salt and let stand 10 minutes. Then coat lightly with flour. 3. Mince ginger root and scallions; then combine with water, soy sauce, sherry, sugar and remaining salt. 4. Heat oil in a heavy pan until nearly smoking. Gently lower in fish; fry over high heat 1 minute on each side, then over medium heat 2-1/2 minutes on each side. Baste continually with hot oil. (To turn fish over, loosen it with the back of a spatula and turn gently. The pan may be removed temporarily from the burner while the fish is being turned.) 5. Pour ginger-scallion mixture over fish and bring quickly to a boil. Then cook, covered, over medium heat until done (15 to 20 minutes), turning fish halfway through cooking. NOTE: Braised soy fish is good served hot or cold. It may be prepared in quantity and served cold as a side dish or with drinks. (Its sauce is delicious when jellied.) Braised fish may also be browned in advance, then cooked in sauce, as in step 5, just before serving. Once it's completely cooked, however, it should never be reheated. VARIATIONS: 1. For the water, substitute stock. 2. For the white sugar, substitute brown sugar. 3. In step 2, omit the salt and rub fish lightly with soy sauce before coating with flour. 4. In step 3, add to the sauce mixture any or all of the following: 2 tablespoons smoked ham, minced; 1 celery stalk, minced; few drops of sesame oil or vinegar. 5. During the last few minutes of cooking, add 1-1/2 cups fresh tomatoes, peeled and diced; or 2 cups bean curd, sliced or cubed. Cook only to heat through.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>(see "The Basics: Rice" for amounts)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Wash rice thoroughly, then spread evenly along the bottom of a saucepan. 2. Add the desired quantity of cold water for each cup of rice. (Let rice and water sit covered in pan for 30 minutes before cooking. This softens the rice, but can be omitted.) 3. Bring rice to a boil over 3/4 flame. Boil covered 3 minutes. Reduce flame to 1/2. Boil 2 minutes more, or until most of the liquid is absorbed. (At this point, before the water is completely absorbed, some cooks stir the rice gently from the bottom up so that it will cook more evenly and have less tendency to burn on the bottom. If some rice sticks to the sides of the pot during this stirring, just scrape it down.) 4. Lower flame to a minimum. Let rice cook covered 18 to 20 minutes more. Do not lift lid or stir rice during this time. (If you lift lid, valuable steam will escape; if you stir the rice, it will stick to the bottom of the pan. When cooking is done, some cooks lift the lid and stir the rice once, loosening it gently with a lifting motion of chopsticks, then replace the lid and let the rice stand for 10 minutes.) 5. Turn off heat. Let rice sit covered in pan 10 to 15 minutes. Then, with fork or chopsticks, fluff rice to separate each grain. The rice will then be soft, flaky and ready to serve. NOTE: Cooking time for rice varies from stove to stove and from pan to pan. Only actual experience can determine the precise cooking time.

      <li>1/4 cups Italian parsley leaves</li>
      <li>3 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Pine nuts</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Reggiano parmesan cheese; grated</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Olive oil; (to 1/2 cup)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In food processor, combine basil, parsley, garlic and pine nuts. Pulse until finely minced. Add cheese and process to blend. With machine running, drizzle oil through feed tube until desired consistency is reached. 2. Transfer to small bowl and cover with plastic wrap (press directly to surface to prevent discolouring). Alternatively, cover surface with thin film of oil or place pesto right into plastic bag. Store in fridge for up to 1 week. Tip: If you only have curly parsley, use 1/2 cup Per tbsp: 63 calories, 6g fat To freeze pesto. Prepare as above, omitting cheese and using smaller amount of oil. Place in freezer container, covering surface with film of oil or in freezer bags. Ice cube trays may also be used - once frozen, transfer to freezer bag. Will keep in freezer up to 6 months. Thaw in fridge, not in microwave. Stir in cheese after thawing. (Tip - to perk up colour after thawing, stir in 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley) Variations. Instead of pine nuts, use other kind of nuts. Toast first to enhance flavour. For lower-fat version, reduce oil to 1/4 cup and add 2 tsp lemon juice and 1/2 cup chicken stock. Or, replace some of the oil with sun-dried tomatoes. Use immediately. Use half Parmesan and half romano cheese Use roasted instead of fresh garlic.

      <li>11 ounces Water (110 - 120 deg.F)</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Gluten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>put yeast and malt into machine with several oz. of water. Use a thermometer for the water. Too hot will kill the yeast. The yeast will now proof (start to multiply) In a separate bowl, measure out all dry ingredients and mix. After a few minutes, yeast should be bubbling, add dry stuff and any liquids including the water. start the machine and see how it looks. If too dry, add until it looks right. Should be one big mass not several. Flour: I often substitute 1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of gluten for a cup of WW flour. For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar (I commonly use honey, molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins. 3 T of carroway seeds or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great. I have also added 2 mashed bananas, then cut the water. Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #411 by serge.cyr@sympatico.ca (Serge Cyr) on Nov 23, 1997</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Pre-cooked masa flour; (yellow or white)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>3 cups Water; boiling</li>
      <li>Butter; softened</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and Venezuela. They were an important part of their diet, like corn tortillas were to the Aztecs. Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela continued to use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of nourishment. Today, these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for the rich and poor alike, a heart-warming tribute to simplicity, tradition, versatility, and good taste. Originally, arepas were made from dried corn kernels that were soaked overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained and ground into masa (dough). Thanks to modern technology, a pre-cooked harina de masa is now available at most Latin American markets. An instant masa can be made by simply mixing this corn flour (either white or yellow) with a little salt and enough boiling water to make a stiff dough. The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses, depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or deep-fried. In parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab that is first heated and then brushed with fat. Another Colombian specialty -- arepas de chocolo -- are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of banana leaves. Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan counterparts. The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a flat bread roll, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside. They can be split open and buttered, or spread with cream cheese or fresh goat cheese. Made this way, they are served for breakfast or as an accompaniment for grilled fowl, fish, meat stews, or sausages. In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the shell is filled with savory mixtures of ground or chopped pork, beef, ham, chicken, seafood, vegetables, or beans. They are excellent first courses. Venezuelan mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped into rings and deep-fried. Another specialty is bollos pelones -- balls of arepa dough stuffed with seasoned ground meat, either fried or poached in water, then served with tomato sauce. A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh cheese and fried chorizo (sausage). Colombians also make tasty soups using fresh masa or leftover arepas. Arepitas dulces make great desserts. The versatile arepa indeed proves that unpretentioius food can be not only satisfying but also delicious. Directions: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add water, stir with a wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Let stand for 5 minutes, then knead for 3 minutes. Dough is ready to be shaped into standard arepas, or to be mixed and kneaded with other ingredients such as cheese, chicharrones (pork rind), etc. To shape arepas: The standard Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4 inch thick. Columbian arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 inch thick. To make arepas, oil or wet hands lightly and shape dough into balls. Place between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap and flatten into a circle; shape the edges to form a smooth disc. To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat; grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of times until a crust is formed. Colombian arepas are ready to be served at this point, spread with butter. Venezuelan arepas have to be baked in a preheate 350-degree oven for 15 minutes. To check for doneness, tap the arepa lightly -- if a hollow sound is heard, it's ready. Split open, add butter and serve hot. Arepas freeze well if frozen while still warm. Freeze in layers separated by plastic wrap. Reheat frozen arepas wrapped in aluminum foil in a preheated 350-degree oven for 10 minutes or until heared through.

      <li>4 ounces Blanched almonds</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and toast them in oven until lightly golden. Let cool. Coarsely chop half the nuts. Butter 2 large baking sheets. Mix flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Beat in eggs, then whole and chopped nuts. Mix to obtain a firm dough. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 pieces. On a floured work surface, roll each piece under your hands into a cylinder 15 inches long and about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place 2 rolls, well separated, on each baking sheet and bake 15 to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned and firm to the touch. With a spatula, carefully transfer the rolls to a cutting board and slice each one diagonally into cookies about 1/2-inch thick. Set wire racks on the baking sheets and lay out the biscotti on them. Return them to the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until very firm and crisp. Cool on the racks, then transfer them to a tin for long keeping. Try adding 1 1/2-to-2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to this recipe for a nice variation.

      <li>Ingredient Group: INFO ONLY</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Baking is a joy, not a chore, and should never be undertaken if you are feeling rushed. Use your imagination and alter the add-ins as you see fit. 1. Always read through the entire recipe before starting to Bake. 2. Start with ingredients at room temperature. 3. Always Bake bars, squares and cookies in the centre of the oven on the middle rack. If baking more than one pan at a time, place them at different angles on different racks to allow maximum circulation of heat. Alternate their placement on the racks halfway through the baking time. 4. The best pans are aluminum or metal pans that are light in colour. Dark pans will cause the base or bar to Bake and brown more quickly. 5. If using glass dishes, reduce oven temperature by 25 degrees and slightly decrease the baking time. 6. Use only the size of pan called for. The difference between an 8-inch square pan and a 9-inch square pan can mean the difference between a moist, chewy bar and an under baked, heavy failure. 7. Check baked goods at earliest time indicated. Over baking will dry out bars and squares. 8. If making a sticky or fluffy batter or base, wet your hands or spatula with water before patting or spreading the batter in the pan. 9. Let most bars cool completely before cutting. There are exceptions, however. Bars with a sticky filling need to have a knife run around the edge of the pan after being removed from the oven to prevent sticking. 10. Score chocolate-topped bars as soon as the topping is applied to prevent the chocolate from cracking later. 11. Use metal or plastic dry measures for measuring dry ingredients and glass wet measures for measuring liquid ingredients. 12. All-purpose flour does not need to be sifted. However, when a recipe calls for cake-and-pastry flour, the flour should be sifted and then measured. 13. Store nuts in the freezer to retain their freshness.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 fluid ounces Oz. boiling milk</li>
      <li>2 ounces Butter</li>
      <li>1 ounce Caster sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 ounces Fresh yeast or 2 tsp dries</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>1 Egg, separated</li>
      <li>14 ounces Strong plain flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cold milk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pour the boiling milk into a mixing bowl, stir in the butter and the sugar and leave mixture until lukewarm. Sprinkle over the crumbled yeast en let stand for 5 minutes (if using fresh yeast) or 15 minutes (if using dried yeast). Stir in the salt en egg white, then gradually beat in the flour to make a soft dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Retorn the dougn to mixing bowl, cover with cling wrap and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. When doubled in size, knock out the air and divide the dough in 16 even-sized pieces. oll each piece into a sausage shape, then form a ring; pinch the join firmly together. Place bagels on greased baking sheets, leaving enough space between them to let them rise and swell without touching each other. Cover loosely with a towel and leave them to rise for 10-15 minutes. Bring water to the boil in a large saucepan, reduce the heat until waters simmers, then gently drop in the bagels - only a few at a time to prevent them from touching and sticking together. Simmer each bagel for 10-15 seconds or until puffy and beginning to swell. Lift the bagels out of the water with a slooted spoon and return them to the baking sheets. Mix the egg yolks with the cold milk and brush the bagels with this mixture. Bake bagels for about 20 minutes in preheated (200 Centigrade/400 Fahrenheit) until golden and hollow sounding when tapped. Leave them to cool on a wire rack.

      <li>4 large Eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and Australian currency. In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in half as described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs about $10 to serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed potato and mini carrots etc and children can have 1. This is my first Recipe so here goes. Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts. Use Spiked Mallet to beat chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim any skin or get skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories. Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate. On second plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate. On third put the bread crumbs on it. Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg either by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs and put on plate. On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so that the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is very soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the cooking for the family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or what but they taste best that way.Just cook them and when the look cooked cut in half and if the meat is white(like chicken sould look not the colour of an uncooked fillet) they are cooked.I cook on medium heat in a frypan with some oil. Serving Suggestions: In the Colder months this meal is best served with Mashed potato and gravy as well as carrots and any other vegetables you like. In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger. I put the lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin pineapple ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a filling and tasty meal. Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated. CYA!</li>

      <li>3 pounds Chicken; in bite size pieces</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe is for a Cuban stew/soup that I used to enjoy con mucho gusto. This version of Ajiaco was prepared by Senora Garcia in her little store front restaurant on Collins Ave. in Miami Beach. Although this is not her exact recipe, it's the closest I could get to it. Melt the butter in a 6 qt. pot over medium heat. Cook chicken pieces in the butter until no longer pink. Remove chicken with slotted spoon and place in in a bowl. Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored with the paprika. Add stock, milk, yuca, corn, and chicken to the pot. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yuca is tender. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden. As an alternative, frozen corn on the cob will work, as well fresh frozen kernels. The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to this dish. If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims. This dish received rave reviews at the 1991 Blind Pass Marina Xmas Party. Posted to recipelu-digest by RecipeLu &lt;recipelu@geocities.com&gt; on Feb 03, 1998</li>

    <category>Vegan</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Corn/maize meal</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Soy flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Chili powder (optional)</li>
      <li>Sugar to taste</li>

      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Corn/maize was introduced to Africa from Latin America by the Portuguese, mainly to provision their slave ships. The grain was quickly accepted because it grew rapidly and undemanding in cultivation. The name 'maize' comes from 'mahiz', the word used by the Caribbean Taino Indians from whom the Europeans probably first learned about the crop. in North American the English settlers were shown it by local Indians. 'Corn' was a general name given to any grain, so they called it simply 'Indian corn'. Columbus noted that maize was "most tasty boiled, roasted or ground into flour". And in southern Ghana today a common food is 'kenkey', fermented corn/maize flour balls, wrapped in corn/maize leaves and steamed. Akpith, this recipe, is more straightforward. DIRECTIONS: =========== In a large saucepan, boil the water and then in half of the corn/maize meal and all the soy flour to make a thick porridge. Add the baking powder, chili powder if using and sugar; season. Cook this for 10 minutes over a low heat, stirring constantly. Then remove the pan and set aside to cool for 10 minutes or so. At this point, mix in the remaining corn/maize meal and combine thoroughly, adding water to produce a stiff dough. Now pour enough oil into a pan or wok to give a depth of around 2 inches (5 cms), and heat up. While it is warming mould the dough into balls about 1 inch (2.5 cms) in diameter. With the oil sizzling hot, slide 4 or 5 balls carefully into the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown. * Source: The World in Your Kitchen - by Troth Wells * Typed for you by Karen Mintzias From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1 Disolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Add sugar vinegar,salt,all purpose flour. Add remaining water until a creamy batter is formed. Place in a glass bowl,cover and let sit until it starts to ferment. About 3 days. It will take on a powerful boozy smell. Stir again until creamy and measure out what is called for in the recipe.Replenish starter with equal amounts of flour and water. Store in the fridge and bring to room temp before using. It says to allow to ferment for one week between uses but I don't.I do let it sit out overnight after I feed it. This starter took about 1 1/2 months to become really sour.

    <recipetext>
      <li>[I think this recipe assumes raw crabmeat to start; refer to instructions below about boiling crab meat and alter technique if using pre-cooked crab meat, perhaps by just boiling some ginger and cloves in small amount of water and adding a bit to flavor crab. -- cmt] Put crab meat in boiling salted water along with ginger piece and cloves. Cook about 15 minutes, until meat is tender enough to flake with a fork. Drain, flake and set aside. In a heavy pot, heat oil to a moderate temperature and add other ingredients in the following sequence, stirring for a minute or so between each: onions, ground ginger, tomatoes, tomato paste, green pepper, paprika, cayenne, and dried shrimp. Reduce heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are cooked. Add crab meat and stir another couple of minutes to heat it through. Then spoon the mixture into clean crab shells or ramekins (small individual baking dishes). Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of each crab and toast under an oven broiler, being careful not to let the crumbs scorch. Garnish with egg and parsley.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pre-heat oven to 375 F, 190 C, Gas mark 5. Drain the can of salmon. Flake the fish. Mix with the cheese, onions and red pepper. Set aside. Put the flour into a bowl, add the eggs, salt and basil. Mix well to form a soft dough. Divide into egg size pieces. Knead until smooth. Roll the dough pieces on a lightly floured board to a maximum 2mm / 1/10 inch thick or roll each piece through a pasta maker reducing the setting to 5 or 6 over 3 or 4 rollings. Cut the pasta sheets into 3cm / 1 1/2 inch squares. Put salmon filling onto one corner of each square then fold in half diagonally to make a triangular "pattie". Dry on silicone paper for 1 hour before cooking, turning each pattie over after 30 minutes to dry undersides. Put the soup into a casserole dish and drop the salmon patties into it. Cover with a lid and cook in the oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with the cheese. Continue cooking for a further 10 minutes. Serve with salad. Serves 4.

      <li>1 cup Tomatoes (canned are fine); crushed</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: TO COMPLETE STEW</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds (1 medium) yellow malanga</li>
      <li>1 pound (2 medium) white malanga</li>
      <li>1 pound (2 medium) boniato</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds (1/2 medium) name</li>

      <li>2 Semi-ripe (yellow) plantains</li>
      <li>1 Ripe (almost black) plantain</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make the broth: Cover the tasajo with cold water and soak it for at least 8 hours. (There is no need to refrigerate it.) Change the water and continue soaking for another hour. Drain again and rinse under cold running water. Put the tasajo in a large, heavy pot and add about 6 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 1 hour. Add the pork, beef brisket, and bay leaf, and let the three meats cook together until tender. Remove the pot from the heat and skim as much fat as possible from the broth. (If you have time, the best way is to refrigerate the broth overnight until the fat solidifies and then remove it.) Make the Sofrito: Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and saute the onions and green pepper until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes more. Add the pepper, cumin, and tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the sofrito to the broth and simmer, covered, while you prepare the vegetables. Complete the Dish: Peel the malanga, boniato, name, yucca, and calabaza and cube them. Cut the corn and green plantains&amp;nbsp;into 1 1/2-inch pieces. With a knife slit the skin of each piece of greenplantain by opening it away from the center as if you were taking off a coat. Sprinkle the plantain pieces with the lime juice. Slit the semi-ripe and ripe plantains lengthwise and slice them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch rounds. Do not remove their skins or they will disintegrate in the stew. Add the green plantains to the simmering stew. After about 15 minutes, add the semiripe plantains. After another 15 minutes, add the ripe plantains and let them simmer for about 10 minutes. Serve hot in soup plates or, cocido-style, with the meats, vegetables, and broth in separate dishes. ( Each diner removes the skin from the semi-ripe and ripe plantains themselves.)

      <li>From: John Levin &lt;jlevin@paonline.com&gt; Date: Fri, 02 Aug 1996 22:55:34 -0400 Here's another recipe which is a great favorite of ours, and which I clipped from a newspaper (Washington Post?) about 15 years ago. It's called "Albanian Chicken", although I've never seen an Albanian Cookbook, and have never seen another Albanian recipe, it seems like something my great grandmother would have cooked. The use of sauerkraut as a stuffing seems weird, but is characteristic of Middle European cooking. You often find it mixed with apples...here it's mixed with paprika and caraway seeds. The stuffing is sensationally delicious, and the chicken comes out extremely tender, every time. This is a recipe you have to cook to understand. Saute onion in oil until golden, stirring often. Combine sauerkraut, paprika, and caraway seeds with onion. Spoon as much kraut mixture as possible into the body cavity of the chicken. Reserve remainder of kraut for later Place chicken on roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Remove pan from oven, take chicken out. Pour off fat in bottom of pan. Spread remaining kraut in bottom of pan and set chicken in pan. Bake another 1/2 to 1 hour to brown. Season as desired. Leftovers make great sliced chicken and sauerkraut sandwiches. (If your mail program renders the times weird looking, they're 1.5 hurs for baking, and .5 to 1 hour for browning. The "=BD" is ASCII 189 and= represents "1/2" in US English.) JEWISH-FOOD digest 298 From the Jewish Food recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <title>Alan Ladd's Chuck Wagon Pepper Steak</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 London Broil (about 3 lbs.)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Unseasoned meat tenderizer</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Instant onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Marjoram</li>
      <li>1 cup Red wine</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Thyme</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Cracked peppercorns</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I don't know if this is exactly the Pepper Steak recipe requested earlier by I. Chaudhary, but it's one of our favorites. We eat this practically year-round and it's good hot or cold. Makes terrific sandwiches the next day. My mom found this recipe years ago in a magazine - Woman's Day or Family Circle, I think - that featured celebrity chefs. This was from Alan Ladd - and I probably just dated myself with that one (I'm really not that old!). For those who don't know who Alan Ladd was, he was a great movie star - best movie was "Shane" - at least a three hanky. Anyway, here's the recipe. Sprinkle meat with tenderizer, pierce with a fork (make lots of pierces so the marinade soaks thru), and place in baking dish. Mix rest of ingredients, except peppercorns, in a bowl and pour over meat. Lift meat up so marinade gets under it and can soak through. Marinate overnight (I usually start this in the evening and let it marinate overnight and all the next day) in refrigerator, turning frequently. When ready to grill or broil, remove meat from marinade and pound half the peppercorns into each side. Broil to desired doneness. Slice meat thinly and on the diagonal and serve. We always cook this on our grill outside. It has a wonderful taste - very peppery and if you like it spicier, add more peppercorns. I've given up measuring them. Hint: I take whole peppercorns, put them in a zippered heavy-duty plastic bag, and pound them with my meat mallet. We've also tried different red wines for the marinade - burgandy, sangria, etc. And get a bottle large enough to enjoy some while you're grilling!

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Sweet soy sauce. **Hot pepper sauce. ***Shrimp puffs. Note: Ingredients from Indonesia are available at many Dutch, Chinese, Vietnamese and Indonesian specialty stores. This...dish is good with Nasi Goreng (fried rice). Cut chicken into 8 pieces. Combine remaining ingredients, except shrimp puffs, in large bowl. Add chicken pieces; toss to coat. Marinate 2 hours at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Remove chicken pieces from marinade (reserving some of the marinade for basting and the rest for sauce). Roast, uncovered, at 400 F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until done, basting as needed. If browning too quickly, cover with foil. (In summer, barbecue over charcoal fire.) Heat reserved marinade with cornstarch until thickened and serve as sauce, if desired. Serve with shrimp puffs on the side. For these, simply deep-fry in hot fat or oil (375 F. on fat thermometer), draining at once on paper towels. The chips will puff up as soon as they hit the fat.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt the butter in a 6 qt. pot over medium heat. Cook chicken pieces in the butter until no longer pink. Remove chicken with slotted spoon and place in in a bowl. Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored with the paprika. Add stock, milk, yucca, corn, and chicken to the pot. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yucca is tender. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden. As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh frozen kernels. The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to this dish. If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.

Turn into loaf pans which have been generously buttered. Let stand in warm place for 30 minutes. Bake in oven preheated to 300 with a pan of water on floor of oven and rack as near as possible in middle of oven. Bake about 2-1/2 hours for medium-sized loaves watching carefully to see that they do not brown to quickly. Test with toothpick. Remove from oven, turn pans on sides and allow to set for a few minutes before taking from pans. When cold drip 2 tbsp. of wine over each cake. As soon as it is absorbed, wrap tightly in cellophane freezer paper and store in refrigerator or freezer. They improve with age.

      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Add sugar vinegar,salt,all purpose flour. Add remaining water until a creamy batter is formed. Place in a glass bowl,cover and let sit until it starts to ferment, about 3 days. It will take on a powerful boozy smell. Stir again until creamy and measure out what is called for in the recipe. Replenish starter with equal amounts of flour and water. Store in the fridge and bring to room temp before using. Directions say to allow to ferment for one week between uses but I don't. I do let it sit out overnight after I feed it. This starter took about 1 1/2 months to become really sour.

      <li>Preheat oven to 450F. Mix together the cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Using pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the consistency is grainy. Beat the eggs into the yogurt, then add to the cornmeal mixture. Add the cream-style corn and chili peppers, mixing just until moistened. Divide the batter evenly among 18 greased or paper-lined muffin cups. Bake until lightly browned, about 12 to 15 minutes. NOTES : A nice change from tacos or tortillas to accompany Mexican meals.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Red beans; cooked</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Ham; diced</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Hot link sausages; diced</li>
      <li>3 medium Jalapeno chile pepper; diced fine</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion; diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Creole seasoning</li>
      <li>2 Bottles Alaskan Amber Beer</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Celery; diced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Red bell pepper; diced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a crockpot or a heavy 3 quart pan place all the ingredients except the beans to a boil and simmer for an hour or two. Add the beans and simmer for another hour or two. Mash a few of the beans with a spoon to thicken the liquid.. Do not use a creole seasoning made with salt. The sausage and ham provide salt, and more may be added at the table. Add additional peppers if desired. Serve with rice. A table of tomato paste may be added near the end of the cooking time. NOTES : Beans can be cooked to minimize the undigestable sugars that cause gas. Put the beans in a pan and cover with water to 2 inches over the dry beans. Heat to boiling. Turn off the heat. Allow the beans to swell for about an hour. Drain the water off and refill with water to cover the beans. Bring to a boil and allow to set over night or for several hours. Drain the beans and refill with water to cover and simmer until tender (about 1 hour). Drain the beans and use in recipes calling for cooked beans.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim the fat from the stew meat, cut into bite sized chunks and brown it. Chop the onion and the jalapeno chili. Smash the garlic. Throw every thing but the beans into a pot, add water and simmer until meat is tender. Put the beans into a pot with water and bring to a boil, turn the heat down and simmer till the beans are done. Eat the chili and stomp the hell out of the beans. Don't confuse this with "Rebel Chile" which also has the beans stomped out of it. I brought this recipe back from Mexico and it was said to be the one that Mexico used when they taught Texans how to make chili at the Alamo. I understand that to this day Texans do not put beans in chili. TL: If it hasn't got a bean it must be Texas.</li>

      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups Pecans; coarsely ground</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon On; lemon rind</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Unsalted butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon On; lemon rind</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>For the torte: Whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar in a large bowl until blended. Stir in the pecans and the lemon rind. In a separate bowl beat the egg whites and the lemon juice until the whites are stiff, but not until dry peaks form. Stir one fourth of the whites into the yolk mixture. Gently fold in the remaining whites until blended. Scrape into a greased 9 inch springform pan that has been dusted with matzah meal. Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 1 hour or until firm to the touch in the center. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. The cake may sink in the center. For the glaze: Meanwhile, prepare the glaze. Combine the egg yolk, lemon juice, sugar; and butter or margarine in a small saucepan. Bring to simmering over medium heat, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon rind. Poke holes in the top of the cake with long skewers so that the glaze can soak in. With the cake still in the springform pan, spoon the glaze over. Let the cake stand a few minutes until the glaze seeps into the cake. Then remove the cake from the pan by running a thin knife around the rim to release the cake. Garnish with lemon rind, if you wish.

      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 large Bunch Italian parsley; chopped</li>

      <li>1/2 pounds Carrots; peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>2 medium Red onions; chopped</li>
      <li>1 can (14 1/2-ounce) diced tomatoes; drained</li>
      <li>3 cups Coarsely chopped savoy cabbage or Swiss chard; (ribs removed before chopping), up to 4</li>
      <li>10 slices Stale rustic bread; such as ciabatta, about 1-1 1/2 inches thick; see cook's note</li>
      <li>Salt; (sea salt preferred) and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Optional garnish: extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cook's note: You can save preparation time by using canned cannellini beans. Use two (15 1/2-ounce) cans. Use one can of beans whole; puree the beans in the other can. If you use canned beans, skip the first three steps of the recipe. 1. Place dried beans in a large pot. Cover with cold water and allow to rest overnight or for 8 hours. Drain. 2. Cover beans with cold water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 40 minutes or until beans are thoroughly cooked and softened, but don't overcook them. Drain beans, keeping the cooking water for later use. 3. Divide the beans in half. Leave half whole and process the other half until pureed in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Set aside. 4. Heat oil in a large soup pot on medium heat. Add parsley, garlic, celery, carrots and onions. Cook 30 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. 5. Add tomatoes and stir to combine. Cook 15-25 minutes. Add the whole beans and the cabbage (or Swiss chard) to the soup. Add enough water to cover the ingredients and bring to a boil on high heat. Simmer 30 minutes. 6. Add bean puree to soup. Stir to combine. Add enough boiling water to make the soup liquid. The exact amount of liquid will vary; you need to balance the amounts of liquid to the bread so that when the bread absorbs the liquid, the soup is very thick. Stir in bread and season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer 4 minutes, or longer if you wish the bread to further dissolve into the soup. If you wish, stir in a little extra-virgin olive oil, or use it as a garnish on top of the soup after it has been ladled into individual bowls.

      <li>Well, I'm just taking a wild stab here, but _The_Whole_Chile _Pepper_Book_ has a recipe for Papas a la Huancaina that is a dish of boiled potatoes topped with cheese and a sauce that is probably light green and creamy. Here's the sauce part: &lt;Curtis&gt; cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com Combine 2 Aji' or 3 Jalapen~o chiles, stems and seeds removed and chopped, 1 cup queso blanco or Munster cheese, and 1 cup heavy cream in a blender and puree until smooth. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and slowly add the cheese mixture, stirring constantly. Simmer the sauce for 5 minutes or until it thickens. If the sauce you remember didn't have cheese in it, try omitting it. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's the recipe for the Alaskan Rock Fish that I fixed for Hank's birthday. It's a very tender, mild white fish. I fried the fillets just like we do on Friday nights at our fish fry. The rock fish almost fell apart just turning them in the pan. Anyway, here's what I did. I floured the fillets. In a hot skillet, I melted about 1/2 stick of butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil (I use the Extra Virgin). Then I added a large clove garlic (minced) and about 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger (minced) and fried the fish for about 2-3 minutes (just until golden), turned it and seasoned (freshly ground sea salt and freshly ground black pepper). When the fish was golden on the 2nd side, I added the juice of 1 lime and served immediately. We didn't use any additional sauce (just the pan sauce) and it was really great! It's such a mild fish, I probably over did it with the garlic and ginger, but since I really like those flavors, it tasted great to me.

      <li>1/2 large White or yellow onion (coarsely chopped)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh thyme leaves (chopped; tough stems removed) (up to)</li>
      <li>3 Habanero chiles (to desired heat level) (see note)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Jamaican allspice (freshly ground)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Soy sauce (I use tamari)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vinegar (white or cider)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground black pepper (and pepper medley)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Sugar (I use raw sugar)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon (freshly ground)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Nutmeg (freshly ground)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Alan L. Edwards (ale@cisco.com) Put all ingredients except the scallions and thyme in a blender (or food processor) and puree. Then add the remaining ingredients and run the blender until the ingredients are well mixed, but not pureed. Makes a little more than 1 cup (enough for about 2 pounds of meat). Recipe scales well. Sauce can be kept refrigerated for a month, or frozen for a "long time". NOTE: Pickled Habaneros will do just fine if you can't find fresh; but I've found that they are not as hot as fresh ones (like maybe half as hot). You could also substitute Habanero-based sauce. But only use sauce that has a low amount of other spices (unless it's allspice). One of my latest variations uses about 3 Tbs of Alan's Special Mild Habanero sauce for flavor; and enough Habaneros or Scotch Bonnet sauce to bring the heat up to the right point. Jamaican jerk is usually made with Scotch Bonnet chiles, which are closely related to the Habanero (they are both of the species Capsicum Chinense), but harder to find (for me anyway). I'm not sure of the taste differences. + To judge the heat, taste when it's all mixed together and add more if you want it hotter. It's hard to tell how hot the final product will be the first time you make this, but you will get used to judging the heat eventually. For me, the right level is achieved when 1/8 tsp of the jerk sauce is enough to make me want water (but I'm used to capsaicin). CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>1 1/2 cups Bread flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Yeast</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Extra virgin olive oil Filling---</li>
      <li>10 ounces Chicken; skinless light meat</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Barbecue sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Barbecue sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Gouda cheese; smoked, shredded</li>
      <li>8 ounces Mozzarella cheese; shredded</li>
      <li>1/4 small Red onion; sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Parsley; chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the crust: 1. Put water, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in bread machine on dough cycle; allow to rise until doubled in bulk. This can also be made without a bread machine: Mix crust ingredients and knead for about five minutes. Let rise in warm place with no drafts. 2. Punch down dough and place in glass bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator overnight. 3. Punch down, separate into two balls, place in glass casserole dish, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rise until double in bulk. 4. Shape each piece into a 9-inch pizza. To make BBQ chicken: 1. Cut the chicken breast into 3/4-inch cubes. In a large frying pan, cook the chicken in olive oil over medium-high heat until just cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. Do not overcook. Set aside in the refrigerator until chilled through. Once chilled, coat the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the barbecue sauce; set aside in the refrigerator. To make the pizza: 1. Place the pizza stone in the center of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F for one hour before cooking pizzas. 2. Use a large spoon to spread 1/4 cup barbecue sauce evenly over the surface of the prepared dough within the rim. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon smoked Gouda cheese over the sauce. Cover with 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella. 3. Distribute half the chicken pieces evenly over the cheese (approximately 18 pieces). Place approximately 18 to 20 pieces of red onion over the surface. Sprinkle an additional 1/4 cup mozzarella over the top of the pizza. 4. Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone in the oven; bake until the crust is crisp and golden and the cheese at the center is bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. When the pizza is cooked, carefully remove from the oven; sprinkle 1 tablespoon parsley over the hot surface. Slice and serve. 5. Repeat with remaining ingredients for a second pizza. (The 2 pizzas may be prepared simultaneously if you are careful in placing the pizzas at opposite corners of your pizza stone.

Trim the liver and put it through a meat mincer together with the suet and onion. Add the soaked bread, the eggs and marjoram, and mix with a wooden spoon until well blended. The mixture will be very soft. Bring the stock to the boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the stock. Divide the dumpling mixture into 8 portions. With wet hands, shape a portion at a time into a ball and drop it into the stock. Simmer gently for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the dumplings are cooked through. Serve 2 dumplings per person in soup plates, together with some of the stock. Bavarian liver dumplings are almost as large as tennis balls. two of them make an ample portion, served either in a well-flavoured stock, or as a main course, garnished with fried onion rings and accompanied by mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.

Makes 10 to 15 minutes; serve in the paper; cutting an opening or lid in the top. Serve with the mango sauce, garnished with tarragon just before serving. SOURCES (12 Nov 97) Recipe by Katy Sparks, Executive chef, Quilty's, 177 Prince Street, New York, NY. draft: phannema@wizard.ucr.edu (13 nov 97) METHOD: Food that cooks quickly, like chicken and seafood, lends itself to the "en papillote" steaming technique (French for "in paper"). Choose a couple of flavorful ingredients, like shallots and truffles or parsley and lemon, and let them infuse a dish. The heart swells, and in a brief time creates a dish that is moist, with flavorful broth.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Rebecca Radnor &lt;japlady@nwu.edu&gt; Date: 6 Dec 1994 15:08:00 -0500 1. Lightly oil six 7- to 8-ounce capacity heat-proof cups. Set cups on trivet in steaming vessel, add hot water to come up to bottoms and leave on stove. 2. Heat milk and bay leaves to simmer in heavy saucepan over medium heat. Turn heat to low and simmer uncovered until reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes. Remove leaves, rinse and wipe clean. Set 1 fresh leaf or 1/2 a dried leaf in bottom of each cup, shiny side down. Set steamer over medium heat. 3. Combine eggs, egg white and Worcestershire in measuring cup. If not 1 cup, make up difference with more egg white. Turn into mixing bowl and whisk until blended, beating in as little air as possible (bubbles make holes in finished custard). Slowly pour through fine wire mesh strainer into clean bowl. Whisk in pepper and salt. Stir while pouring mixture into cups to keep pepper grains distributed. Pour gently, so leaf stays in place. 4. Lay foil over cups and cover vessel tightly. Steam, water barely simmering, until a metal skewer emerges clean just inside edge of cup, 17 to 20 minutes. Center should quiver slightly (eggs will continue cooking once out of steamer). Cover cups loosely with foil and refrigerate. May be unmolded after 4 hours or next day. When cool, cover cups tightly. 5. To unmold, run thin knife around custard, against sides of cup. Set small dish on top, turn over. If custard doesn't slip out, hold cup in place and whack gently but firmly on counter. Scrape any custard off leaf, remove scraps of custard and pour about 1 tablespoon caramelized sugar syrup over top. CARAMELIZED SUGAR SYRUP: 1. Cook sugar in a broad skillet (preferably non-stick) over medium heat, shaking skillet frequently, until sugar melts completely and turns rich amber, about 5 minutes. Do not allow to get darker, or syrup will be bitter. Remove from heat and cool 1 to 2 minutes. 2. Add 1/2 cup boiling water, stirring with wooden spoon. Cook over low heat, stirring, until hardened caramel melts-be patient. Turn into measuring cup and add water to make 1/2 cup. Refrigerate in tightly covered jar.

      <li>I just replaced the meat in the pasty recipe with pulled pork. It gave it a nice smokiness and with the BBQ sauce, it was great. I like flakey crusts and hate rolling pastry dough, so I use frozen pie shells. I get one pasty out of each shell. This makes 4 pasties. Mix all ingredients and put 1/4 in each pie shell. Fold the pastry over the filling to make half-moon shaped pies. Seal the edges and cut a couple of small slits on the top. Bake on a cookie sheet at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes, then reduce heat to 350F and bake 15 more minutes. Serve with BBQ sauce and a Stroh's. Ya, sure, you betcha.

      <li>For Sesame-Chili Sauce, in a small saucepan combine all of the ingredients except chicken. Cook over medium heat till bubbly, stirring frequently. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside. Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels. If desired, remove skin from chicken and discard. If using quartered chickens, break wing, hip, and drumstick joints so the bird will lie flat during cooking. Twist wing tips under backs. Place chicken, skin side down, on an uncovered grill directly over MEDIUM coals. Grill for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 15 to 25 minutes more or till tender and no longer pink. Brush with sauce frequently during the last 10 minutes of grilling. Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Heat any remaining sauce either on the grill or stove top; pass with chicken.

      <li>Mix all ingredients in deep dish or bowl..*** Amontillado sherry is best for this.. remember use only good sherry... not over salted cooking sherry.. if you cant drink it you shouldnt cook with it. This is enough for about 2 lb chicken which should marinate in this for several hours before it goes to the grill.. this can also be used as basting sauce but watch out for flare ups of oil on hot coals...

      <li>The day before serving, prepare the gougere dough: Heat the butter and milk in a medium saucepan to boiling. Remove from the heat. Add the flour and stir until the mixture is smooth and cleans the side of the pan. Add the eggs, one at a time - beating well after each addition. Sir in the cheese, mustard, salt and pepper. Cook, sitrring constantly,, over low heat just until the cheese melts. Butter a 15 x 10 baking sheet. Spread the dough over the entire sheet, building up the sides and leaving just a thin layer of dough in the middle. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day, prepare the filling: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the scallops and saute for just 1 minute. Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the onion to the skillet and saute for 2 minutes. Pour in the vinegar and heat until just 1 tablespooon remains. Pour in the cream, then stir in the mustards and sherry. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue to cook until the mixture is quite thick and reduced by about half. Remove from the heat and stir in the scallops. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Remove the gougere dough from the refrigerator. Spread the scallop mixture evenly over the dough. Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over all. Bake the scallop gougere until puffed and golden brown - 40-45 minutes. Let cool several minutes, then cut into bite-sized squares and pass with cocktails.

Heat 1 teaspoon on oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and lemon zest and cook, stirring constantly, for 20 seconds. Add the spinach and toss from time to time until wilted. Drain off the liquid and season with 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper. Keep Warm. 2. Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the scallops and saute until just cooked through, about 1 minute. remove the scallops from the pan and add the lemon juice and wine. Cook, scraping the bottom of the pan, for 15 seconds. 3.Remove from heat, toss in the scallops and season with the remaining salt and pepper to taste. Place a mound of spinach in the center of 4 plates and surround with scallops. Serve immediately. Serves 4.

      <li>Chef Jacky Pluton of Carlos in Highland Park prepares this dish with scallops in the shells, which are very difficult to obtain, and uses fried onion slices and fried rice noodles as part of the garniture. 1. Prepare the sauce. In a medium saucepan, cook the shallots in 1 tablespoon butter until they become translucent. Add the carrots, celery and bay leaf and cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring several times. Add the wine, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half. Add the stock and continue to reduce until the sauce has a light syrup consistency. Strain through a fine sieve and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside. 2. While sauce is reducing, prepare couscous and lentils by package directions. Combine and set aside. Recipe may be done ahead to this point. 3. Prepare scallops. Make a ring of the couscous-lentil mixture around the interior edge of 4 heat-proof soup plates and place in a warming oven. Reheat sauce. Add scallops to sauce and simmer until just firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet and saut the leek and truffles until the leeks are tender, about 2 minutes. 4. Make a bed of leek and truffles in the center of each plate. Arrange six scallops atop each bed and spoon sauce over the scallops and the couscous mixture. Garnish with thyme, tarragon and chives and serve at once with the same wine used for the sauce.

Place the pork cubes and bay leaves in a large, shallow noncorrodible baking dish. Add the molasses mixture and stir well to coat. Cover with foil and bake until pork is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the meat from the sauce and shred with a knife. Return the shredded meat to the baking dish and mix with the sauce. Slice the buns in half. Spoon the pork onto the bottom halves of the buns and mound 1/2 cup or more of the vegetable slaw on top. Cover with the bun tops and serve the remaining vegetable slaw on the side. Five-Vegetable Slaw: In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, red and green bell peppers, cucumber and scallions. Mix in the mayonnaise, vinegar, salt and black pepper. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days before serving. Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW &lt;shusky@erols.com&gt; on Mar 19, 1998</li>

      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>12 Cloves shallots</li>

      <li>Pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>True shallots (echalotes) are gradually becoming more widely available. They look rather like a large, loose head of garlic with glossy red-brown skin. Clean and peel 12 large Jerusalem artichokes. Put a little olive oil in a roasting pan, add the artichokes and roast in a medium oven until golden, a little caramelized and cooked through - about 20 minutes. Peel and slice 12 cloves of true shallots. Brush 28 scallops lightly with oil on both sides. Have ready 4 kaffir lime leaves (or substitute zest from the limes). Wash 8 wing beans (or substitute 4 very small bok choys about 10 cms tall - halve them lengthwise) and blanch in boiling water. Put the blanched vegetables in 4 large bowls (pasta bowls or similar), together with the whole roasted artichokes, and scatter the sliced shallots over the top. Meanwhile, in a saucepan com- bine 600 mL fish stock, the juice of 3 limes, Thai fish sauce to taste (about 2 tablespoons) and pepper to taste and bring to the boil. Heat an iron grill or heavy frying pan to a very high heat. Do not grease. Throw in the oiled scallops and sear them very quickly on both sides, so that they take colour on the outside but are barely warm inside. Divide the scallops between the soup bowls, top with the lime leaves and pour in the broth. Serve. From an article by Meryl Constance in The Sydney Morning Herald, 6/8/93. Courtesy Mark Herron.

      <li>3 tablespoons Tamari</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground chipotles</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt; (to taste)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Kit Anderson-- Nuts are very easy to do on a smoker. I have smoked them at cooler temps and high temps and they seem the best when done at 300F for 1/2 hour. That would be over the hot spot in an offset smoker. Any wood will do but hickory is especially nice. Get raw nuts in bulk at your health food store. Almonds, filberts, pecans, walnuts, peanuts are all good. The nuts need to be moist in order for the smoke to stick. 2 tablespoons of melted butter is right for 1 pound of nuts. You can also spray them with Pam. I recently have found 2 tablespoons of tamari soy sauce gives a wonderful subtle richness and will hold the smoke and spices. This also leaves them with a nice, dry coating. They will also need salt. Use a fine grain, not coarse kosher, to taste. After tossing with butter, tamari, or Pam, add your spices. You can get very elaborate or not. I like heat and will sometimes add some hot sauce to the butter. Try any of the seasoned salts. One recipe from the chileheads list asked for 2 TABLESPOONS of Dave's Insanity in the butter. These were hot. No...they were HOT. Weird thing was, that burned cat flavor from Dave's had vanished. Here's my recent effort that got a 'best ever' from the wife. Toss nuts with tamari in a bowl until completely coated. Add salt to taste and chiles. Spray baking sheet with Pam and arrange nuts in a single layer. Smoke at 300 for 1/2 hour stirring once after 15 minutes. Allow to completely cool so that they will be crunchy. These are great with beer, in oatmeal, and on salads. Posted to bbq-digest by wight@odc.net on Apr 4, 1998</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>I've posted the Bajan Beans and Rice recipe that I adapted from a recipe of Gabe Mirkin's before. This is one of my most favorite recipes and when I was making it today I found out halfway through that I didn't have any canned white beans. I forgot that I had bought some dried white beans intending to cook them up myself. No problem I had two cans of black beans and so decided to try the recipe with them. I liked it just as much and it made the dish even more colorful. The canned black beans I had weren't quite as mushy as the white beans I have used before -- the final product was less soupy. For those who may have missed the recipe, here it is again, this time with black beans: Heat 3 cups of water and mix in bouillon. Set aside. Note: any broth may be used, I just happen to like Better Than Bouillon especially. Saute garlic, onion, and red, green, and habanero peppers in 1/2 cup of broth in large pot for 10 minutes. Add remaining broth, tomatoes, and rice and simmer covered for 15 minutes. Add zucchini and simmer for an additional 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking. Add black beans, corn, and cilantro and cook an additional 5 minutes to heat through. Freezes well. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #302 by Michelle Dick &lt;artemis@rahul.net&gt; on Dec 21, 97</li>

Source: Lisa Clarke (Adapted from "The Cowboy Cookbook.") I had my parents over for dinner at the last minute tonight. I made this recipe which I've posted here before, but I varied it enough to warrant posting it again. As a side dish, I made minute rice. I microwaved it in chicken broth and a small amount of tarragon for 2 minutes. Nice and simple. For dessert I made this peach stuff that was somewhat like a milkshake ("Peach Nutmeg Frappe"). I got it from a "Cooking Light" special magazine that I picked up today. I was pleased with both recipes. * The Polka Dot Palace - The BBS for Homemakers! 1-201-822-3627 * Posted by LISA on 08-05-95 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #708 by Lisa Clarke &lt;lisa@gaf.com&gt; on Aug 1, 9</li>

However, if you use a McIntosh, you must shorten the cooking time. Core apples and remove top inch of peel. Make a shallow out through skin around centre of each apple to prevent skin from bursting. Place apples upright in baking dish or pie plate. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spoon into centres of each apple. Add water to cover bottom of dish. Bake, uncovered in 375 F for 25 to 30 minutes for less firm apples and up to 50 minutes for firm varieties or until apples are tender when pierced with a toothpick.

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Honey</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. If the chicken is frozen, thaw it overnight in your refrigerator. Rinse and clean the parts with cold water and dry well with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 350F. Cut the chicken breasts in half. 2. Combine the soup nut crumbs, ginger, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. 3. Beat eggs in a small bowl with the lemon juice and pour into a pie plate. Dip each chicken part in the egg mixture, then in the crumb mixture. Arrange in a single layer in a 9 x 1 3-inch baking pan. 4. In a 1-quart microwave-safe bowl, combine the preserves, wine, and margarine; microwave on high for 3 minutes. Or place in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour over the chicken breasts and bake for 1 hour or until the chicken is crisp. Serve with the Sweet and Sour Sauce. Sweet and Sour Sauce: This recipe begins with a 19-ounce jar of duck sauce, which comes in several flavors. It is a great flavor enhancer for marinades or dipping sauces. Pour over the baked chicken or pass at the table. 2 cups apricot-peach duck sauce 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1 tablespoon honey Microwave Method Place all the ingredients in a 1-quart microwave-;safe dish. Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir and microwave 1 more minute. Refrigerate and warm before serving. Conventional Method Place all the ingredients in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Refrigerate and warm before serving. Note: This recipe calls for chicken breasts only, but if you prefer dark meat, add kosher-for-Passover chicken parts. The soup nuts, or mandlen, come in a box and need to be ground into crumbs.

      <li>This Mix collection is from a company called Jewel. I don't think that their product is available any longer, so I have substituted just the word shortening for the Jewel shortening. I have had excellant results using either Crisco or (lately) Mazola shortening in these recipes. Unfortunately, I think the Jewel shortening has gone to the shortening heaven with Spry and several others whose name eludes me now. Thank goodness the recipes have survived! *4 Tablespoons Combine sifted flour, salt and baking powder. Stir well. Sift into a large bowl or pan. Add shortening. Use a pastry blender to distribute shortening throughout dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal and small peas.

      <li>4 Egg yolks</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Coat bottom and sides of 6 (6-ounce) custard cups with cooking spray; sprinkle with sugar. Set aside. Process apricot halves in blender or food processor until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides; set aside. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour until smooth. Cook mixture, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Add half-and-half and 1/4 cup sugar, whisking constantly. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat; set aside. Beat egg yolks at medium speed with an electric mixer until thick and pale; fold in apricots. Gradually stir one-third of hot mixture into yolk mixture; add to remaining hot mixture, stirring constantly. Cook over medium heat 2 minutes; stir in vanilla. Cool 15 to 20 minutes. Beat egg whites at high speed until foamy. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until soft peaks form. Gradually fold into apricot mixture. Spoon into prepared custard cups. Bake at 350° for 25 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve immediately with Almond Crème Sauce. Makes 6 servings. Almond Crème Sauce Serve any leftover sauce with fresh fruit, pound cake, or ice cream. Combine first sugar, cornstarch, and the extracts in a heavy saucepan; gradually stir in whipping cream. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Set aside. Beat egg yolks until thick and pale. Gradually stir one-third of hot mixture into yolks; add to remaining hot mixture, stirring constantly. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened. Pour through a wire-mesh strainer into a small bowl, discarding any lumps. Cover and store in refrigerator up to 3 days. Makes 1 1/2 cups. Notes: Cloud Craft Soufflés rely on stiffly beaten egg whites to create their magnificent proportions. Here are a few helpful tips for high and mighty soufflés. Separate egg yolks from whites while eggs are cold. To make your soufflé rise higher, let egg whites sit at room temperature 20 minutes before beating them. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Lift beaters up from bowl to see if peaks hold their shape. Fold egg whites into the soufflé mixture by cutting down through the center of the mixtures, across the bottom, and up the sides of the bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat folding and turning until mixtures are blended.

    <title>Bajan Black Bean Soup</title>
    <category>Soups</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Dried black beans; soaked overnight</li>
      <li>1 large Ham hocks; Or 2 small</li>
      <li>3 quarts Water; up To 3.5</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 large Onions; up To 3</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>3 small Fresh green peppers; (jalapeanos if preferred)</li>
      <li>8 Berries allspice coarsely crushed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Brown sugar; (or 1 t of molasses)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Tomato paste</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Creme fraiche or sour cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Salt Grated rind and juice from one lemon Put the drained beans and hock in a very large pan, cover with the cold water and bring gradually to a boil. Leave to simmer while you prepare the other ingredients. In a frying pan heat the olive oil, then gently fry the onion, garlic and chili with the allspice and lemon rind, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent. Add this mixture to the beans and go on simmering for 2 hours, by which time the beans should be tender. At this point add the sugar, lemon juice, and tomato puree. Cook for another 30 minutes. Add salt if necessary. Remove the hock, and pick off any meat. If you would like a smooth soup, as mine (the author) was, process the mixture in batches and return with the meat to the pan. Otherwise, for a rougher texture crush with a potato masher. If the mixture seems too thick at this stage, add more water and bring back to the boil for a minute or two. Ladle the soup into bowls, with a spoonful or two of cream stirred in, and serve with a crusty bread. If you are feeling lavish, a couple of spoons of dark rum added towards the end give a Bajan fillip. NOTES : Arriving stiff and crumpled inside and out after an eleven hour flight, this was my first taste of Bajan Cooking, and I ate it late at night trying to imagine the sea beyond a dark frieze of langourous palms. Dense but smooth, with a snap of chili, the soup was both homely and exotic, and very restoring. Barbados produces splendid ham and bacon, and a ham stock is what makes this different from other Carribean variants. Or, as here, use a hock, soaked first to remove some salt. &gt;From a book called FOOD MAGIC by Jocasta Innes. Posted by Troy Wade. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

      <li>1 Box angel-food cake mix</li>
      <li>4 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>6 Well frozen scoops reduced-fat Neapolitan-flavored ice cream</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Julia (julia@technonet.com) was kind enough to send the recipes I requested from Richard Simmons cookbook.... I thought I would share them with the list, in case there was anyone else who might like them. Ahead of time: 1. Preheat oven to 350. Line 2 15x10x1" jelly-roll-pans with parchment paper or foli and put aside. Prepare cake mix according to package directions and pour batter into each prepared pan, spreading evenly. 2. Bake one pan at a time on middle oven rack for 12-14 minutes, until top of cake is srusty and dry. Loosen edges with spatula and immediately invert cakes onto wire racks. Cool. Freeze one cake for other desserts, such as sundaes with frozen yogurt and fresh fruit. 3. Using biscuit cutter or kitchen shears, cut out 6 circles, about 3 1/2" in diameter, from the one cake. Remove scraps. 4. In deep, narrow-based bowl, bring egg whites to room temp. Using electric mixer, beat whites with cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Continue beating while adding sugar, 1 tbs at a time. Beat until stiff peaks form. Beat in vanilla. Set meringue aside. Just before serving: 5. Preheat oven to 500. Assemble Alaskas: Center frozen scoop of ice cream on each angel-food cake base. There should be a 1/2" of cake border around base of ice cream. 6. Spoon meringue over each portion of ice cream, dividing evenly. Working quickly, use spatula to completely enclose ice cream with meringue. Be careful to seal all edges. Meringue should be about 1/2" thick to meet with edge of cake. Swirl peaks on top. Use wide spatula and carefully lift and place Alaskas a few inches apart on baking sheet. 7. Bake 3 minutes or until meringue is lightly browned. Garnish with strawberries, if desired.

Can't say I've tried it myself; I only bring back Cockspur VSOR and I'm not about to cut it with sherry. As for amounts, I mostly saw 12 oz bottles of rum in the non-tourist stores and would use that as a starting point: Remove stems from the peppers and place in a bottle, then cover with rum and leave for two weeks. Strain and dilute to required "hotness" with sherry. CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #076 From the Chile-Heads recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

      <li>6 tablespoons Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Dry white wine</li>
      <li>3 Sprigs fresh parsley; stems removed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Potatoes; such as Eastern or Yukon Gold, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Fresh rosemary leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Plain bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Remove the tough outer leaves of the artichokes and, using scissors, cut the spines from the remaining leaves. Remove the stems, cutting at such an angle that the artichoke can stand up. Rub cut edges with lemon. 2. Place the artichokes in a pot large enough to hold them in one layer. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the oil over the top and pour in the wine as well as enough water to reach a depth of 1/2 inch. Add the sprigs of parsley, season with salt and pepper, cover, and cook over medium heat for 30-40 minutes or until the artichokes seem tender when pierced with a fork. 3. Meanwhile, place 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet along with the butter. When hot, add the potatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently until the potatoes are golden brown on all sides. Sprinkle with the rosemary, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. 4. When the artichokes are done, remove them with tongs and discard the liquid. Using a teaspoon or a paring knife, excavate the choke so that the centers are hollow and ready for stuffing. 5. Heat the broiler. Fill the artichokes with the potatoes and place in a baking pan. Combine the parsley, cheese, and bread crumbs and sprinkle over the potatoes with a generous dusting of black pepper. Drizzle the remaining oil over the top and broiler until the tops are lightly browned. SERVES 4 after 90 mins and moderate difficulty.

      <li>This is a great way to use up leftover baked beans, and the regularity with which this soup was served in Shaker communities indicates that they had a lot of leftover beans. The dish was an absolute staple, and I think it is really very good ... and certainly hearty. Put the beans, water, onion, and celery in a saucepan and bring to a boil for 30 minutes. They would rub this through a sieve, but I put mine through the food processor. Do the same with the tomatoes and add to the soup. Add the chili sauce and seasonings. Melt the butter and cook with the flour for 2 minutes to form a roux. Stir the roux into the soup and keep stirring over medium heat until the soup thickens a bit. You might also try mustard or horseradish for a variation. These additions were common in the Hancock Shaker community. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>x Favorite spices</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: dcross@pts.mot.com (Daniel Cross X8663 P5108). About the quickest tofu recipe I know is this one: Mix some flour (about .5 cup) with your favorite spices (I like cayenne). Press most of the water out of a block of tofu with a towel, then slice it up any old way. Dip the slices in soy sauce, then in the flour/spice mix, and place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-30 minutes (a toaster-oven is great for this). If you like them browned a little more, put them under the broiler for 5 min. before serving. From: samv@netcom.com (Sam Voeller). sort of a boring tofu user myself, but one recipe I have is so yummy I use it in all sorts of things. Preheat oven to 350 degrees (f) cut tofu (firm) into 1" cubes dip cubed tofu in soy sauce, and dust on all sides with fresh-ground black pepper set on lightly oiled (or non-stick) baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, turning once so that all sides are browned evenly. This gives the tofu some real, chewable texture, as well as a spicey zing. I use these tofu chunks in thick stews, or just over steamed veggies. rfvc Digest V94 Issue #200 Sept. 17, 1994.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Found this recipe in the Dec. 96 issue of Chile Pepper magazine. Sounds much like the Lottie's Seasoning which Romain is trying to duplicate. In a food processor, combine the onions, green onions, garlic and peppers and process to a coarse paste. Remove the leaves from the stems of the thyme, parsley, and marjoram. Place the leaves and the vinegar in a blender and liquefy. Combine the onion paste, vinegar mixture and the remaining ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for a whole week before using. The seasoning will keep in the refrigerator for at least six months. Yield: two to three cups.

      <li>Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact and cut off any hanging roots. Using a small, sharp knife, divide onion into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2" away. Cut each section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or petals, will begin to open. Remove onion from water and immerse into ice water, which will further the opening. Drain well by turning upside down on paper towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover. Put cracker crumbs or coating in bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat. Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cooked onion can be kept for a time in warm oven.

      <li>The name means simply 'fried chicken', and that is all it is. The marinade, however, gives it a characteristically Indonesian flavour. Marinate the pieces of chicken in this mixture for 2 hours, turning them from time to time. Strain the chicken, so that the marinade drips away from it. Then deep-fry the portions, 4 or 5 at a time. Chicken fried in this way is excellent with Nasi Goreng. [Nasi Goreng is fried rice. S.C.] Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London, 1986."

      <li>Wolfert writes: "If you run out of preserved lemons, or decide on just a few day's notice to cook a chicken, lamb, or fish dish with lemons and olives and need preserved lemons in a hurry, you can use this quick five-day method taught to me by a Moroccan diplomat's wife. Lemons preserved this way will not keep, but are perfectly acceptable in an emergency." With a razor blade, make 8 fine 2" vertical incisions around the peel of each lemon to be used. (Do not cut deeper than the membrane that protects the pulp.) Place the incised lemons in a stainless-steel saucepan with plenty of salt and water to cover and boil until the peels become very soft. Place in a clean jar, covered with cooled cooking liquor, and leave to pickle for approximately 5 days. From _Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco_ by Paula Wolfert.

    <title>A Bloomin' Onion</title>

    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Water; ice</li>
      <li>Water; boiling</li>
      <li>4 Eggs; beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Cracker crumbs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact and cut off any hanging roots. Using a small, sharp knife, divide onion into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2" away. Cut each section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or petals, will begin to open. Remove onion from water and immerse into ice water, which will further the opening. Drain well by turning upside down on paper towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover. Put cracker crumbs or coating in bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat. Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cooked onion can be kept for a time in warm oven. This recipe was posted some weeks ago. It did not include a sauce. If I remember correctly, the poster said to serve with Ranch Dressing for a sauce. I would just let my imagination go, on the sauce! I haven't tried this yet, even though it is tempting...I have to watch out for my husband's diet, so we try to stay away from fried things. Sorry, I don't know the name of the original poster, but that is his/her ID, after the recipe title. Barb Day From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Grated Orange Peel</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>* shallots work just as well, although you need more ** we really like coriander, so we put in a couple of teaspoons Melt butter in a saucepan, add spring onions and stir-fry 1 minute. Then add orange and lemon peel and coriander. Remove from the heat while you prepare cream and yoghurt. Pour cream into a small bowl and add yoghurt, salt and pepper. Mix well until smooth. Peel, stone and chop avocados (the size you chop the pieces is personal preference, but we usually chop into about 1.5 cm cubes). Add the avocado to the ingredients in the pan, pour yoghurt mixture over and very gently heat through. DO NOT BOIL or avocados will become soggy and sauce will curdle. Pour over pasta, toss and serve at once. Note: This sauce can be started in advance but the avocados should not be added until the last minute. For the two of us for dinner, we halve all of the ingredients, and use one medium to large sized avocado.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 bunches Turnip; collard, or mustard greens, (or a combination)</li>
      <li>3 Dried small; red peppers, (up to 4)</li>
      <li>1 cup Chicken stock or water; (up to 2)</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Salt pork; optional</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar; optional, (up to 2)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Tear off thick stems and place greens in the sink. Cover with water. Sprinkle a small amount of salt over greens and stir. Allow water to settle a few minutes. Carefully lift out greens and place in a colander or large bowl. (If you have a double sink, the other side works great.) Rinse out sink to eliminate any grit that may have dropped from greens. Return greens to sink and cover with water again. Allow any remaining grit to settle and unplug drain so that water runs out. Tear large leaves into pieces and place in a large stockpot, Dutch oven or saucepan with a lid. Without shaking off too much water, add greens to pan, along with whole, dried red peppers. It may be difficult to get all the greens in the pan, but cram them in. Cover pan with lid and place over medium heat. Cook just until leaves wilt and greens fit easily into pan. Add just enough water or chicken stock to almost cover greens. If desired, add salt pork. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until greens are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in sugar during last 10 minutes of cooking. Makes 10 servings. Posted to recipelu-digest by molony &lt;molony@scsn.net&gt; on Mar 10, 1998</li>

      <li>1 medium Roasting chicken</li>
      <li>2 Onions</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dark soya sauce</li>

      <li>1 cup Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe calls for 'tauco' which can be either salted black beans or salted yellow beans. Either can be found in a Chinese market as salted black bean or salted yellow bean sauce. Or you can track down Indonesian salted yellow beans and smash 'em up yourself. Thai markets carry them. Cut the chicken into serving pieces; wash, and dry. Slice the onions. Pound the garlic and the tauco into a smooth paste. Fry the onions in the oil for half a minute. Add the tauco, then the chicken. Stir well, so that every part of the chicken is coated with tauco. Put in the soya sauce and the rest of the ingredients. Cover, and simmer very gently for 45 minutes. Then take the lid off, and cook for a further 5 minutes to reduce the sauce. Serve hot. Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London, 1986." ISBN 0-907325-29-7. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; March 1 1993.

      <li>Date: Sat, 13 Apr 1996 14:22:58 -0400 From: dmg@csg.uwaterloo.ca Roast the garlic cloves, onion and tomatoes on a pan until the skin is burned, rotating them in the meantime. Peel the tomatoes, remove their hard parts and blend them with the onion and garlic plus 1/4 cup of chicken stock. On one spoon of oil, fry the puree for 2 minutes. Lower the heat and cook for another 5 minutes, until the puree get thicker or changes in colour. Add the remainder chicken stock and epazote. Add salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil and cook at medium heat for 15 minutes. Cut the tortillas in halves, and then each half in thin strips. Add 1cm of oil in a small pan. When it is hot, add the strips --few at a time-- and fry them for 3 minutes or until they are golden, flipping them once. Take out and remove excess oil. (It is important that the tortillas are dry, if you can not leave them drying the day before, put them in your oven at 120 Celsius for one hour). Cut the chiles in rings of 1cm and remove the seeds. Fry them in oil for one minute or until crunchy. Five minutes before serving, heat the soup, add the fried tortillas. Decorate each bowl with chile rings and avocado. Add cheese. Leave rest of avocado, chiles, cream and limes on the table for extra garnish. CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #293 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>1 Strip kombu; 6 - 8 inches long</li>
      <li>1 cup Buttercup squash; acorn or other winter squash, cubed but not peeled</li>

      <li>Wash beans, cover with water and soak for 6 - 8 hours. Put kombu on bottom of pot and cover with the squash. Next add soaked, drained beans. Add water to just cover the squash layer. Do not cover the beans at the beginning. Place the bean mixture over low heat and bring to a boil slowly. Cover after about 10 - 15 minutes. Cook until beans are 70 - 80% done, about 1 hour or so. The water will evaporate as the beans expand, add more cold water as required to keep level constant and make beans soft. When beans are nearly done, add sea salt, cook another 15 - 30 minutes. Transfer to serving bowl. Serve with brown rice. Posted to fatfree digest by "Jan Gordon" &lt;jan@gordon.com&gt; on Jun 1, 1998</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 pounds Semi-sweet chocolate; chopped (I use Callebaut)</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Smooth peanut butter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Chipotle chile purée</li>
      <li>4 large Eggs; room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Honey roasted peanuts; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>"x3" cake pan or springform pan</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425deg.. Cut a circle of baker's parchment or waxed paper to line the bottom of the cake pan or springform. Butter the bottom and sides of the pan, then insert the paper and butter it also. If using the springform, wrap the outside of the pan with tinfoil to make it watertight. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over gently simmering water. Remove from the heat, whisk until smooth, then whisk in the peanut butter and chile purée. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs until they are light and have increased in volume, two to three minutes. Carefully fold the eggs into the chocolate mixture in three batches until no streaks of egg are visible. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Pour about one inch of hot water into a larger baking pan and set the cake pan or springform in it. Place the pans in the middle rack of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the torte on a rack to cool. Sprinkle the chopped peanuts on the top of the torte, pressing very gently so they will adhere. When the torte has cooled, cover and refrigerate at least four hours or overnight. To unmold, dip a sharp knife into hot water, dry it, and run it around the edge of the torte pan. Immerse the base of the pan in hot water for a few seconds, dry it well, then turn it out onto a serving plate so that the chopped nuts become the crust. Presentation: I cut a chile pepper stencil out of parchment, place it on top, and dust it with powdered sugar or cocoa. Serve plain, with shortbread cookies or sweetened whipped cream.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/2 pounds Chicken, in pieces</li>
      <li>5 Shallots, peeled and finely sliced</li>
      <li>4 Garlic Cloves, peeled and finely sliced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground Coriander</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground Cumin</li>
      <li>1 pinch Of Sereh powder *</li>
      <li>1 pinch Of Laos powder *</li>
      <li>1 pinch Of grated Nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 small Cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>1 Bay Leaf</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>Oil for deep-frying</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put all the ingredients except Oil in a large heavy pan. Bring to a boil then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for about an hour, stirring occasionally Remove the chicken and leave to cool. Heat the Oil in a deep fryer to 350 deg. Fry the chicken a few pieces at a time for 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot. From "The Encyclopedia of Asian Cooking" Indonesian section by Sri Owen * Available at Asian markets and in the Asian section of some supermarkets. If you can't find them don't worry, the recipe will still work OK. The Javanese seem to like their chicken pretty well done and chewy. I prefer mine a little more tender and fry it for a bit less than ten minutes. It has been a while since I made this, but I believe about seven minutes is enough for me. This chicken is delicious and also good cold. Make lots of it. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Avocado Terrine</title>
    <category>Appetizers</category>
    <category>Fruits</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Avocado peeled, seeded mashed.</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dijon Mustard</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>Lemons to Squeeze</li>
      <li>1/2 pints Whipping Cream</li>
      <li>1 Avocado peeled, rubbed with lemon and sliced 1/2 inch thick. Sauce--</li>
      <li>3 Medium or 4 Large ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and seeded</li>
      <li>Squeeze of Lemon Juice</li>
      <li>1 ounce Heavy Cream</li>
      <li>Fresh Basil Garnish--</li>
      <li>3 Medium shrimp per serving. peeled, deveined, lightly poached.</li>
      <li>2 Basil Leaves (whole)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>As you cut avocados drizzle lemon juice on them so that they will not darken. Mash avocados in a bowl and add the mustard and worcestershire sauce. In a separate bowl lightly whip the 1/2 pint of whipping cream. The cream should be a little loose, soft peak stage is the technical term. Fold cream into avocado mixture. Place parchment paper in a standard bread pan so that there is enough paper to cover the top of the filled terrine. Spray the parchment with release spray. Fill the terrine with 1/2 of the mixture, and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove terrine from refrigerator, slice the extra avocado and drizzle lemon juice on it to keep it from darkening, place the slices on the top of the chilled mixture. Pour other 1/2 of the avocado melange on top. Drizzle some lemon juice on top and fold parchment paper over top. Refrigerate for 35 to 40 minutes. While the terrine is chilling, peel devein and barely poach the shrimp, let the shrimp cool in the poaching liquid if possible. Set the shrimp aside for the garnish. Separate nice looking basil leaves for garnish. Prepare the sauce; roughly cut the tomato into bite size pieces, place in a small frying pan or saucepan and stew them slightly. Add a little lemon juice and the cream, mix in a few stray leaves of the basil cut into strips. The goal is to quickly cook off some of the liquid. Let this sauce cool to room temperature or below before saucing the dishes. To unmold, sit the terrine in some warm water for 1 minute or less, and unmold onto a platter. Slice into 3/4 inch thick pieces and place the shrimp and basil on the plate with the terrine. Spoon some of the basil rich sauce over the top.</li>

Bake at 325 degree oven for one hour, then turn off the oven, do not open the door for one hour. If you have a self-cleaning oven, you will need to open the door just a little, and prop it open for the hour (I find a folded grocery bag is the right size). Remove from oven, and put the cake into the fridge (after it cools) for about 8 hours. Top with fruit- cherry pie filling, fresh or frozen strawberries, etc., then with a dollop of whipped cream.

      <li>Wolfert writes: "If you run out of preserved lemons, or decide on just a few day's notice to cook a chicken, lamb, or fish dish with lemons and olives and need preserved lemons in a hurry, you can use this quick five-day method taught to me by a Moroccan diplomat's wife. Lemons preserved this way will not keep, but are perfectly acceptable in an emergency." With a razor blade, make 8 fine 2" vertical incisions around the peel of each lemon to be used. (Do not cut deeper than the membrane that protects the pulp.) Place the incised lemons in a stainless-steel saucepan with plenty of salt and water to cover and boil until the peels become very soft. Place in a clean jar, covered with cooled cooking liquor, and leave to pickle for approximately 5 days. From _Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco_ by Paula Wolfert.

    <title>Avocado with Crab</title>
    <category>Salads</category>
    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Ripe avocados</li>
      <li>15 ounces Crab meat or</li>
      <li>1 pound Fresh crab meat</li>
      <li>8 Tb mayonnaise</li>
      <li>4 To 6 drops Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Finely minced, peeled celery stalks</li>
      <li>Salt, depending on the saltiness of the crab meat</li>
      <li>1 pinch White pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch Cayenne or</li>
      <li>1 drop To 2 drops Tabasco</li>
      <li>1 Head iceberg lettuce</li>
      <li>2 Lemons</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Split the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits. With a melon-ball cutter, gently enlarge the cavity toward the stem end. 2. With a fork, mash the avocado pulp which was removed. 3. Mix the pulp with 4 tbs. of the mayonnaise, salt if needed, pepper and cayenne or Tabasco. Gently fold in the crab meat and the celery. 4. Divide the crab mixture among the eight avocado halves. 5. Mix the Worcestershire sauce with the remaining 4 tbs. mayonnaise. With a pastry bag or a cone made from wax paper, pipe approximately 1/2 tbs. of the mayonnaise mixture on each filled avocado half. 6. Remove the outside leaves of the iceberg lettuce. Arrange the leaves on a serving platter. Cut the inside part of the lettuce into very thin strips and make 8 small nests on the leaves lining the serving platter. Place an avocado half on each nest. 7. Cut each lemon in quarters and garnish the serving platter with the slices of lemon. Serve. If desired, offer additional mayonnaise separately. CHEF'S SECRET: When you buy avocados, they should not be soft but, if pressed gently, should give about the same resist-ance as an orange. Once at home, pack each avocado in a brown paper bag and leave them at room temperature overnight. Of course, chill before serving. If you use canned crab meat, it is advisable to pick it over. Sometimes you may find a small piece of the shell. Definitely taste it for saltiness. Certain brands improve with a quick rinsing with water. If you have to rinse it, don't do it under the faucet. Place the meat in a sieve and dip the sieve in a small amount of water. Loosen the meat with one finger, then remove the sieve from the water and shake the meat dry. The flavor will not be destroyed, but the saltiness of the canning liquid will be gone. Enlarging the cavity of the avocados with a melon-ball cutter has two purposes; you have the subtle taste of the pulp in the crab mixture, and it is easier to arrange the filling without making it messy. Definitely peel the celery stalks for this dish with a potato peeler so that no strings get into the salad. The celery is needed for its crunchy texture to counterbalance the softness of the avocado and mayonnaise and the fleshy chewiness of the crab meat. If you do not care for the taste of celery, you can substitute peeled, seeded, finely chopped cucumber. Makes 8 servings.

      <li>Some errors that stop imports are very difficult to see and others are really quite easy. When you try to import IMPORT.ER1* or you import manually you got some error messages; the most common and frightening is "@ing at or before line #.." And you LOOK and just don't see ANYTHING. Well there IS something there that is not correct...and here is a list and examples of the most common errors. 1. The difference between l (the LETTER) and 1 (the NUMBER) is slight but MM accepts only NUMBERS in the quantity column. 2. A backwards slant 1\2 is INCORRECT...1/2 is fine. 3. A range of numbers is a NO NO...4-6 eggs won't do; pick 5... 4. The two digits in the UNIT OF MEASUREMENT column should include ONLY LETTERS. When in that column, hit F1 for a complete list of the only acceptable abbreviations. 5. Be sure that all the units of measure start on the ninth column. (9 spaces from the left) 6. The ingredient column can be only 39 columns long. Once you get used to these common errors your eye will pick it up quickly. I hope this helps... *NOTE: "IMPORT.ER1 is the file that MM creates (when you choose that option) to copy your flawed recipes. The ones that download with errors. Sometimes it is difficult to SEE what is wrong with them. This 'recipe' helps you pick up the common errors. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

NOTES: * This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but moist, loaf of banana bread. * If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you lower the oven temperature and cook for a while longer. Otherwise, the crust comes out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost undercooked. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: Preparation: 10 minutes; baking: at least 95 minutes.

      <li>1 Walla walla or maui</li>
      <li>1 Water</li>
      <li>1 Egg; beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Cracker crumbs</li>

      <li>1 Oil; for deep frying</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: DIP</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Thousand island dressing</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Horseradish; grated</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact; cut off any hanging roots. Using small, sharp fnife, divide onion into four sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and cutting toward root, stopping about 1/2 inch away. Cut each section twice. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or "petals" will begin to open. Remove onion from hot water and immerse into ice water, to help the opening. Drain well by turning opside down on paper towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover. Put cracker crumbs or coating mix in paper bag, add onion and shake gently to coat. Refrigerate for 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cooked onion may be kept for a time in warm oven. The "Outback Steakhouse" serves this with a delicious hot-hot sauce to dunk' in. They also add hot spices to the flour and/or coating mix.</li>

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: YELLOW CORNMEAL DUMPLINGS</li>
      <li>1 cup Ground yellow cornmeal</li>
      <li>3/4 cups All purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon White pepper</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: AZAFRAN SOUP</li>
      <li>6 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Azafran (see note)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons White pepper</li>
      <li>3 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>2 Yellow summer squash, diced</li>
      <li>3 cups Corn kernels</li>
      <li>1 Bunch spinach, washed and stemmed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the dumplings, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and sugar together in a bowl. Add the butter and milk and mix well to make a batter that is moist but not sticky. If the dough is too moist, knead in a little more flour. Divide the dough into 1" balls, flatten, and shape into small triangles. Pour the chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and drop in the dumplings. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, until tender and cooked all the way through. Remove the dumplings from the stock and set aside. For the soup, heat 2 cups of the water and the azafran in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Pour through a fine sieve, discard the azafran, and return the liquid to the saucepan. Add salt, pepper, stock, and the remaining 4 cups of the water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add squash, reduce the heat ans simmer 5 minutes. Add cork kernels and simmer another 5 minutes. Add dumplings and spinach, cook 2 minutes, and serve immediately. **Note** Azafran, also called Native American saffron my the American Indians, is an herb that is actually fine threads from the stigma of the safflower plant. Despite the name, azafran is not the same as saffron, which is an expensive spice derived from the crocus plant in the iris family. (Saffron can be substituted for azafran, though: use 1 pinch of saffran for 2 tablespoons of azafran). Azafran is commonly sold in Latin American markets and specialty herb stores. It can also be ordered by mail. It is best stored in a cool dark place and will last several months in a sealed plastic or glass container.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* the yolks rubbed through a sieve and the whites finely chopped. ** each cut about 1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long. In a deep bowl, mash the egg yolks and milk together with a spoon or table fork until they form a smooth paste. Add 1 tablespoon of the lime juice, the sugar and the salt. Then beat in the vegetable oil, a teaspoon or so at a time; make sure each addition is absorbed before adding more. Add the olive oil by teaspoonfuls, beating constantly. Stir the remaining lime juice into the sauce and taste for seasoning. With your fingers or a small knife, remove the skin from the fish and pick out any bones. Drop the fish into a bowl and flake it finely with a fork. Add the chopped egg whites and the sauce, and toss together gently but thoroughly. Just before serving, cut the avocados in half. With the tip of a small knife, loosen the seeds and lift them out. Remove any brown tissue like fibers clinging to the flesh. Spoon the fish mixture into the avocado halves, dividing it equally among them and mounding it slightly in the center. Arrange 3 strips of sweet pepper or pimiento diagonally across the top of each avocado and serve at once. Makes 4 servings.

      <li>1 First-cut brisket (5 lb) trimmed of all visible fat</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Corn oil</li>
      <li>8 Onion(s), thickly sliced separated into rings</li>

      <li>1 cup Dry red wine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Note: Make this a day ahead so you can skim off the fat. Preheat oven to 375øF. Cover both sides of brisket with lots of pepper. Over a medium flame, heat the oil in a heavy casserole or roasting dish and brown the brisket on all sides. Take the brisket out of the pan and set aside. Add the onions to the casserole and cook them over medium-high heat. As you stir them, scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the casserole. cook the onions for about 15 minutes, or until they are thoroughly browned. Add the carrots, garlic, and bay leaves; stir for another 1-2 minutes. Take the casserole off the burner and carefully put the brisket back into its nest of vegetables. Coat the brisket on both sides with tomato paste. Sprinkle more pepper, and a little salt, over the tomato paste. Pour the tomatoes and red wine into the bottom of the casserole. Cover the casserole tightly, first with a layer of foil and then with the lid. Let the pot roast cook on the middle rack of the oven for 3« hours. check the liquid level in the casserole frequently; if it gets too low, add a little water or beef broth. When the meat is tender, take it out of the oven. Keep the meat covered while you cool it to room temperature. Then put it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, spoon off all the solidified fat you can. Discard the bay leaves. Bring the meat back to room temperature and reheat it ÄÄ along with its juices and the vegetables ÄÄ either on top of the stove or in the oven. When it's hot, slice it on the diagonal and serve with the pan juices and vegetables spooned over. Add salt at the table, if needed.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Contemporary Southwest, The Cafe Terra Cotta Cookbook (1995), by Donna Nordin The avocado in this soup turns a traditional potato-based soup into something the French would never recognize! Because of the richness of the avocado, we can use milk instead of cream without compromising the texture. 1. Steam or boil the potatoes until soft and let cool. Meanwhile, roast, peel, and seed the poblanos. Roast the tomatillos and onions until lightly charred. 2. Combine the roasted vegetables and potatoes in a food processor or blender and puree. Add the serrano chile, cilantro, mint, lime juice, ginger, and avocado and puree until smooth, adding milk as necessary to facilitate the blending. Transfer to a bowl or storage container and thin to the desired texture with milk. Add salt and pepper to taste. Chill. 3. Taste the chilled soup for seasoning and correct if necessary. Mix the sour cream and chipotle chile together and drizzle over each bowl soup as a garnish. Note: Normally this soup is served cold, but it can be reheated gently and served warm. If you prefer it less spicy, leave out the chipotle garnish and simply garnish with a sprig cilantro. Typos by Brenda Adams EAT-L Digest 18 July 96 From the EAT-L recipe list.

Divide meat into four equal portions (5 ounces each)- with cupped hands, toss one portion of meat back and forth to form loose ball. Pat lightly to flatten into 1 -inch-thick burger, 3 1/2 to 4 inches across, using fingertips to create pocked, textured surface. Repeat with remaining portions of meat. 2. If grilling, heat enough coals to make hot fire. When coals are hot and covered with white ash, spread them in single layer. Position grill rack and lid-, heat until rack is very hot, about 5 minutes. Place burgers on rack-, cover and grill, turning once, to desired doneness as follows: 3 minutes per side for rare, 4 minutes per side for medium-rare, 5 minutes on first side and 4 minutes on second side for medium, and 5 minutes per side for well done. If pan-broiling, heat skillet over medium-high heat. When skillet is hot (drops of water flicked into it evaporate immediately), add parties and cook, turning once, to desired doneness, using same times as if grilling.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put all the ingredients except Oil in a large heavy pan. Bring to a boil then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for about an hour, stirring occasionally Remove the chicken and leave to cool. Heat the Oil in a deep fryer to 350 deg. Fry the chicken a few pieces at a time for 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot. From "The Encyclopedia of Asian Cooking" Indonesian section by Sri Owen * Available at Asian markets and in the Asian section of some supermarkets. If you can't find them don't worry, the recipe will still work OK. The Javanese seem to like their chicken pretty well done and chewy. I prefer mine a little more tender and fry it for a bit less than ten minutes. It has been a while since I made this, but I believe about seven minutes is enough for me. This chicken is delicious and also good cold. Make lots of it. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 ounces Stale country bread; broken up into 3/4-Inch Chunks</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Fruity olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Black pepper; freshly ground</li>
      <li>2 cups White wine</li>
      <li>2 pounds Small clams (about 40); well scrubbed</li>
      <li>2 pounds Mussels (about 40); wellscrubbed</li>
      <li>4 cups Clam juice or fish stock</li>
      <li>1/2 bunches Cilantro; leaves only</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 pound Large shrimp (about 18); Shelled &amp; Deveined and cut into 1/2-Inch Piece</li>
      <li>6 Free range eggs (optional); lightly beaten</li>
      <li>Cilantro sprigs; for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl, toss the bread cubes with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread the bread on a baking sheet and toast until golden, watching carefully. Set aside. In a large saucepan or stockpot, combine the wine and the clams. Cover the pan and, over medium highheat, cook the clams, shaking the pan occasionally, for about 10 minutes. Remove the clams to a bowl with a slotted spoon, discarding any that have not opened. Add the mussels and cook in the same way, again discarding any that do not open. Transfer the mussels to the bowl with the clams, and remove all the meat from the shells. Set the shellfish aside. Discard the shells and add the liquor from the bowl back into the pan with the wine. Strain the cooking water through a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth, return it to a clean pan, and add the clam juice. Meanwhile, in a mortar and pestle or a food processor, process the cilantro, garlic, and 3/4 teaspoons salt to a paste. Transfer the mixture to a large, heated serving tureen with a lid and stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Bring the wine and clam juice mixture back to a simmer and add the cooked shellfish and the raw shrimp. Simmer for 3 minutes, add the bread chunks and stir for 2 minutes more, or until the soup is very hot. Drizzle the egg mixture over the top, stirring slowly in a circle. Immediately pour the simmering mixture into the tureen, stir to mix, and ladle the soup into heated bowls at the table. Garnish with a sprig of cilantro.

      <li>3 Acorn squash</li>
      <li>4 Carrots, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 Onion, thinly sliced , I used one smallish</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cans Chicken stock</li>
      <li>Curry powder</li>
      <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 C. table or heavy cream, I used 1/2 C. light nondairy (up to 1/2)</li>
      <li>Lime wedges (really makes the soup!)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut squash in half and remove the seeds. Put a pat of butter or margarine in the cavity of each half and roast in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes or till soft. Let cool. In the meantime, sauté the carrots and onions in a little olive oil until caramelized. Add chicken stock and deglaze the pan. Add about 1/2 can of water to the stock. Remove squash from the shell and put in saucepan with the stock. Mash down the vegetables as much as you can. Add seasonings to taste, then purée in blender or food processor. Return to pot; add cream; and adjust seasonings. Serve with wedges of lime to be squeezed on top. Note: I did not put the butter or margarine in the cavity of the squash halves -- didn't miss it -- soup was still very rich. I also simmered the soup for a little while to soften the vegetables a little more after adding the squash.

      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Chocolate Chips</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>[Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra 4ozs of plain chocolate, and got perfect results. I think as long as you're using *really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa solids, it doesn't really matter!] Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. Set aside. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place the plain and the unsweetened chocolates in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow to heat for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Keep at room temperature until needed. Place the soft light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating on medium, and stopping to scrape down the bowl after incorporating each addition. Add the vanilla essence and beat on medium for 30 seconds. Add the melted chocolate and beat on low for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the bowl and beat for an additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips, and beat on low until thoroughly combined - about 20 to 30 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula. Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons of batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking sheets. Place the biscuits on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. Allow the biscuits to cool for 5 to 6 minutes on the baking sheets. Transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack to thoroughly cool before storing in a sealed plastic container. Repeat this procedure until all the biscuits have been baked. Makes 3 to 3. 5 dozen biscuits &gt;From Marcel Desaulniers' "Death By Chocolate" Recipe By: Paul Vincent &lt;KNDUSR18@MSMAIL-GATEWAY.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 3/4 pounds Bittersweet chocolate</li>
      <li>2 cups Heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 ounces Orange liqueur</li>
      <li>2 ounces Almond liqueur</li>

      <li>(optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Shave chocolate into tiny pieces; set aside. In a large saucepan, blend together cream, liqueurs and vanilla and heat until the cream begins to scald; remove from heat. Add the chocolate pieces and whisk for 2 to 3 minutes or until the ganache is satiny and smooth, with no lumps of cream or chocolate. Transfer ganache to a bowl and allow to cool (at room temperature) below 90 degrees. Cut butter into small pieces and add, piece by piece, to the ganache, stirring well. Allow ganache to cool and become somewhat firm. Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Using a SMALL ice cream scoop, shape ganache into mounds and place them on the parchment. Refrigerate until set. Dust hands with cocoa powder; shape each mound into uniformly-shaped balls and refrigerate. Melt chocolate in a double boiler. Arrange two sheets of parchment paper on work surface. Drop a truffle into melted chocolate, retrieve with fork and tap the truffle 4 or 5 times against the surface of the chocolate to get rid of the excess. Then scrape the sides of the pan with the fork and drag the fork (with the truffle on it) across one sheet of parchment paper to remove more chocolate. Place the finished truffle on the clean parchment; repeat with remaining truffles. If desired, use melted white chocolate to pipe designs onto tops of truffles.

      <li>~ -- Thai fish sauce, called nam pla. This amber-colored, odoriferous liquid - -- used in everything from stir-frys to sauces -- cooks down to a mellow undertone. Better brands are lighter colored and less pungent; Squid is a recommended brand. ~ -- Dried shrimp. Salty and intensely flavored, these are used primarily as a seasoning ingredient. Usually sold in 4-ounce packages, dried shrimp should be plump and resilient, retaining enough moisture to evidence a little "give" when squeezed. ~ -- Thai chili sauce, called sriracha. This is a sort of chili-garlic "catsup," fiery, flavorful and slightly sweet. Huy Fong Foods Inc., of Rosemead, Calif., makes an excellent sriracha, packaged in a clear plastic squeeze bottle with a drawing of a rooster on the front. ~ -- Holy basil. Thai cooking uses many different types of basil, and this type is intensely mint-flavored. Unless you grow it yourself, holy basil can be difficult to find; fresh mint makes a good substitute. ~ -- Thai "bird" peppers. These little hot peppers, usually green but sometimes red, pack a notoriously powerful punch and are not for sissies. Serrano peppers make a good substitute if Thai chilies are unavailable. ~ -- CHILIES-IN-VINEGAR SAUCE (Makes about 1/2 cup); hot and sour ingredient in soups and pad thai etc. 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar 1/2 tablespoon Thai fish sauce 12 small Thai chilies, or 3 serrano chilies, finely sliced Combine all of the ingredients in a small serving bowl. Let stand for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to develop. &gt;Adapted from "True Thai --- The Modern Art of Thai Cooking" by Victor Sodsook with Theresa Volpe Laursen and Byron Laursen (William Morrow and Company Inc., New York, 1995).

      <li>If your machine offers the option, use the "light crust" setting as the crust browns more due to the sugar content of the jam. Try to use a jam with a high fruit content &amp; few additives. This recipe can be baked on the regular, rapid bake, or timed settings. I have a DAK Turbo II &amp; baked it on the reg setting. It was one of the few loaves that have turned out really well lately...think my DAK is dying; just today ordered a ZOJI from Irwin. The bread kept VERY well in a Rubbermaid container...was nice &amp; fresh for a whole week (I forgot about the last couple of slices!).

    <recipetext>
      <li>These recipes come from Culinary Cyber Sleuth. The first one has no chiles but think they would make a wonderful addition and it sounds great for a special holiday occasion, as does the 2nd one. Put butter in 8-inch square baking pan. Set pan in 350 degree oven to melt. Shake pan to distribute butter evenly. Slightly beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Pour into pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or until eggs begin to set. Sprinkle with cheese and chiles. Draw a wide metal spatula across bottom of pan several times to break up mixture. Bake, breaking up mixture again several times for 5 more minutes or until of desired doneness. Serve with tomato sauce, ketchup or chili sauce, if used. Garnish with sliced tomatoes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Marinate artichoke hearts with italian herbs and some balsamic vinegar. I myself add a teaspoon or so of olive oil (someone will be coming to measure me now, I'm sure). Stir artichoke hearts and rest of ingredients together. DON'T put in so much white stuff that it is too moist because the mushrooms will release moisture and then it will get gross. Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes in a French White Corning Ware casserole. If you put it in anything else it will explode. This is great as a dip, or in a pita sandwich. I hope you like it, and I promise not to post too often until I actually learn to measure and write :-) Posted by Cynthia Barnes &lt;cbarnes@bigcat.missouri.edu&gt; to Fatfree Digest [Volume 13 Issue 13] FATFREE Recipe collections copyrighted by Michelle Dick 1994.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large saucepan, combine beer, water, bay leaves, peppercorns and salt. Bring to a boil; add fish, then cover and turn off heat. Allow to cool, covered, about 15 minutes or until fish is opaque throughout. (Fish cooks as liquid cools; this extra-gentle method of cooking keeps the fish flesh intact.) Meanwhile, cook fresh corn in boiling water until tender; drain, then cut kernels from cobs. Combine corn, tomatoes, bell pepper, poblano chile, hot chiles and green onions; set aside. Then prepare dressing: whisk together salsa or tomatillos, lime juice and oil. Taste and adjust heat; if not hot enough (or if you used tomatillos), add jalapeno juice to taste. Toss dressing with vegetables and place mixture in a large salad bowl. Drain fish; gently flake and scatter around edge of bowl. Sprinkle with cilantro, if desired. Makes 4 servings. NOTE: If you have fresh tomatillos on hand, you may use them in place of the canned variety. Remove the husks and stems, then steam fruit about 5 minutes until soft; chop enough to make 1/4 cup.

    <title>About Vanilla Beans</title>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Information from the 1996 Old Farmer's Almanac, "What You Can Eat To Achieve True Peace of Mind", by Ken Haedrich The vanilla orchid is a member of the plant family known as Orchidaceae and is the only orchid that produces edible fruit. The beans grow on a thick vine that flourishes in warm, moist climates within 25 degrees of the equator. The vanilla plant begins to bear fruit when it is three or four years old. Eight to nine months after pollination, the beans are golden yellow and ready for harvest and curing. It takes about five to six pounds of green, freshly picked vanilla beans to make one pound of properly cured beans. There are basically two ways to cure the beans: in the sun or over a fire. Using the solar method, beans are spread in the hot sun by day and wrapped in blankets and placed in wooden boxes by night. The sweating process is repeated over and over for six months, until the beans have lost up to 80 percent of their moisture content. This method produces superior results and is used in Madascar, Mexico, the former Bourbon Islands, Tonga, and Tahiti. The wood-fire curing method, used in Indonesia and Bali, takes only two or three weeks, but produces a dry, brittle bean with a smoky flavor, generally considered inferior. When you buy a vanilla bean at your market, the black, oily, smooth pod you're buying is a cured bean. When you purchase a bottle of pure vanilla extract, you're buying beans whose flavor components have been dissolved in a solution of water and alcohol. By law, pure vanilla extract must contain at least 35 percent alcohol by volume. Anything less is labeled a flavor. Pure vanilla extracts come in a variety of folds, or strengths. The Food and Drug Administration has established that a fold of vanilla is the extractive matter of 13.35 ounces of vanilla beans to a gallon of liquid. Strong, pure extracts, such as four-fold, are primarily used in mass food production. What about imitation vanilla? ~---------------------------- Not only is pure vanilla expensive, but demand also far exceeds the world's supply of the real thing. Stepping in to fill the void is the chemist, who has come up with a variety of imitations made from synthetic vanillin, the organic component that gives vanilla its distinctive flavor and fragrance. Most synthetic vanillin is a byproduct of the paper industry, made by cooking and treating wood-pulp effluent. But since vanillin is only one of more than 150 flavor and fragrance compounds found in pure vanilla, the chemist has yet to match the subtlety with which Mother Nature has endowed the real thing. How to tell a good bean when you see one. ~---------------------------------------- Quality is key. To truly experience all the flavor and fragrance vanilla has to offer, you have to seek out quality beans and extracts. Generally speaking, look for beans that are supple and aromatic. Tahitian beans are moister and relatively short and plump, with thin skins and a floral aroma. Bourbon beans (so called because they originate in Madagascar, Reunion, and the Comoros, formerly known as the Bourbon Islands) are slightly dryer, contain more natural vanillin, and have thick skins (the flavor has nothing to do with bourbon whiskey.) Stay away from dry, brittle, or smoky-smelling beans. Depending upon quality and variety, single vanilla beans retail from about $1.50 to $10 apiece. Vanilla beans should be kept at room temperature in an airtight container. Don't refrigerate them or they may develop mold. Vanilla beans last up to two years. Especially if you cook with it often, it is more economical to buy pure vanilla extract by the pint, or even the quart, and share it with a friend. The best pure extracts contain no caramel and artificial color and little or no sugar. Store extract at room temperature, tightly closed. It will keep up to five years.

    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Beat butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar and baking soda; beat till combined. Beat in egg yolk and vanilla. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Stir in any remaining flour with a wooden spoon. 2. To shape, press a small amount of dough firmly and evenly into a teaspoon (not a measuring teaspoon). Gently tap the side of the spoon onto a greased cookie sheet to remove the shaped cookie. If necessary, use your finger to help remove dough from spoon. Reshape dough slightly on cookie sheet, if necessary. Makes 32 ovals. 3. Bake in 350 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes or till lightly browned. Cool on cookie sheet. Combine chocolate and shortening in a small saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat till chocolate is melted; cool. 4. Place about 1 teaspoon strawberry jam or hazelnut butter on the flat side of a cookie; top with another cookie, flat side down. Repeat with remaining cookies. Dip wide end of each cookie sandwich into melted chocolate. Place on wire rack over waxed paper. Sprinkle with chopped nuts. Insert a pretzel piece at top of cookie for stem, if desired. 5. To store, place cookies in a single layer in a shallow container; refrigerate up to a week. NOTES : For acornlike oval shapes, mold the dough with a flatware teaspoon, not a measuring teaspoon.

      <li>Date: Sat, 25 May 1996 13:41:55 -0400 From: BobbieB1@aol.com To prepare Cookies: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Sift together cocoa, flour, baking soda and salt onto a sheet of wax paper. Set aside. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom of a double boiler over medium heat. Place semisweet and unsweetened baking chocolate in top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top pan with plastic wrap and heat 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir chocolate until smooth. Keep at room temperature. Place brown sugar and butter in the bowl of electric mixer and beat on medium speed 1 minute. Scrape down bowl and beat on high speed additional 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Add eggs, 1 at a time, while beating on medium, stopping to scrape down bowl after incorporating each addition. Add vanilla and beat on medium 30 seconds. Add melted baking chocolate and beat on low 10 seconds more. Scrape down bowl and beat additional 30 seconds. Add flour mixture and beat on low until thoroughly combined, 20 to 30 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer, add chocolate chips and mix thoroughly with rubber spatula. Using 2 baking sheets, portion 6 to 8 cookies per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons batter per cookie onto each sheet. Place pans on top and middle shelves of oven. Bake 18 to 22 minutes, rotating sheets from top to bottom about halfway through baking time. Cool cookies on pans 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack. Repeat procedure until all cookies have been baked. Cool cookies thoroughly before storing in sealed plastic container. To prepare Chocolate Ganache: Heat cream, butter and sugar in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve sugar. Bring mixture to boil. Place chocolate in stainless steel bowl and pour boiling cream over chocolate. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature. (Ganache can be made 3 to 4 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat, stirring. Bring to room temperature before using.) Put ganache in a serving bowl, so guests can dip their cookies in before eating. Makes about 2 1/2 cups. Adapted from "Death by Chocolate" Marcel Desaulniers. Makes 3 to 3 1/2 dozen cookies. From the Oregonian's FOODday, 2/9/93.

Stir in the squash puree, carrots, orange rind, all-purpose flour, 2/3 of the whole-wheat flour, the spices and salt. Mix in enough of the remaining whole-wheat flour to form a soft dough. Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes). Place in a greased bowl and let rise, loosely covered, in a warm place until doubled in size (40-60 minutes). Punch down. Knead on a floured surface for about 5 minutes. Shape into loaves and place in greased (8 1/2"x4 1/2") loaf pans. Let rise, loosely covered, until doubled in size.

    <category>Import</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>32 ounces Bittersweet chocolate; tempered</li>
      <li>16 ounces White chocolate; tempered</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Spread white chocolate on a sheet of acetate in a layer about 1/16-inch thick. Drag a cake comb through the chocolate to create alternating lines. Return the excess chocolate to the bowl. When the chocolate stripes are firm but not hard, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of dark chocolate over the white chocolate. Let the dark chocolate set until firm but not hard, then place a piece of parchment paper on top of the chocolate. Pick up the plastic by a corner and carefully wrap it around any tube. Secure the plastic closed with tape and place in the refrigerator. Place a piece of bubble wrap, bubble side up on your work surface. Randomly drizzle white and dark chocolate onto the plastic. Use an offset spatula to spread the chocolate in an even layer to create a marbled effect. Place the plastic in the refrigerator. Spread some white chocolate onto a sheet of acetate. Pull a wood grain tool through the chocolate to create a wood grain design. Let the chocolate set slightly, until firm but not hard. Cover the design with dark chocolate and use a spatula to gently spread it into layer that is about 1/8-inch thick on one end and graduates to a 1/4-inch thick at the other end. Let the chocolate set until firm yet pliable but not hard and set it inside a tall round container. Place it in the refrigerator. Cover a piece of textured plastic with about 1/4-inch thick layer of chocolate to create any desired size and place in the refrigerator. To unmold all of the chocolate pieces, remove them from the refrigerator and just gently peel away the plastic. Keep the unmolded pieces in the refrigerator until you are ready to put the sculpture together. Use the melted chocolate to "glue" the pieces together. Arrange the chocolate pieces as if you were arranging flowers of different varieties. Let your natural artistic eye guide you in the design.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>NOTE: Acorn squash seeds taste similar to pumpkin seeds except that the hulls on the squash seed are smaller. Therefore they are less dry tasting than pumpkin seeds and don't get caught in your throat as easily. Cut uncooked squash in half and scoop out seeds. Clean pulp and strings off the seeds in a collander under running water. Set the seeds on a towel to dry. Preheat oven to 350 deg. The seeds in a small bowl. Either melt margarine and pour onto seeds or put solid margarine into bowl and mix with you hands (my preferred method). Spread seeds evenly on a cookie sheet. Place in oven and cook 10 min. or until just starts to turn brown. Recipe by: James M. McDonald Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #262 Date: Tue, 24 Sep 1996 22:48:19 PST From: jmcd@juno.com (James M.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1 x See Below Flour: All-purpose flour is the most widely used flour. It contains a special protein called gluten the structure builder of bread. When mixed with liquid and kneaded or beaten, the gluten stretches and gives elasticity to the dough by trapping bubbles of gas formed by the yeast. Some flours, such as rye and whole wheat, lack sufficient gluten and usually are used in combination with all-purpose flour. Self rising flour, which already contains leavening and salt, is not often recommended for yeast breads. However, all recipes were tested with self rising flour; adjustments are indicated when necessary. Yeast: Yeast is a live plant that gives off a gas that makes dough rise: It is very sensitive-too much heat will kill it, but cold will stunt its growth. Yeast is available in several forms: regular active dry yeast, quick-acting active dry yeast and compressed yeast. All of our recipes have been tested with dry yeast. Most of the recipes follow the traditional method of dissolving the yeast in warm water (105 to 115F). However, some recipes yield better results by mixing the yeast with the flour, then beating in very warm water (120 to 130F). Liquids: Water or milk are the most commonly used liquids. Water gives bread a crisper crust; milk, a velvety texture and added nutrients. Sweeteners: Sugar, honey or molasses provide "food" for the yeast, enhance flavor and help brown the crust. Salt: A flavor agent that is needed to control the growth of the yeast and prevent overrising, which can cause the bread to collapse. Fat: Added to contribute to tenderness and flavor. Eggs: For flavor, richness and color, eggs are sometimes added. Source: Betty Crocker's Cookbook, 6th Edition From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>

      <li>Heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the seeds and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time, until a rich orange color is obtained. Cool, strain and store in a covered jar in the refrigerator. It will keep for several months. If the seeds are cooked too long, the orange color will change to a golden color and much of the flavor is lost. Very stale seeds will give off all their color in one minute of cooking. Watch the saucepan carefully and remove it from the heat immediately the color begins to lighten.

    <category>Spreads and</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Dungeness crab meat; picked over (lump crab meat is ok)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Old bay seasoning</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground thyme</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Dry mustard</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground white pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cayenne pepper powder; optional</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fine dry breadcrumbs; unseasoned</li>
      <li>1 Egg; beaten</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sliced green onions or fresh cilantro; whichever you prefer</li>
      <li>2 ounces Crab fat; (if available and optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large bowl gently fold all the ingredients together adding the bread crumbs last. Try not to break the crab meat up into small pieces. Depending on how moist the crab mixture is you may want to use less. The less bread crumbs you can use as a binder the better the crab cakes are in my opinion. I would not add more than a quarter cup. Chill the mixture covered 1 or 2 hours in the refrigerator and they will form a better cake when you are ready cook them. This is very important. Not only will they form a better cake but the consistency will be nicer. To cook use enough mixture to form a large silver dollar sized cake and saute lightly in oil about 1/2 inch deep ( I prefer a good olive oil ) until golden brown, turning once. These can be served hot or cold as a main entree or appetizer. Makes about 12 cakes depending on the size. NOTES : Combination of recipes made 3/28/93-10/2/93-3/26/94 and 7/19/97 I prefer Dungeness crab meat but will use Blue Crab select lump meat when available. This is my favorite crab cake as of this writing. I am beginning to use Japanese Panko in my crab cakes as it seems to be lighter.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Acorn squash, ~1-1/2 lb ea</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Small Brussels sprouts</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Diced onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Fennel seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried marjoram</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Minced fresh sage</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh orange juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Freshly grated pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups Cooked wild rice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F). 2. Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp. In a large baking dish, place the squash, cut side down, with about 1 inch of water. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes. 3. Pour about 2 inches of water into a large stockpot. Place a collapsible steamer in the pot, cover, and bring to a boil. Place the Brussels sprouts in the steamer, cover, and steam for 5 to 7 minutes, or until tender. Set aside. 4. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over low heat. Add the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the fennel, marjoram, sage, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper, and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the cooked wild rice and the Brussels sprouts and heat through. 5. Spoon the wild rice and Brussels sprout mixture into the squash cavities. Serve immediately. I often microwave the acorn squash by placing in a shallow glass pan with about 1/2-inch of water, covering with saran wrap and nuking for about 10 minutes or until tender.

      <li>12 ounces Semisweet baking chocolate, broken</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To prepare Cookies: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Sift together cocoa, flour, baking soda and salt onto a sheet of wax paper. Set aside. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom of a double boiler over medium heat. Place semisweet and unsweetened baking chocolate in top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top pan with plastic wrap and heat 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir chocolate until smooth. Keep at room temperature. Place brown sugar and butter in the bowl of electric mixer and beat on medium speed 1 minute. Scrape down bowl and beat on high speed additional 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Add eggs, 1 at a time, while beating on medium, stopping to scrape down bowl after incorporating each addition. Add vanilla and beat on medium 30 seconds. Add melted baking chocolate and beat on low 10 seconds more. Scrape down bowl and beat additional 30 seconds. Add flour mixture and beat on low until thoroughly combined, 20 to 30 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer, add chocolate chips and mix thoroughly with rubber spatula. Using 2 baking sheets, portion 6 to 8 cookies per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons batter per cookie onto each sheet. Place pans on top and middle shelves of oven. Bake 18 to 22 minutes, rotating sheets from top to bottom about halfway through baking time. Cool cookies on pans 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack. Repeat procedure until all cookies have been baked. Cool cookies thoroughly before storing in sealed plastic container. To prepare Chocolate Ganache: Heat cream, butter and sugar in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve sugar. Bring mixture to boil. Place chocolate in stainless steel bowl and pour boiling cream over chocolate. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature. (Ganache can be made 3 to 4 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat, stirring. Bring to room temperature before using.) Put ganache in a serving bowl, so guests can dip their cookies in before eating. Makes about 2 1/2 cups. Adapted from "Death by Chocolate" Marcel Desaulniers. Makes 3 to 3 1/2 dozen cookies. From the Oregonian's FOODday, 2/9/93.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Use loaf pans of anodized aluminum, darkened metal glass for bread with well-browned crusts. Shiny cookie sheets or muffin cups produce sweet rolls u tender, golden brown crusts. Stagger loaf pans on a lower shelf of the oven so they do not touch sides of the oven or each other. The top of each pan should be level with, or slightly above, the middle of the oven. If baking round loaves on a cookie sheet, place the sheet on the center rack. Doneness is determined by tapping the crust. The loaf will have a hollow sound when done. Remove loaves from pans immediately and place on wire racks away from draft. to cool. For a shiny, soft crust, brush just-baked loaf with margarine, butter or shortening. STORING Bread and rolls can be stored in airtight containers in a cool dry place for 5 to 7 days. Refrigerate only in hot, humid weather. Breads can be stored, tightly wrapped in moistureproof or vaporproof material, labeled and dated, in the freezer for 2 to 3 months. To thaw, let stand wrapped at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.

    <title>About Yeast Breads - Yeast Doughs</title>

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1 x See Below There are basically two kinds of yeast doughs-kneaded and batter. Both doughs need to rise before shaping and baking. To let dough rise, cover and keep in a warm, draft-free place. If necessary, place covered bowl of dough on wire rack over a bowl of warm water. Kneaded dough: Kneading develops the gluten and results in bread with an even texture and a smooth, nicely rounded top. After first addition of flour has been beaten in, dough will be very soft and will fall in "sheets" off rubber spatula. The second addition of flour makes the dough stiff enough to knead. Mix in only enough flour so dough leaves side of the bowl. To knead, fold dough toward you. With heels of hands, push dough away with short rocking motions. Give dough a quarter turn; repeat. When dough is properly kneaded, it will feel elastic and the top will be smooth with some blisters appearing on the surface. Dough should rise until double. Test by pressing fingertips 1/2 inch into dough. If impression remains, dough has risen enough. Punch down center of dough with your fist. Fold dough over and form into a ball. This releases large air bubbles to produce a finer texture. If dough is not sufficiently kneaded, the bread will be coarse, heavy, crumbly and dry. Batter dough: Batter breads are really shortcut no-knead yeast breads. Because less flour is used, the dough is stickier; instead of being kneaded, it is beaten with a mixer with the first addition of flour. The batter is generally not shaped but spread in the pan. The bread has a coarser texture and pebbled surface. REFRIGERATING YEAST DOUGH Yeast dough made with water (except. plain bread dough) can be refrigerated up to 5 days. However, if milk and at least 1/4 cup sugar are used, refrigerate no longer than 3 days. After mixing dough, grease top well. Cover with moistureproof wrap, then a damp cloth. Keep cloth damp during storage. When ready to bake, shape dough; let rise until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Bake as directed.

      <li>Ingredient Group: HEAT SCALE - MEDIUM</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive heavy saucepan, allow to steep for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring mixture to a low and gentle boil while stirring continuously. Remove saucepan from heat and allow to cool thoroughly. Strain through a very fine sieve and pour the strained oil into a bottle and cap tightly. This oil will remain up to 6 months if it is refrigerated and capped tightly. This is a MEDIUM HOT condiment. This oil is used both to color and to flavor dishes. Use it in place of vegetable oil for South American recipes. Use only annatto (achiote) seeds that are bright-reddish in color; seeds that are brownish are old and have probably lost much of their flavor.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Soak the beans overnight in cold water, changing the water once. Rub the beans between the palms of your hands to free the outer skins, which should float to the surface. Scoop off the skins and discard. Drain the beans. Puree the beans and onion in a food processor. Season with salt and pepper and chili. Using 2 soup spoons, form the bean mixture into small egg shapes. Press a dried shrimp into the center of each one, and press the bean mixture round to secure it. The shrimp should still stand proud. Heat the oil to 350 degrees and fry the fritters in small batches until golden brown all over. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a low oven until they are all fried.

      <li>1 teaspoon Lemon juice</li>

      <li>2 cups Oil</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Finely chopped pistachios *</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cardamom</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note: Instead of pistachio nuts, walnuts may be used if desired. Dissolve sugar in water in heavy pan over medium heat. Bring to the boil, add lemon juice and saffron and boil for 10 minutes. Cool and strain into a 25 cm (10 inch) pie plate. Keep aside. Break eggs into a casserole dish about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. The size and flat base are important. Add salt and mix eggs with fork until yolks and whites are thoroughly combined - do not beat as eggs must not be foamy. Heat oil in an electric frypan to 190 C (375 F) or in a 25 cm (10 inch) frypan placed on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or burner. Have ready nearby a long skewer, the plate of syrup, a baking sheet and the nuts mixed with the cardamom. A bowl of water and a cloth for drying hands are also necessary. Hold dish with eggs in one hand next to the pan of oil and slightly above it. Put hand into egg, palm down, so that egg covers back of hand. Lift out hand, curling fingers slightly inwards, then open out over hot oil, fingers pointing down. Move hand across surface of oil so that egg falls in streams from fingertips. Dip hand in egg again and make more strands across those already in pan. Repeat 3 to 4 times until about an eighth of the egg is used. There should be a closely meshed layer of egg strands about 20 cm (8 inches) across. Work quickly so that the last lot of egg is added not long after the first lot. Rinse hands quickly and dry. Take skewer and slide under bubbling omelet, lift up and turn over to lightly brown other side. The first side will be bubbly, the underside somewhat smoother. When golden brown lift out with skewer and drain over pan. Place omelet flat in the syrup, spoon syrup over the top and lift out with skewer onto baking sheet. Roll up with bubbly side inwards. Finish roll should be about 3 cm (1 1/4 inches) in diameter. Put to one side and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat with remaining egg, making 7 to 8 rolls in all. Though depth of egg diminishes, you will become so adept that somehow you will get it in the pan in fine strands. When cool, cut kabaubs into 4-5 cm (1 1/2 to 2 inch pieces and serve. These keep well in a sealed container in a cool place. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH6176 Saute the corn with the salt and pepper, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside to cool. Cut the avocados, bell pepper and roasted poblanos into 1/4 inch dice. Add to the sauted corn along with the scallions, vinegar and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Mix well and let sit 20 to 30 minutes to blend the flavors. Serve at room temperature. Corn relish can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator up to 1 day. To make 2 to 3 days in advance, mix all the ingredients except the avocado and store in the refrigerator. Add the avocado shortly before serving. Yield: 6 cups Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. (If you are rushed, you can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits. Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins. Posted to bbq-digest by wight@odc.net on Feb 17, 1998</li>

Toss together the zucchini, chiles, garlic, and lime juice in a small bowl. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Dust a work surface with cornmeal, and place the pizza shell on it. Drizzle the olive oil over the shell, then spread the zucchini mixture on top. Top with the cheese, spreading it evenly over the zucchini. Scatter the parsley or cilantro over the cheese. If you are using a baking stone, sprinkle it with cornmeal. Transfer the pizza to the baking sheet, pizza pan, or baking stone. Bake the pizza until the crust is lightly golden and the cheese bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the avocado in half, pit and peel it, and cut it lengthwise into thin slices.

Garnish with grilled vegetables, if desired. Notes: Hominy Grill on Rutledge Avenue, Charleston, SC. "Wehani rice and avocado salad. Wehani rice is a hybrid of brown rices developed at Lundberg Family Farms in California (www.lundberg.com). It's a light clay color and splits a little when cooked. 'Wehani rice is nutty and unhulled, kind of chewy, and it has some texture to it,' Stehling says. It's a nice pairing with the smooth, cool avocado." -- AB Hanneman: Recipes provided by "Ann Burger" &lt;www.charleston.net/&gt; on July 30, 1997, converted by MC_Buster.

      <li>2 pounds New potatoes; scrubbed</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Prepared horseradish</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh dill sprigs loosely packed thick stems removed</li>
      <li>3 Celery ribs; strings removed cut in 1/4" crescents (1 cup)</li>
      <li>2 medium Avocados* or 1 lg. avocado</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lime juice; freshly squeezed</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Choose avocados that are firm, with just a slight give. If the avocado is soft enough to hold an indentation, it's overripe and won't have the rich nutty flavor that you want for this salad. Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer. Cut potatoes in half; place them in the steamer basket. Cover and steam until they are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the heat and allow them to cool slightly. While potatoes are cooking, whisk oil and vinegar together in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt; set aside. When potatoes are cool enough to handle without burning your fingers, cut them in 1" cubes. Toss them in the oil and vinegar so they are coated well, and set them aside to cool to room temperature, tossing occasionally. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, yogurt and horseradish. Mince the dill and add it to the sour cream mixture, stirring well. When potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add celery and toss to combine. Then add the sour cream mixture; toss again. Halve, pit and peel the avocados. Cut them into 1" cubes; place in a small bowl with the lime juice. Toss so the cubes are moistened with the juice. Then add the avocados, with all of the lime juice, to the potatoes; toss gently until they are well distributed and coated with the dressing. Add pepper and additional salt to taste, and either serve immediately or chill for 30 minutes and then serve. While Loomis says that this salad does not keep well and shouldn't be counted on for leftovers, she says that it's one of the most popular potato salads she's ever made. Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

    <category>Salads and</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Avocado</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Chipotle Hot Sauce; at room temperature, or canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Warm water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sundried tomatoes; (oil packed) drained and chopped</li>
      <li>1 Lime</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Skin the avocado, cut it in half lengthwise, and remove the pit. Slice the halves lengthwise into 6 to 10 thin slices, and fan them out on small plates (3 to 5 slices per serving). Combine the chipotle sauce, water, and sundried tomatoes in a blender, and puree. Spoon a fine, decorative line across the fanned avocado slices. Cut the lime in half. Squeeze a bit of juice from one half of the lime over the top of each fan; cut the other half into 4 thin slices. Garnish the plates with lime slices and serve. Note: Avocado should be ripe, creamy, and of the Haas variety (the nubbly black avocados, not smooth the green-skinned ones, which can be watery). A delicate, deep red line of hot sauce painted across the avocado is visually dramatic, and the spiciness accentuates the avocado's cool smoothness. This dish makes an elegant and very easy first course for a dinner party.

      <li>In a bowl add sugar to eggs and gradually pour in vinegar. Stand the bowl in a pan of boiling water and stir until the mixure begins to thicken, then turn off the heat and continue to stir. When the mixure is thick, remove bowl from pan and continue stirring for one minute. Season and cool. Whip the cream till it holds a soft shape. Place 3 lettuce leaves on a plate. Halve, seed, peel the avocados. Place avocado half on the leaves round side up. Fold the cream into the dressing. Coat avocados with the dressing. Sprinkle with paprika and serve. Tom's comments: I find the vinegar taste to be overwhelming. You may want to remove one tb of vinegar or double-triple the sugar. The vinegar taste does lessen with time, but I would not want to bet a meal on doing things that way. I WILL do this again (I like it!) and shall try the things I stated above.

      <li>4 Hass avocados; diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 cup Superfine sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Heavy cream</li>
      <li>6 Pink Meringue Shells; (Recipe included)</li>
      <li>Toasted pumpkin seeds; coarsely ground for garnish, optional</li>
      <li>Blackberries for garnish; optional</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: PINK MERINGUE SHELLS</li>
      <li>Unsalted butter; for parchment</li>
      <li>1 cup Egg whites; 5-6 eggs</li>
      <li>1 drop Liquid red food colouring</li>
      <li>1 cup Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups Confectioner's sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Press avocados through a sieve into a large bowl, using a rubber spatula. Add sherry and 1/2 cup sugar. Stir to combine. 2. Whip heavy cream with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until soft peaks form. Fold whipped cream into avocado mixture. Divide between meringue shells. Top with one or more garnishes, if desired. Pink Meringue Shells: (makes 8-10) 1. Heat oven to 200 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, and lightly butter. Place egg whites in the bowl of electric mixer with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium speed until soft peaks begin to form. Add food coloring. Gradually add granulated sugar, and beat until stiff, but not dry. Slowly add confectioners' sugar, and fold in with a rubber spatula. 2. Transfer meringue mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a #6 large star tip. Pipe the meringue into 3-inch round disks. Then pipe two layers of meringue around the edges of each disk to form a shell. Transfer to oven, and bake until dry, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from oven, and carefully separate the meringue shells from the parchment paper, and cool on a wire rack. NOTES : The attractive combinations of colors and textures makes this a rather romantic dessert. In fact, the Aztecs considered the avocado a sacred fruit possessing mystical romantic properties.

      <li>1/2 Bakje tuinkers</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Translations: "achterham" is a nice sliced lunchmeat-type ham. For a vegetarian dinner, omit this; or, maybe, replace with mushrooms. "tuinkers". Hmmm...I really don't know the English name for this, or recall seeing anything similar. It's in the cress family, but smaller-leaved than watercress. You buy a little box (the bakje) that is filled with a sponge-like block. The tuinkers are sprouting from that, maybe one inch high. You take you kitchen shears or a knife and cut off what you want. Anybody know what this is? They're good sprinkled in a salad. I suppose you could use some kind of sprouts, maybe mixed, with radish sprouts included for the peppery taste. Peel the avocado and remove the seed. Cut into chunks and place in food processor (or blender). Wash the lemon. Into the processor, finely grate half the peel, avoiding the white part. Add the juice from half the lemon to the processor (other half not used). Add the Boursin and koffieroom to the processor. Whiz till smooth. Pour into a small saucepan. Warm over low heat from about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the ham into strips. Cut the tunikers from their bed. Stir into sauce. Add S&amp;P to taste. Serve over a shaped pasta. Penne was good, but maybe try something a bit smaller.

      <li>1/4 cups Light rum</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Confectioners sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>from "Maurice's Tropical Fruit Cook Book" by Maurice de Verteuil (some modifications in directions made) Cream sugar and butter together. Add eggs; mix well. Add avocado puree; mix well. Lastly, add buttermilk. Combine spices, salt, soda and flour. Gradually, add dry ingredients to wet beating well; it should be on the stiff side. Add dates, raisins and walnuts. Turn into a greased 9x9 inch baking dish and bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean. Combine cream, rum, salt and sugar and beat until stiff. (Of course, you must have your bowl and beaters chilled to accomplish this!). Chill. Serve a "dollop" of this cream on each piece of avocado cake. NOTE: This recipe can be doubled and baked in a 9x13 inch pan. The cooking time remains the same. I have never made the cream topping. I prefer to make a simple glaze with confectioners sugar, lime juice and milk, although keeping the cake "plain" is just fine. This is a lovely, moist, mildly spicy, old fashioned cake. People will guess that it is a carrot or zucchini cake if they don't know what the "secret" ingredient is. The batter is a lovely shade of green, but the cake bakes up a brown color.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR STRAWBERRY SALSA</li>
      <li>1 Fresh serrano or jalapeno chili</li>
      <li>1 cup Finely chopped strawberries</li>
      <li>1 cup Finely chopped white onion</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Finely chopped fresh coriander</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sugar if desired</li>
      <li>3 5-inch corn tortillas</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 Firm-ripe avocado</li>
      <li>2 8-ounce grilled chicken breasts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wearing rubber gloves, remove stems, seeds, and ribs from chili and chop fine. In a bowl stir together chili and remaining salsa ingredients. Salsa may be made several hours ahead and chilled, covered. Stack tortillas and cut them in half. Cut stacks crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick strips and in a heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Working in two batches, fry tortilla strips until crisp and golden, about 30 seconds, and with a slotted spoon transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle fried tortilla strips with salt to taste. Halve the avocado, removing the pit, and peel. Slice each half lengthwise into 6 wedges. Slice chicken into 6 wedges and fan ,with the avocado, onto 2 plates. Spoon about 1/2 cup strawberry salsa over each fan and mound crispy tortilla strips alongside. Yield: 2 servings STRAWBERRY CREME CARAMEL TART Recipe By: Cooking Live Show #CL8911 Categories: Cooking Live, Import Creme caramel: 1 1/4 cups whole small strawberries (about 30), trimmed 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 large whole egg 3 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon vanilla Pastry crust: 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 1/2 tablespoons packed brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces and softened slightly 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons ice water Garnish: small strawberries Make creme caramel: Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Spread strawberries on a baking sheet and bake in middle of oven 30 minutes to dry slightly. Transfer baking sheet to a rack to cool strawberries. Increase temperature to 350 degrees F. In a dry heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Immediately pour caramel into a 9-inch glass pie plate, tilting plate to coat bottom and sides evenly. Put pie plate in a baking pan. In a saucepan heat cream just to a boil and remove pan from heat. In a bowl whisk together egg, yolks, vanilla, and a pinch of salt until combined well and in a stream add warm cream, whisking. Skim off any froth and carefully pour custard into pie plate. Arrange strawberries decoratively on their sides in custard (custard should completely cover strawberries) and add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up side of plate. Bake creme caramel in middle of oven about 40 minutes, or until custard is just set but still trembles slightly (custard will continue to set as it cools). Remove plate from pan and cool custard completely on a rack. Chill creme caramel, loosely covered with plastic wrap, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day. Make crust: In a large bowl with fingertips or a pastry blender blend together flour, brown sugar, salt, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1 tablespoon ice water and toss mixture with a fork until incorporated. Add some or all of remaining ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork to incorporate until mixture just begins to form a dough. On a work surface with heel of hand smear dough in 3 or 4 forward motions to help distribute butter. Form dough into a ball and flatten to form a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into a 10-inch round continued in part 2</li>

If desired, garnish the dip with avocado slices. Serve with Oven-Crisp Tortilla Chips or other tortilla chips. Makes about 2 3/4 cups dip. Oven-Crisp Tortilla Chips: Here's an easy way to make your own tortilla chips without frying them. Cut flour tortillas into wedges with kitchen shears or a knife. Place the wedges on an ungreased baking sheet and toast in a 350F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or till dry and crisp. You'll find they're sturdy for dipping, there's no messy cleanup, and the chips are lower in calories than those you buy in the store. from Better Homes and Gardens "Super Snacks" "Super-Cool Nibbles" posted by Tiffany Hall-Graham Recipe By : File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

      <li>I just recently joined the Women's Club, and I purchased their cookbooks that they had for sale. I thought it was a great find, because it gave some history about the Cocoa Beach area. The cookbooks theme is all about space, and the contributors are all related to working at KSC, NASA, or any other company having to do with helping put our people into space. I ran across several recipes that I thought were interesting or were interesting contributors (by virtue of who they were). If anyone is interested in a set of these books, please email me privately. I just love old cookbooks, and I am always rumaging (sp) through swap meets and garage sales for some. Mrs. Richard m. Nixon, wife of the President Mash 2 medium sized avocados. Stir into slightly thickened lemon gelatin base, made with gelatin, lemon juice and hot water. Stir in grapefruit sections and chopped celery. Chill and unmold. Serve with a whipped cream and mayonnaise mixture. (Fresh grapefruit must be thoroughly drained or may be difficult to gel) EAT-L DIGEST 9 JUNE 1996 From the EAT-L recipe list.

    <title>Avocado-Tomatillo Sauce</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Ripe avocados; peeled, pitted and chopped</li>
      <li>4 Medium-to-large tomatillos*; chopped</li>
      <li>2 Or more habaneros; minced, (seeded or not as you prefer)</li>
      <li>1 Onion; minced</li>
      <li>As many garlic cloves as you want; minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Lime juice; or to taste</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Since there seems to be something of a "green recipe" thread running through the list at the moment, I thought I'd submit a favorite of mine. This derives from the "Habanero Cookbook," by Dave DeWitt and Nancy Gerlach, where it was introduced as a sauce for fish. * If using fresh tomatillos, husk them, then boil about 10 min. or until soft in unsalted water. Let cool and chop. If using canned tomatillos, they can be chopped and added directly to the mix. I prefer the slightly sharper taste of fresh ones if you can get them... Combine avocados, chopped tomatillos, habaneros and garlic in a food processor and mix well. Add lime juice and blend until desired consistency is reached. Add salt, taste and adjust if necessary. Depending on the ripeness of the avocados, the juiciness of the tomatillos, and the amount of lime juice added, this sauce can vary from chunky and pale green to quite runny and dark green. It's very good on top of hearty fish like swordfish or tuna, and it's great with chicken, but I've also made it alone as a dip for parties. Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by "Jonathan T.

When the meat is cooked, put in a big dish, (I use two, If you have no covers, cover with plastic wrap) Add the sauce and mix well to cover every piece of rib. Cover. Let marinate 8 to 24 hours. (I know it's long but...) They can be cooked on the BBQ. but I'm sure also in the oven. BBQ cooking time is 25-30 min. I don't know where you are in Canada, but I'm in Quebec and (not to get any jealous reactions) but our BBQ is closed in, there is a window I can open, we BBQ all year round.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound String Beans</li>
      <li>1 large Fat Clove of Garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sunflower oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Take a handful of beans, lay them flat and cut of the ends. Do the same with the other end, then the rest of the beans. Wash them. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, preferably one in which you can lay all the beans in one layer, and put in the beans and finely chopped garlic. Turn for two or three minutes until well coated in garlic and oil. Pour in just enough water to cover and turn the heat up to maximum. The water will boil away as the beans cook - it will take no more than seven or eight minutes. Once the beans started to sizzle as the water boils away, sprinkle them generously with salt and black pepper. When the water has completely evaporated the beans are ready.

Do not stir during this time. Add the salt and epazote, if you are using it, and simmer for another 30 minutes. Set aside, preferably until the next day. There should be plenty of soupy liquid.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 pounds Bulk pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 cup Instant minced onion</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Sweet pepper flakes</li>
      <li>108 ounces Kidney beans; (No. 10 can)*</li>
      <li>105 ounces Tomatoes; (No. 10 can)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chili powder</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Flour; unsifted</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* A No. 10 can is the equivalent of 7 (16-oz) cans of kidney beans or 4 (28-oz) cans. Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served without freezing. Crumble sausage; brown with onion and pepper flakes. Drain off fat. Add beans, tomatoes, salt, chili powder, and garlic powder. Mix flour and water until smooth. Stir into sausage mixture. Simmer about 30 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING: Serve hot mixture over cooked rice. TO FREEZE: Pour each part to be frozen into a baking pan. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets. Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about 4 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans. TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD: Preheat oven to 400ø F. (hot). Remove freezer wrap. Place food in baking pan. Heat 1 1/2 hours or until mixture is bubbly at edges and center is hot. Serve over cooked rice. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #184 Date: Mon, 05 Aug 1996 11:22:06 -0500 From: "R.

    <title>Beans with Chicos and Pork</title>
    <category>Vegetable</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 ounces Chicos</li>
      <li>2 cups Dried pinto beans</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large Yellow onion; peeled, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic; chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 Red chile pod; seeded, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Lean pork; cubed into 1/4" pieces</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Chicos are a wonderful and very rich cornproduct. They consist of a rich sweet corn that is sun- or kiln-dried and then removed from the cob. They are a basic treat in the diet of the Southwest Indians, and I have come to just love the stuff. The use of corn and beans together should certainly tell you that this dish is legitimate. Remember the East Coast Indians made a similar dish called Misacquetash or succotash. This dish is much better. You will find chicos in any Mexican or Latin American market. They come in little 6-ounce bags and appear to be expensive, but you must remember that they swell up more than rice. They are rich in flavor and great in food value. If you cannot find them in your area it is worth sending away for them. Soak the chicos and beans together in ample water overnight. Put the oil in a medium-hot frying pan and saute the onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes until the onion is transparent. Remove from the pan and place in a 2-quart covered saucepan. Saute the pork in the same frying pan just until the meat begins to brown. Drain the chicos and beans and all of the ingredients to the saucepan and then add enough water to just barely cover. Add salt to taste and simmer, covered, until the beans and chicos are tender, about l hour. This is a very rich dish. It can be served as a side dish or as a main course. Add a vegetable dish and you have a complete meal. NOTE: Bacon can be substituted for the pork and the dish is very good that way. Use about 6 thick slices.

Allow grain to sit for the time specified. Curtis Jackson, cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com I've just discovered, thanks to an old cookbook, a faster way to cook beans, with very good results. The method is to drop the beans into boiling water sufficiently slowly that the water never stops boiling. The rational, according to the cookbook, is that the sudden heat ruptures the bean's hull. Hot water can then easily penetrate and cook the bean. No pre-soaking is required. The cookbook also suggests that after getting all the beans in the water, the heat should be turned down to as slow a simmer as possible, because excessive heat causes the proteins in the beans to get tough. Also, no salt should be added until the beans are cooked, as salt hinders the water from penetrating the bean. I've tried this with red kidney beans and lima beans, and it worked very well. They both cooked to perfectly done tenderness in 1 hour, with no pre-soaking.I haven't tried it with harder to cook beans, like soybeans.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Soak the beans in a generous quantity of water overnight. The following morning, drain, put them in a pot with 2 qts. of lightly salted cold water, and let cook for 1 1/2 hours. Clean, wash and slice the cabbage, carrots, onion and the leeks. Make a battuto with celery, basil and parsley. Thinly slice the pancetta. Put a pot on the stove with the oil, adding everything you have cut and minced (except the cabbage). Saute over a low flame until the vegetables begin to get tender. Then add the cabbage and continue to cook over a low flame so that the vegetables can stew well. Add the tomatoes (peeled and chopped), a pinch of thyme and a pinch of pepper, and continue to cook over a low heat, stirring frequently. Pass about half the beans in a food sieve and add the resulting puree to the vegetables. Add this to the beans and their broth, stir well and let cook for one more hour. Offer extra virgin olive oil on the side. TIP: Always add more broth if soup gets too thick. &gt;"Fagioli con cavolo nero alla toscana," recipe from Italian food and med diet - southern europe, Sicily. (slow page) http://www.osolemio.it/meddiet/default.nclk 1998: O-solemio is an e-zine about Italy. Notes: Italian cabbages: Savoy Cabbage and Head Cabbage (Verza e cavolo cappuccio): These belong to the same family as broccoli and cauliflower and are primarily a winter vegetable. Savoy cabbages have compact heads of wrinkled, curry leaves, dark green on the outside and lighter in the inside. Head cabbages also have compact heads, but with smooth, light green leaves; they are more delicate in taste than the Savoy. The leaves of the head cabbage can also be russet or violet in color (known in Italy as cavolonero, Tuscan cabbage or black cabbage). Both of them may be eaten raw, cut in thin strips and seasoned with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, or may be stewed or cooked in savory pies and soups. Substitute savoy cabbage. If you want the color, try raddichio or red cabbage. &gt;Edited by Pat Hanneman 98-Mar Recipe by: The Basics of Italian Cuisine: Med-diet Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by KitPATh &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; on Mar 23, 1998</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Yesterday I cooked "B.B. with R." and I thought I should share this recipe with you. This recipe is world famous, at least in Suriname and in the Netherlands. As the Dutch people don't know how to cook it, at least they know the song with the title: B.B. with R. B.B. is "brown beans" (baked beans?) and the R. is for rice. As children, brought up in Holland by a Dutch mother and a Suramese father, we were allowed to choose the food for the christmas dinner. Every year the three of us choose B.B. with R.! My mother cooked it without complaining. This is one of the things I admire her for. She learned this recipe from her mother-in-law, who spent before World War II a year in Holland. My son also always choose this recipe when he was allowed tot choose the meal. And he grow up in a time that french frites were already very popular in Holland. The recipe originates from the African-Surinamese kitchen, but is now eaten by all the members of the Surinamese society. At big party's b.b. with r. is often served (but then with salted b**f and ch***n). At a party there is always food for everyone - even when everyone means 200 or more.) We have in this country a lot of reasons to give a party... 1. Simmer onions a few minutes. 2. Add tomatoes and cube of bouillon. Simmer till thickened a bit (about five minutes) 3. Make the broth tasty with black pepper 4. Add the brown beans, the selley leaves and the whole hot pepper. Add enough cooking water. 5. Simmer till the liquid is thickened (about another ten minutes). 6. Make tot taste with the nutmeg (and more pepper). 7. Serve the rice covered with the beans, the finely cut hot pepper (with fork and knife!) and a cucumber salad and sing the song b.b. with r.!

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>THIS IS A LEFT-OVER RECIPE FOR USE WITH THE AROMATIC CANNELLINI BEANS MASTER RECIPE. Remove the steak and beans from the refrigerator to take off a bit of the chill. Meanwhile, prepare a pesto by placing the basil, parsley, garlic and Parmesan in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until finely chopped, then scrape down the sides of the bowl. With the motor running, pour in the olive oil, then the water, in a thin stream. Mix the beans with half the pesto, season with salt. Set beans and remaining pesto aside. Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill, turning once, until just rare in the center, about 12 minutes total. remove from the grill and lst stand for 5 minutes, then cut across the grain into very thin slices. Divide the beans among dinner plates. Top with 2-3 slices of grilled steak and drizzle with some of the remaining pesto. This may serve 6 in your family -- it only serves 4 in mine.

Cook on low until beans are soft (about 18 hours? I forget). When beans are cooked, ladle off and reserve some of the liquid from the top. Mash the beans well.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Cook beans until tender. That's about 20 minutes in the pressure cooker (what a marvel of technology!). Obviously, a lot longer if you don't have one. You could use canned beans too, if you wanted to be quick about it. Add potatoes and celery and cook until potatoes are tender. In the pressure cooker that takes anywhere from 2-8 minutes, depending how finely you chop the potatoes. I cut mine into large cubes and it took about 4 minutes (but I live at 5500, so adjust accordingly). Salt to taste. Saute onion until browned. Mix in with beans and potatoes. If you like it hot, a shot or two of hot sauce would be good. Extremely filling!!!! From: Sharon.E.Badian@att.com.

    <category>Main dish.</category>
    <quantity>10</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>10 large (10") tortillas or chapatis</li>
      <li>1 cup Dried pinto beans, soaked</li>
      <li>Overnight in 3 cups water</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups TVP granules or flakes</li>
      <li>1/2 cups (less 1 T.) hot water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Oregano</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Onion, chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Drain, rinse and cook the beans until tender (70-90 minutes) in 3 cups of water with the bay leaf and garlic. Drain the beans, but reserve the liquid in case it is needed later to thin the filling mixture. Combine the TVP, hot water, hot bean liquid, chili powder, cumin, salt and oregano. Saute the onion in the olive oil in a good sized skilled until softened. Add the seasoned TVP and cook a few minutes more. Stir in the cooked beans, then transfer mixture to a food processor or blender and mash to a fairly smooth textured filling, adding a little of the bean liquid if mixture is too thick. Taste and add a little hot sauce if desired. If done in a blender, you may need to do it in two batches, then mix the batches together. To assemble: heat a griddle or skillet until a few drops of water dance on the surface. Dry fry each tortilla on both sides until the surface of the tortilla begins to bubble and brown slightly. Keep them warm in a thick towel. When all are heated, place about 1/3 cup of filling down one side of a tortilla and roll up. You may wish to enclose or serve with side dishes of shredded lettuce, grated soy cheese, salsa sauce or sliced avocados. Serve immediately. To reheat: Burritos may be made ahead, kept wrapped, and baked before serving. Unwrap, place on cookie sheet, bursh tops lightly with oil if desired and bake at 350 degrees about 20 minutes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Butter an 8 inch square pan. Line with waxed paper and butter the paper. Whirl the tepary beans in a food processor until smooth. In a large bowl, mix the processed beans with rest of the ingredients. Spread in prepared baking dish. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool, before removing from the pan. Peel off waxed paper and cut into squares. Makes 16 2 inch squares. NOTE: A rich, moist brownie, so terrific you'll probably want to make a double batch. No one will guess their secret goodness is tepary beans. Carob powder is made from pods of the Carob tree, processed to resemble cocoa powder. However Carob contains more nutrients and is caffeine free. It is sold in Health Food Stores. Source: Boutique Bean Pot From The Cookie Lady's Files Reformatted for MM:dianeE 6/23/93</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>occasionally for the first hour or so; covered. Then remove cover and turn down to low and stir occasionally. This is a slow process since you have NOT precooked the apples. Will take 36 or MORE hours. You may have to use MORE or LESS of the juices depending on the tartness (or sweetness) of the fruit. You can cook during the night but I usually do not. I usually put the entire inset in the fridge. CANNING: You can process this in a water bath but I usually just keep it in the fridge; it never lasts that long. NOTE: It is the evaporation of the liquid that thickens and sweetens this 'butter'. After initial cooking with lid; REMOVE lid of the crockpot during the cooking and keep it on LOW! Stir to break up the skin. You may have to use a hand held blender to get it smooth..or ZAP in the Food Processor. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #190 Date: 07/03/96 From: eboyd@shentel.net</li>

Bring mixture to a full rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Quickly stir sugar into juices and bring the mixture back to a full rolling boil--boil for 1 minute while stirring constantly. Mixture will rise to within 2 inches of the top of the pan so make sure you stir continuosly. Remove from the heat and skim off foam with a spoon. Fill jars to 1/8th inch from top. Wipe jar rims then cover with flat lids. Screw lids on tightly. Use a water bath to finish sealing. Recipe (from Bonnie Trigg of Oceanside) was a prize winner at the 1994 Del Mar, Ca county fair.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel and core apples and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Dice fennel. Toast and peel hazelnuts. Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces. Combine apples, fennel, lemon juice, honey, cider, sambuca, nutmeg, allspice and salt in a bowl; toss gently to combine. Cover and set aside. Topping: Combine sugar, nuts, flour and salt in a processor. Pulse until nuts are finely ground. Add shortening and butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing briefly after each addition. Continue adding water until mixture holds together when pinched between your fingers. Do not overmix or the dough will be tough. Pat into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spoon the apple mixture into a 9 x 13-inch glass baking dish. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 9 x 13-inch rectangle; gently lay the dough over the fruit, tucking in the edges. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and, using a spoon or spatula, break crust into 3- or 4-inch irregular squares. Press pieces into the apples, "dowdying" the appearance of the dish. Return to oven and bake for 20 minutes, until well browned. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.

Place apples in casserole dish and sprinkle with orange juice. Mix together the sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and butter until crumbly. Do not over process. Sprinkle this topping mixture over the apples. Bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until apples are tender.

      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Flour</li>
      <li>150 mililiters Milk; 5/8 cup</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: MarkandSue@highland.cix.co.uk (Mark and Sue Thomas) These are a bit like Danish Pastries but without the yeast dough. You can use either filling or both together. Cut pastry into 16 squares, 3" by 3". On each square, cut in diagonally from each corner, leaving an area in the centre that is uncut, about 1 inch across. Put a teaspoonful of either or both fillings in the centre. Take one corner and fold it to the middle. Move to the next triangle, and fold in one corner. Do this for each of the 4 triangles, so you have a pinwheel shape. Four corners meet in the middle on top of the apple, and 4 are left flat. This is easier to do than to explain! Use a fish slice to lift onto a greased or lined tray, and paint with milk or egg and milk if you have any. Bake at 190 C, 375 F for 20 minutes until the points are golden brown. To make custard: Mix all together and either microwave for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, or cook over a low heat in a saucepan until thickened. It will taste a bit raw at this stage, but will be fine after baking. Recipe by: Sue Thomas Posted to recipelu-digest by jeryder@juno.com on Mar 17, 1998</li>

Into a bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Add butter and shortening and blend with your fingertips or pastry blender until it resembles coarse meal. Add 1 cup of the cream, stirring until dough forms a ball. Be careful not to overwork dough. On a lightly floured surface, turn out dough and pat into a 1/2-inch thick round. Use a 2 to 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter to stamp out rounds. Gather scraps into a round and stamp out more rounds. Arrange rounds, lightly touching one another, on top of apple filling so they form one continuous layer. Brush tops with remaining 2 tablespoons heavy cream and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar to taste. Bake cobbler in middle of oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until filling is bubbling and dough is pale golden.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Floury potatoes</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 ounces Butter</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Self-raising flour</li>
      <li>2 Apples, peeled,cored,chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Softened butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The potatoes must be hot and floury, but either eating apples or cooking apples can be used. (Best results with a cooking apple, though.) -- Boil the peeled potatoes in well-salted water. Drain and cover with a cloth to "dry in their steam". Sieve or rice into a warmed mixing bowl, and beat in the fat. Work in sufficient flour to make the dough manageable, adding salt to taste. Divide the dough in half and roll or pat into 2 rounds of equal size just over 1/2 inch thick. Place one round on the warmed bakestone and spread with the chopped apple. Cover with the other round of dough and pinch the edges together. -- Bake on the bakestone over a moderate heat until brown underneath. Turn using the broadest spatula you have, or two spatulas and a friend. Cook the other side. Remove the cake to a hot serving dish. Carefully peel up one side of the top of the cake, spread the apples with the softened butter, and sprinkle them with sugar. Fold that half down and do the same to the other side. Sprinkle sugar on top, and serve immediately, with thick cool cream. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Dry white wine</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 large Green onions; chopped about 1/4 cup</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons ;salt</li>

      <li>1 cup Apple juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Parsley; chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place brisket, the yellow onion, chopped garlic and garlic cloves in a large Dutch oven. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours or until the brisket is tender. Drain brisket. (If you wish, you could keep the brisket covered with the cooking liquid and refrigerate it overnight. This will help prepare for the next day.) In a small saucepan, mix together the apple jelly, wine, mustard, green onions, salt, pepper, and curry powder. Heat until the jelly melts. Place brisket in a shallow roasting pan and brush some of the jelly mixture over the top. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 45 minutes, basting 3 or 4 times with the remaining jelly mixture. Remove the meat to a platter to keep warm. Place the pan over 2 burners and add apple juice, stirring to scrape up browned bits on bottom of pan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil, stirring, until slightly thickened and reduced by about half. Pour into a gravy boat. Slice meat and garnish with the parsley. Serve with gravy.

    <ingredient>
      <li>8 tablespoons Unsalted butter; softened</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 Large egg</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Sifted all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Baking soda FILLING:</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Apple butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>Grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>Confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the dough: In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat until light in color and texture, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Sift the flour with the salt and baking soda. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition. Scrape the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap tightly. Refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to roll out, at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight. To make the filling: Combine the apple butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and walnuts and mix well. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Divide the dough into 4 portions. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out one portion of dough to 1/8 inch thickness. (If the dough crumbles, work in your hands until malleable.) Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out rounds of the dough. Gather up the scraps to work into the remaining dough. Repeat the process until all the dough has been used. Place a rounded teaspoon of the filling in the center of half of the rounds. Brush the edges of the rounds lightly with water. Place the remaining rounds on top of the filled cookies. Using a fork, press the edges sealed. Don't worry if cracks appear in the surface. Transfer the cookies to ungreased baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving. Makes about 20 large cookies.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Sometime last week someone (can't remember who, and I already deleted it....) requested a recipe for some kind of stuffed potato. I'm not sure if this is what he had in mind, but it's one of our family favorites. It is the recipe that was used in the restaurant of the Appleton Inns in Massachusetts when my father managed them about ten years ago. Bake the potatoes at 400 degrees for 40 minutes or until tender (I sometimes "nuke 'em"). Cut the top quarter off of the potatoes and discard (or do what you will with them!). Scrape the potato out of the skin and place in a large bowl. Place the skins on a baking sheet. Sliver the bacon and add to the potato in the bowl. Add the remaining ingredients into the bowl and mix to the desired texture. Spoon the mixture back into the potato skins, piling high. Bake at 400 degrees for another 10-15 minutes, until light brown. Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 Sep 96 From: Melisa Wells &lt;MelisaLW@AOL.COM&gt; Date: Wed, 11 Sep 1996 08:45:04 -0400</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cube bread and toss in a large bowl with raisins and caraway seeds. Stale bread may be used instead of fresh. Toss apples in a bolw with bread cubes. Combine apple and sunflower butter (or tahini), 1 cup water, miso, amazake or soy milk, then pour liquid mixture over apples and bread. Stir to coat. Spoon mixture into a lightly oiled 2-quart casserole dish or two 9-inch pie plates or cake pans. Cover with lid (oven-proof). Allow mixture to sit for 2 to 4 hours before baking so bread will soak up flavors. Bake covered at 350F for 1 hour or until slightly firm and mixture pulls away from sides slightly. Then remove from oven and spoon into individual dessert cups. An ice cream scooper works well. Allow to cool slightly and then serve.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 kilogram Apples (2 1/4 lb) You NEED an apple that will hold its shape during cooking !!</li>
      <li>5 deciliters Red wine ( 1 pint)</li>
      <li>1 Stick cinnamon</li>
      <li>250 grams Sugar (9 oz)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Ten hours in advance, cook the wine, cinnamon and sugar over a brisk heat for 10 minutes, using a broad, shallow saucepan. Peel the apples and, using a melon-baller of about 2.5 cm (1 in) diameter, cut them into little balls. Throw the apple-balls into the hot wine. They should not overlap: this is why you need a broad, shallow pan. Simmer them for 5 to 7 minutes, covered with aluminium foil to keep them submerged. When the apples are cooked but still firm, remove the pan from the stove. Let the apple-balls macerate in the red wine for about 10 hours to take on a good red colour. Serving: well chilled, with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, or in a selection of cold fruit desserts.

      <li>Recipe by: Nicki Fritz &lt;FRITZ@QHORSE.STX.COM&gt; I tried (with a few minor modifications) the Apple Pie muffins Marg posted, and they were wonderful! They are the first muffins that actually have the consistency of regular, non-lf muffins. I did use the cake flour as Marg suggested, but I had tried that in other muffin recipes, and still got that very rubbery consistency that lf-sweet things tend to have. [nf] Mix wet ingredients, and add dry. Stir until everything is moistened (these make a very wet batter). Spray a muffin pan with Pam, and fill the muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake at 400 for 15-17 minutes, until a tootpick comes out dry. This was half of the original recipe, and made 9 average muffins. If I had a bigger pan, it probably would have made 6 nice-sized muffins. Each has less than 1 gram of fat per muffin.

      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>1 Sliver of lemon peel</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract or cognac vanilla *</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* To make cognac vanilla, get a fresh, fresh vanilla bean, cut lengthwise and then crosswise exposing the tiny tiny seeds. Put into an airtight container and pour on 2.5 oz. cognac or brandy per bean. Every 2 or 3 days, shake the bottle. After about 2 or 3 weeks, you'll have a new taste sensation in vanilla flavoring. Preheat oven to 375 F Melt 3 T of the butter in a heavy saucepan. Add flour and blend in well until smooth. Slowly add the milk, stirring constantly with a whisk, over medium heat; cook until the mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 C sugar and beat hard. Add the egg yolks, blending them in well. Remove the pan from the heat and add the vanilla, the Calvados or brandy. Set aside, but keep it warm. Melt the reaming butter in a skillet. Add the apples, sprinkled with the remaining sugar and gently sauté until tender, about 7 or 8 minutes.Beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold stiff peaks. Fold a small amount into the egg yolk mixture just to lighten it up a little, then fold in the rest of the whites. Place half the apples in a buttered shallow 1.5 quart baking dish. Cover the apples with half the egg mixture. Add the remaining apples and sprinkle with the macaroon crumbs. Cover the apples and macaroon with the remaining egg mixture, filing the dish almost to the rim.Bake until the top is golden brown and the pudding is fairly firm, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve at once with Vanilla Sauce. Vanilla Sauce: Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan and mix well. Add the salt, lemon peel and water. Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until the sauce is clear, 5 to 7 minutes. Discard the lemon peel and add the butter. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla. If you want it creamier, add 1 or 2 T heavy whipping cream.

Slice in the peeled and cored apples. Sprinkle in the last ounce of sugar. Make a circle for a lid with the last of the pastry.

      <li>From: tamale@aloha.net Date: Wed, 03 Jul 1996 18:52:48 -1000 Around 1977, I was fortunate to take a class at the Los Feliz Jewish Community Center (Los Angeles) with Judy Zeidler, before she became the author of several great books on Jewish cooking. She was then a columnist with the Los Angeles Times. She proved how much she enjoyed cooks and cooking -- her sense of fun was so infectious, and we all laughed so hard, that I came home covered with flour, tahine, and apricot-pineapple preserves! I now serve her tasty Apple &amp; Spinach Salad to my family: In a large bowl: Toss apples, onions and celery. Sprinkle with juice of one lemon to keep apples from darkening. In a blender or small bowl: Blend mayonnaise, tahini, honey and remaining lemon juice (misture will be thick). Toss with apple mixture. Cover and chill. Just before serving, toss salad with spinach. Serve on a bed of spinach leaves and garnish with sesame seeds. Serves 4 to 6. Submitted by: Claudia Parras tamale@aloha.net JEWISH-FOOD digest 229 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

    <title>Apples in Maple Syrup</title>
    <category>Dessert</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Apples; halved &amp; cored</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter; melted</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Such a special treat. Apple seeds were brought from England, but the wonderful flavor of maple syrup was here waiting for those apples. This is the legitimate ancestor of the more common baked apple. Place the apples in a tightly fitting baking dish, cut side up. Mix the remaining ingredients and pour over the apples. Bake at 350ø, uncovered, for 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until the apples are soft and the syrup has reduced and is fairly thick. Baste 3 or 4 times during the baking process.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 small Head of fresh celery</li>
      <li>2 large Cooking apples</li>
      <li>1 ounce Butter</li>
      <li>60 fluid ounces Stock</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions, peeled and diced</li>
      <li>Salt and milled pepper</li>
      <li>Milk to finish</li>
      <li>Chopped parsley and browned flaked almonds to garnish</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Soft brown sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large saucepan sweat off the diced onion in the butter. Wash, trim and dice the celery, add to the onion and continue on a low heat. Remove and bruises from the apples and grate them into your pan, discarding the core. Cook for a further 10 minutes before adding the stock, seasoning and sugar ~ beware too much salt if you are using a stock cube. Bring to the boil, then simmer, lid on, for 30 minutes - don't over cook or the celery flavour becomes jaded and the colours dull. Allow to cool a little before liquidising thoroughly. Pass through a large mesh sieve to ensure there are no stringy threads of celery remaining. Check seasoning and consistency, adding a little milk if needed. Serve in warmed bowls, sprinkled with parsley and the browned almond flakes. Source: Lakeland Plastics From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1 package Active Dry Yeast</li>

      <li>2 large Eggs</li>

      <li>Other</li>
      <li>Peeled, halved, cored --</li>
      <li>Sliced thin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon, ground</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Heavy Cream</li>
      <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the Milk, Butter and Salt in a heavy saucepan and Scald. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm, making sure the butter melts. (Should not exceed 115@F. Dissolve the Pinch of Sugar in 1/4 C. warm Water. Sprinkle in Yeast. Proof 5 minutes in warm oven*. Add the proofed Yeast Mixture to a large mixing bowl (or Mixer Bowl). Add the remaining Sugar and the cooled Milk Mixture (watch the Temp!). Add 1 C. Flour and mix well on low-speed to incorporate. Add the Eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Add another C. Flour and mix vigorously (about 3 minute on High, or 5+ minutes by hand). The dough will be elastic but still a little sticky. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead in the remaining Flour. (May use Dough Hook on this one.) Add enough Flour to the dough no longer sticks to your fingers when touched, but STILL is very soft. Remove to clean bowl, cover, and rise (at about 70@F. or so) until doubled, about 1 hour. (May cover with Plastic Wrap and refrigerate till the next morning). Preheat oven. Butter an 8" x 11" Pyrex with 1 T. melted Butter. Sprinkle the bottom with HALF of the Brown Sugar. Prepare the Apple and arrange the slices over the Sugar, covering the bottom of the Pyrex completely. (If the dough was refrigerated, remove 1/2 hour ahead of time to warm.) Punch down the dough and roll out to 9" x 16". Brush with the remaining 1 T. melted Butter. Sprinkle the remaining Brown Sugar over the butter to the very edges, then the Cinnamon, then the Raisins. Tightly roll up Jelly-Roll Fashion from a Long Side. With Seam-Side Down, cut into 16-1" thick slices and distribute evenly in the Pyrex. There will be room to rise. Cover with a towel and let rise until they've filled the pan, about 20 minutes. Baste the Cream over the rolls with a Pastry Brush and bake as above until golden. Remove to a rack and cool 5 minutes. Invert onto a platter and serve. (Or just scoop out of the pan.) * Turn on oven to 200@F for 5 minutes and turn off. Measure Water (watch the Temp!) into 1 C. Pyrex. Add the Pinch Sugar. Add Yeast on top of water and place on top rack for 5 minutes. Remove. It should be foamy. If so, it's ready to use. If not, your yeast is bad.

      <li>From: jkirsch@intercable.net (Jacobo Kirsch) Date: Mon, 5 Aug 1996 13:34:40 -0600 My grandmother used to make this incredible Apple Kugl for Rosh Hashana. She is 91 years old, and this year she is very sick, so for the first time since I was born, she won't be able to cook for us in the Holidays. She taught me how to bake this kugl, I hope everybody enjoys it the way our family did for many, many years. I 'd like to share it with all of you as a tribute to such a great woman, who came to Mexico a few days before all her family was murdered in Lithuania. Mix the ingredients and form a soft dough. (if you use a Food Procesor, mix the dry ingredients first, and then slowly add the liquids). Finish the dough kneadding it with your hands for a few minutes. Extend the dough with the rolling pin in a big circular shape (aprox. 18 in diameter). Spread the circle with plum preserve (maybe 1 or 1 1/2 jars). until it is very well covered. Peel 4 apples and slice them (not very thin, you may use 2 or 3 more apples depending on their size). Put the apples over the preserves, sprinkle with sugar, cinamon and a little bit of pepper. Roll the strudl very carefully, making a tight roll. Seal the edges with water. Have ready a deep ovenproof large pot, with boiling oil. (about 2/3 cup). Very carefully place the kugl in the oil rolling it (to make it fit in the pot). Cover the kugl with boiling water. (yes, water, it won't mess up the dough). Then cover the pot with foil, and put it in the oven for 2 hours at 400 degrees. Uncover the pot and let it brown a little. Serving: Unmold the kugl, and slice it like a cake. Don't worry the slices won't come out perfect, but the flavor will. It sounds difficult, but it's not, and it's worthwhile. I hope everybody tries before Rosh Hashana so you'll be a pro for the Holydays. JEWISH-FOOD digest 302 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

Combine dates, raisins and cinnamon basil and fill center of apple with mixture. Arrange apples in a baking dish just large enough to hold them. with a vegetable peeler, carefully remove the orange part of the orange peel. Cut peel into very fine strips. Squeeze orange juice; pour around apples, using enough to make about 1/2-inch of juice in the dish. Drop cut strips of orange peel into juices. Bake, basting with juices every 10 or 15 minutes, for 50 minutes or until apples are tender when pierced with a knife. Sprinkle with a little sugar and broil with surface of fruit four inches below of heat Baste with remaining syrup until glazed. Best made ahead of time; serve at room temperature.

      <li>Apples give a distinctive twist to this traditional Greek dessert. Sauteing them first to let the water evaporate ensures a crisp crust. Prep time: 1 hour plus cooling Baking time: 35 to 40 minutes Apple Layer: Peel and slice apples. Melt butter in Dutch oven over high heat. Add apples, sugar and cinnamon; cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender and juices are evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool. Nut Mixture: Combine all ingredients in small bowl. Preheat oven to 400^F. Trim phyllo sheets to 13x9-inch rectangles; cover with plastic wrap. Brush 13x9-inch metal baking pan with butter. Place 1 phyllo sheet in pan and brush with some of the melted butter (keep remaining phyllo covered). Layer 5 more phyllo sheets on top, brushing each with butter. Spread 2 cups nut mixture on top and repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and butter. Spread apple mixture on top; repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and butter. Sprinkle remaining nut mixture on top; sprinkle with bread crumbs and layer with the 6 remaining phyllo sheets and butter. With sharp knife, cut lengthwise through pastry and filling into 1 1/2 inch-wide strips, then cut diagonally at 2-inch intervals to make diamonds. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden. Drizzle honey on top and bake 5 minutes more. Cool in pan on wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with whipped or ice cream. Makes 12 servings.

      <li>1/3 cups Sour cream</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Use only the tender inner stalks of celery for this recipe. ** Note: See the "A Basic Chicken Stock" recipe which is included in this collection. Poach the chicken breasts in the poaching liquid for 10 minutes, or just until the pink color is gone throughout. The breasts will be firm when pressed with the back of a fork. Let cool to room temperature in the liquid. Remove and discard the skin and bones, and shred the chicken into bite-size pieces. Core, peel, and cut apples in 1/2" slices. In a large bowl, toss the apples with 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Add the chicken, dates, and celery. Toss to mix well. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, mayonnaise, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Add to the chicken mixture, along with salt and pepper. Toss again to combine well. Cover and chill the salad for 1 hour or more. Just before serving, stir in the walnuts. This recipe serves 4 to 6. Comments: Serve this classic fruit and chicken salad on a bed of red and white cabbage. In addition this, there are several other fruit and chicken breast combinations you might want to fix. See the variations "Red And Green Grapes Chicken Salad" and "Mango Chicken Salad" (recipes included in this collection) for inspiration -- each one is as easy as this recipe.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Dried apricot halves, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup Golden raisins</li>
      <li>Juice and grated rind of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>1 cup Orange juice</li>
      <li>2 cups Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I received a great little book for Christmas called "From My House To Yours" that has gift recipes, ideas and lots of little tid-bits. The following recipe is from that book. I'll include the notes the author wrote and will follow this message with the recipe for English Muffin Loaf that he makes note of. Sonya "This is delicious with toasted thin slices of English Muffin Loaf. Dried apricots sold in bulk are usually more flavorful than the prepackaged kind; natural food stores are a good source." 1. Place the apricots and raisins in a bowl and add water to cover. Cover the bowl tightly and let it stand overnight. Drain the liquid into a large, heavy saucepan and chop the apricots coarsely. Add the apricots, raisins, lemon juice and rind, and orange juice to the pan, place over low heat, and bring to a simmer. Cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 2. Add the sugar and continue cooking, stirring frequently until the mixture of fruit is very soft and the syrup sheets when dropped from the side of a spoon (220 degrees on a candy thermometer), 15 to 20 minutes. Spoon the jam into sterilized half-pint jars. Seal the jars, process in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes and cool. Store in a cool, dark place.

      <li>1/2 cups Cranberry juice</li>
      <li>12 ounces Fresh (or thawed frozen) cranberries</li>

      <li>Soak the dried apricots in the cranberry juice in a medium saucepan for ten minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir them well. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until the cranberries have popped and the syrup has thickened slightly - that should take about 5 minutes. Let the sauce cool to room temperature, then refrigerate it (covered) until it's *cold*. It can be stored in the fridgipater for up to a week. Transfer the sauce to a serving dish and serve while it's still cold. The colder the better, so long as it isn't frozen. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1. Melt butter in 13x9x2" baking pan inoven while pre-heating; remove. Combine 1 cup of sugar, chopped nuts and cinnamon in small bowl. Sprinkle evenly oveer melted butter. Arrange apple slices, overlapping slightly. 2. Sift flour, remaining sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Add shortening, milk, eggs and vanilla. Beat at low speed, until combined, then at high speed for 2 minutes. Pour evenly over apples. 3. Bake at 350 F (160 C) for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until top springs back when lightly pressed with fingertip. 4. Cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes. Loosen around edges with a knife. Cover with a large serving tray or cookie sheet. Turn. Lift off pan. This came from an issue of either Family Circle or Woman's Day over 20 years ago. It has never failed and has never failed to please. The original recipe calls for the blanched almonds, but I prefer the taste and texture of walnuts or pecans. I also recommend using Granny Smith apples, and unsalted margarine can be used in place of vegetable shortening.

    <title>Apricot-Glazed Ham</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>20</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Ham (10 - 12 pound)</li>
      <li>Whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 cup Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 cups Apricot jam</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry sherry</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Line baking pan with aluminum foil. Place ham on foil, fat side up, and wrap well with more foil. For "fully cooked" boneless ham, cook 15 to 18 minutes per pound until meat thermometer registers internal temperature of 140 degrees. For boneless ham labeled "cook before eating," cook 17 to 21 minutes pre ound until meat thermometer registers internal temperature of 160 degrees. Remove ham from oven and trim of excess fat. Score ham in diamond pattern and stud with cloves. In smalll bowl, combine mustard, jam and sherry until smooth. Coat ham with glaze and return to oven 1 hour, spooning glaze over ham every 15 minutes. (Figure this 1 hour into total time needed to cook ham.) Notes: I use a bone-in ham -- love to have the bone left over for ham and beans. Just needs a little more time to cook. Also, I usually make a little extra sauce so everyone can pour it over their ham at the table.

      <li>1/2 pints Vanilla Ice Cream; softened</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Apricot Preserves</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups Golden Raisins</li>
      <li>1 cup Pecans; coarsely ground</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To prepare dough: Put butter in a medium saucepan and melt slowly over low heat. Do not let butter brown. Pour warm butter into a large bowl. Add ice cream and stir together until ice cream is melted. Mixture will look lumpy. Add flour and stir together until flour is incorporated and soft dough forms. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Chilled dough should feel firm to touch. To fill each strudel: Remove dough from refrigerator and divide it into 4 pieces. Roll 1 piece of dough between your hands into a small ball. Do this quickly so that dough does not soften. Press dough into a 1" thick disc. Lightly flour rolling surface and roll dough to 12 x 6" rectangle about 1/8" thick. Lift and turn dough several times as you roll it so it doesn't stick to rolling surface. the 12" side of dough should be facing you. Leaving 1/2" edge all around, spread 2 tb of apricot preserves evenly over dough. Sprinkle evenly with 1/3 cup raisins and 1/4 cup pecans. With long side still facing you, roll up strudel. Press edges and seam together to seal tightly. Repeat with 3 remaining pieces of dough. Each strudel strip can be wrapped separately in aluminum foil and frozen at this point for up to 3 months. Position oven rack in bottom third of oven. Preheat oven to 375øF. Unwrap as many strudel strips as you want to bake. Line baking sheet with aluminum foil from frozen strudel. Place strudel, seam side down, on baking sheet. If baking more than one, place strips 2" apart. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, reversing baking sheet front to back after 25 minutes to ensure even browning. Strudel crust should look golden brown. Cool 10 minutes on baking sheet. Transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.

      <li>Combine apricot preserves, orange rind, and orange juice; set aside. Remove giblets from hens; reserve for other uses. Rinse hens with cold water, and pat dry. Close cavities, and secure with wooden picks; truss. Sprinkle with paprika and place on a rack in a lightly greased roasting pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, basting frequently with about 1/2 cup apricot mixture during the last 30 minutes. Saute cashews in butter in a large skillet until cashews are golden. Drain and set aside, reserving butter in skillet. Saute onions in same skillet until tender. Add wild rice, and prepare according to package directions, substituting chicken broth for water and omitting salt. When done, stir the cashews back into the rice. Arrange Cornish hens on serving platter; brush with remaining apricot mixture. Garnish with apricot roses and spinach leaves, if desired, and serve with rice. * To make apricot roses, use a rolling pin to flatten 4 or 5 dried apricots for each rose. Wrap apricots around each other, shaping them to resemble a rose; pinch stem end to make them adhere. Source: Southern Living Magazine.

    <title>Apple Tarte Tatin</title>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 large Firm; sweet apples (such as Winesap, Golden Delicious or Matsu), peeled and halved (6 to 8)</li>
      <li>1 Lemons; halved (1 to 2)</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Unsalted</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Puff pastry</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Apples are most bountiful during the fall, and there's no better way to impress your family or dinner guests than with a freshly baked Apple Tarte Tatin, a simple and elegant dessert created by two sisters from the Loire Valley who earned their living making what the French call "tarte des demoiselles Tatin, or "the tart of two unmarried women named Tatin." This famous French upside-down apple tart is made by covering the bottom of a shallow baking dish with butter and sugar, then a layer of apples and finally a pastry crust. while baking, the sugar and butter turn into a delicious caramel that becomes the topping when the tart is inverted onto a serving plate. Choose firm apples that won't soften while baking, like Northern Spy, Winesap or Granny Smith. You can save time and add richness to the tart by using a store-bought puff pastry, instead of making p‰te brisŽe or p‰te sucrŽe. Whichever pastry you use, make sure to keep it well-chilled. Martha Stewart likes to make this tart in a cast iron skillet because it helps the fruit to caramelize, but any heavy-duty nonstick pan with a heat-proof handle will do. Tarte Tatin can be made in advance and left in the pan; simply rewarm it on the stove over low heat to loosen the caramel, making it easy to remove from the pan. For a change, try making this dessert with peaches or pears, and don't forget to serve it with a dollop of freshly whipped cream, cr�me fra”che or vanilla ice cream. It's a dessert your family and friends will remember forever. 1. Heat oven to 400¡. Core apples using a melon baller to retain the rounded shape of the apples. Rub apples with sliced lemons to prevent browning. Set aside. 2. Over medium heat in a 10-inch cast iron skillet, heat sugar and water. Cook until it turns a rich golden color; swirling occasionally, about 6 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, roll puff pastry in one direction out into a 14-inch circle on a lightly floured surface, about 1/8-inch thick. Brush off any excess flour with a pastry brush. 3. Add butter to skillet. Once melted, add the apples; rounded sides down. Adding as many as possible. Remove from heat and top apples with puff pastry. Fold edges under and crimp slightly. Make 2 to 3 small cuts in the puff pastry to allow the steam to escape. Place in oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375¡ and bake until pastry isgolden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. 4. Remove from oven and Loosen edges with a knife. Carefully place a plate over the skillet and flip, inverting the Tarte Tatin. Serve warm or at room temperature.

      <li>From: Ruth Heiges &lt;heiges@post.tau.ac.il&gt; Date: 26 Oct 1995 13:10:30 -0500 1. Melt butter in 13x9x2" baking pan inoven while pre-heating; remove. Combine 1 cup of sugar, chopped nuts and cinnamon in small bowl. Sprinkle evenly oveer melted butter. Arrange apple slices, overlapping slightly. 2. Sift flour, remaining sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Add shortening, milk, eggs and vanilla. Beat at low speed, until combined, then at high speed for 2 minutes. Pour evenly over apples. 3. Bake at 350 F (160 C) for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until top springs back when lightly pressed with fingertip. 4. Cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes. Loosen around edges with a knife. Cover with a large serving tray or cookie sheet. Turn. Lift off pan. This came from an issue of either Family Circle or Woman's Day over 20 years ago. It has never failed and has never failed to please. The original recipe calls for the blanched almonds, but I prefer the taste and texture of walnuts or pecans. I also recommend using Granny Smith apples, and unsalted margarine can be used in place of vegetable shortening. Butter is best for the topping. The full quantity of sugar is too much for my taste.

      <li>full. Bake in the preheated oven 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours for a 9- or 10- inch tube cake, about 1 hour and 15 minutes for baby loaves, until the cake top(s) aree golden brown (cracking is normal as the steam escapes) and a cake tester inserted in the center shows no visible raw batter. Cool each cake on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a knife blade around the cake sides to loosen, then top with a cardboard cake disk or plate and invert; remove the pan and peel off the paper. Invert again and cool the cake completely, right side up. Once cold, the cakes may be served or stored. If you wish, wrap the cold cakes in plastic wrap, then in foil, and refrigerate them for a week or two for the flavors to mellow, then serve or freeze. Do not wrap this cake with alcohol-soaked cloths for storage. Of course, it is also fine to eat the cake right after baking. Before serving, brush the cake top with Apricot Glaze or Icing Glaze and set a few halved nuts and cut pieces of apricot into the soft glaze. Allow about 30 minutes for the glaze to set. Apricot Glaze: Stir preserves over medium heat in a small saucepan until melted. Stir and cook about 2 minutes longer, bringing preserves to a boil. Cook until thick enough to coat a spoon. Strain preserves through a sieve. Cool slightly and use pastry brush to coat the cake with lukewarm glaze. Chill cake to set the glaze. Firm Apricot Glaze: This recipe is preferred when a glazed cake top must be held several hours before serving. The addition of gelatin keeps the glaze from melting. Stir preserves over medium heat in a small saucepan until melted. Strain preserves through sieve. Remove solids, then return strained preserves to saucepan. Add gelatin and liqueur. Stir over medium heat until gelatin completely dissolves. Bring to a boil for barely 30 seconds, then cool slightly. Apply lukewarm glaze to cake. Chill cake to set glaze. Basic Icing Glaze: Enough for one 9-inch tube cake. Double recipe for 10-inch tube cake. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl, beat well, and check flavor and consistency. Add more cream to thin, more sifted sugar to thicken the glaze. It should drip from a spatula in a sheet when at correct consistency. Recipe is from _A Piece of Cake_ by Susan G. Purdy.

      <li>2 cups All purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Cold butter</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pastry: Combine flour and salt. Cut butter into small pieces and cut into flour. Add water and mix. Turn onto lightly floured board and knead about 10 times. Flatten and roll to a long rectangle. Fold into 1/3 lengthwise and roll out again. Do this four times, using sprinkling of flour to cover sticky spots of butter. If it becomes difficult to roll wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold. The last time you roll it, cut into 3 equal pieces (each piece rolls out to 10" X 10" and makes 4 turnovers). Freeze 2 of the pieces and use the apple filling to make 4 turnovers. Filling: Peel and core apples, slice thinly and mix with sugar and cinnamon. Roll dough into 10" X 10" and cut into four 5" X 5" squares. On a baking sheet, place 1/4 of the mixture on each square and fold over into triangles. Crimp the edges with a fork so they do not leak. With a sharp knife cut a couple of slits into each turnover. Sprinkle sugar over the top. Place in refrigerator while oven heats to 425 C. Bake 15 minutes until lightly browned.</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Chop the apricots roughly. Put them into a large bowl, sprinkling the fine grated zest of the oranges and the cinnamon between layers. Squeeze the juice of the oranges, measure and add enough water to make 3 pints in all. Pour the liquids over the fruit; leave to soak overnight in a cool place. Slide the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan and simmer gently until the fruit is beautifully tender. Check the fruit occasionally as it cooks and crush it down into the pan with a potato masher. It may need 1 1/4 hours to become really soft. Warm the sugar. Add it to the pan together with the juice of the lemons and the almonds. Cook gently until sugar is melted, then fast-boil until the saucer test shows that the preserve will set. Pot, tie down and label the preserve in the usual way. From WWiVNet. Reposted in Home Cooking by Cathy Harned. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Apple Walnut Stuffing</title>
    <category>Side dish</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 cups Bread, cut into 1" cubes</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Diced onion</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh parsley</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup Chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Pepper</li>
      <li>2 Peeled cored &amp; diced apples</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped walnuts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Place bread cubes in a large bowl. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Chop the parsley. Add celery, onion and parsley to the butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened. This should take about five minutes. Mix all this with the bread. Now beat the eggs. Mix eggs, broth and pepper; add this to the bread and mix it all real well. Stir in apples and walnuts. Bake in greased 2-quart dish for 25 minutes. If you like your stuffing a little crispy, go ahead and cook it for a little longer. When it's done, serve it up! This one'll go quick, and if your kin likes stuffing as much as mine, you may want to double all the ingredients to make a little extra for the day after!

      <li>CREPE BATTER Melt butter over moderate heat. Continue to heat until butter is a light brown color Add milk and warm slightly. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Beat in remaining ingredients until smooth. Refrigerate for an hour or more. (This will make a more tender crepe.) Batter should be only slightly thicker than heavy cream; add milk to thin if necessary. Cook crepes, stacking with plastic wrap or parchment in between to prevent sticking. Refrigerate until ready to use. APRICOT FILLING Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer for about a half hour, or until apricots are soft. Puree mixture in food processor until almost smooth (there should still be some texture left). Cool. RIESLING SAUCE Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Brush down sides of saucepan with a brush dipped in cold water to prevent crystallization. Cook, brushing down occasionally, to 240 degree F. on a candy thermometer (Soft ball stage). Remove from flame and plunge bottom of pot into ice water to stop cooking. Chill. To serve, roll 3 tablespoons of filling inside each crepe, allowing two crepes per portion. Line up crepes inside a buttered baking dish. Cover with foil buttered on the inside. Heat in a 350 degree F. oven. Transfer crepes to serving plates. Ladle sauce over and around crepes. Garnish with whipped cream if desired, and lavender sprigs. Serves 6.

    <title>Apple Turnovers</title>
    <category>Apples</category>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>2 cups Peeled apples; diced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Chopped pecans</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar; or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 Sheets frozen puff pastry; thawed and chilled</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
      <li>Confectioner's sugar; for dusting</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Plump the raisins in boiling water to cover while you prepare the apples. Combine the apples, nuts, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon in a bowl and toss well. Drain the plumped fruit, stir it in with the other ingredients, and let their flavors marry while you prepare the pastry. On a lightly floured board, one at a time, roll the pastry sheets out to approximately 12 inches square. Trim the outer edges (this is essential for the puff pastry) and cut each sheet into four 6-inch squares, making eight in all. Place a generous 1/3 cup of fruit filling just off center in each square. Moisten the edges of two adjacent sides, fold the opposite sides over, and press to seal. Crimp the edges closed with the tines of a fork. Repeat with the remaining turnovers and chill thoroughly. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Beat together the egg and water and brush lightly on top of the turnover without letting the egg wash drip down the cut sides. Place the turnovers on cookie sheets (for puff pastry, spread a little cold water on the sheets but do not grease; for flaky pie pastry, grease the sheets). Bake until they are puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Serve them warm or at room temperature dusted, if you like, with confectioners' sugar. NOTES : Turnovers can be made in squares or circles of any size and filled with any fruit alone or in combination, savory as well as sweet. They are a fine way to use up leftover bits of this and that, including pastry, and their handy self-packaging makes them excellent picnic fare.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Emily Hirsch &lt;emilyh@dex.com&gt; Date: 16 Sep 1995 08:09:38 -0600 A while ago, I added apricot butter to my usual banana nut bread. I also used apricot jam - the chunks of apricot in the jam added a nice texture. The results were great! Best to have all ingredients at room temperature. Cream butter and sugar. Add egg, lemon zest, banana and apricot butter. Sift flour and baking powder together. Fold flour mixture gradually into the wet ingredients. Mix in walnuts. Pour batter into a bread pan, and bake for about 1 hour at 350 degrees Farenheit. P.S. Apricot butter also makes a nice glaze for pork roast or ham. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Yeast; dry</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Bread flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fig; minced dried</li>

      <li>8 Apple; medium</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Add all ingredients for the dough in the order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the dough cycle according to the manufacturers directions. 2. While the dough is being processed, prepare the topping. Coat two 10-inch cake pans with cooking spray. In a small saucepan, boil the apple juice concentrate over high heat until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Pour the syrup into the two pans, dividing evenly and swirling if necessary to coat the bottoms. Quarter, core, and peel the apples. Cut each quarter into eighths. Arrange apples in concentric circles in each pan, overlapping the apples. 3. When the dough cycle ends, remove the dough from the machine. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Divide the dough in half. On a floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll each piece into a 10-inch circle. Place each circle on top of a pan of apples. 4. Bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until the tops are brown and bubbling around the edges. Remove from the oven. Let rest 5 minutes, then invert onto a plate larger than the pan so that you will not lose any syrup that drips down the sides. Eat warm, not hot.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. 1. Fit the steel knife blade into the work bowl. Process the pecans until chopped into 1/8-inch pieces. Distribute chopped pecans evenly in muffin cups. Put 2 teaspoons melted margarine in each cup. 2. With the steel knife blade still attached, process apricots until chopped into 1/4-inch pieces. Add brown sugar, cinnamon, biscuit mix and milk. Process until batter is well mixed, 10-15 seconds, stopping machine once to scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Pieces of apricots should still be visible. 3. Drop by spoonfuls into muffin cups. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Do not push pick all the way to bottom. Remove from oven and invert muffin pan on a serving plate. DO NOT remove pan; let stand 10 minutes so pecans and margarine will drop down onto muffins.

      <li>5 large Eggs</li>

      <li>Ingredient Group: FIRM APRICOT GLAZE</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Apricot preserves, best quality</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Kirsch, or other fruit-flavored liqueur or fruit juice</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: BASIC ICING GLAZE</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups Sifted confectioners' sugar (4 3/4 ounces; 135 g)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cream, or more as needed to thin the glaze (up to 2)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Lemon or orange extract; or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. A day or two before baking the cake, combine all the dried fruits and nuts in a large bowl and toss well with the rum or Calvados and cider. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place for at least 24 hours. Toss the mixture occasionally. 2. On the baking day, prepare pans. Use one tube pan 10 x 4 inches or one 9 1/4-inch tube pan (9 cup capacity) plus 2 baby loaf pans, each 6 x 3 1/2 x 2 inches, or the equivalent in capacity (cake consists of about 12 cups batter.) Lightly grease pan(s), cut paper liners to cover both bottom and sides, press paper in place, then grease paper. Position rack in center of oven for 1 large cake, or divide oven in thirds for several cakes. Preheat oven to 325 F (165 C). 3. Sift both flours, the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices together onto wax paper. Set aside. To make the cake batter, use a spoon and a mixing bowl or the electric mixer to cream together the butter and sugar until well blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Add the flour mixture in 3 or 4 additions, beating very slowly to blend after each addition. The batter will be quite stiff. Stir in the grated apple and applesauce. Stir the macerated fruit-nut-rum mixture, then add it to the batter along with all the liquid. Stir the batter with a sturdy wooden spoon until well blended; really the best way to blend is with your bare hands. 4. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan(s), filling them about 2/3 continued in part 2</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>My suggestion: line a 9 x 9 inch cake pan or large deep dish pie plate with wax paper. Melt the butter in a small glass cup in the microwave, stir in brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spread as evenly as possible over the wax paper. Original recipe used 10 inch skillet with ovenproof handle. Arrange apple slices (or chunks) in butter sauce. Combine flour, baking powder and salt on a piece of wax paper or in a mixing bowl. In second bowl, beat together sugar, egg, egg white, oil, milk and vanilla. Combine with dry ingredients until just blended. Fold in currants (or raisins) and grated apple. Leave the skin on the apple for extra fiber if you are using a food processor for the grating. Pour into pan over apple layer. Bake at 350 F for 25 to 30 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Set aside to let cool. Carefully invert pan and remove cake to serving plate. Makes 12 servings.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: HERBED PILAF</li>
      <li>2 3/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>6 Chicken bouillon cubes or 6 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Slivered almonds</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped dried apricots</li>
      <li>4 Green onions with tops; sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Snipped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Orange zest</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried rosemary; crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 Boneless turkey breast half about 2 1/2 pounds</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: APRICOT-DIJON SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 cup Apricot jam or orange marmalade</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. For herbed pilaf, bring water to a boil. Add bouillon; stir until dissolved. Cool slightly. Pour bouillon into Stoneware Baking Bowl. Add all remaining pilaf ingredients except turkey; mix well. Remove any excess fat from turkey breast; place on top of rice mixture. Cover with Deep Dish Baker. Bake 45 minutes. Remove turkey from oven; carefully remove Baker with Oven Mitts. For Apricot-Dijon sauce, combine jam and Dijon mustard in Generation II 1 1/2-Qt. Saucepan. Remove 1/4 cup of the sauce; brush onto turkey with Pastry Brush. Set remaining sauce aside. Return turkey to oven; continue baking, uncovered, 25-35 minutes or until Pocket Thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 170°F. Remove turkey from oven. Cover; let stand 10 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, heat remaining sauce over medium heat until warm. Carve turkey with 8" Self-Sharpening Canring Knife. Stir pilaf just before serving, serve with turkey and sauce. Yield: 6 servings. Approximately 630 calories and 17 grams of fat per serving. COOK'S TIP After removing the turkey from the oven, cover it and let it stand for 10 minutes. This standing time will allow the internal temperature of the meat to rise to 180°F, the proper doneness temperature for turkey. Busted by Gail Shermeyer &lt;4paws@netrax.net&gt; NOTES : Excellent for entertaining or a special Sunday dinner, this turkey breast is glazed with an easy apricot sauce for extra moisture and flavor.

In "Fiery Fruits" article by Nancy Gerlach. Gerlach also wrote: "This recipe calls for apricots but peaches, nectarines, and pears work equally well. Any fresh green chile can also be substituted, depending on your heat preference. Serranos will make it hotter; roasted, peeled New Mexican chiles will tame it down."

      <li>2 tablespoons Raisins</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Golden raisins</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make the pastry: 1. With an electric mixer on medium speed, blend the sour crem and butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and salt and blend until the dough comes together, about 30 seconds. 2. Form the dough into 2 disks, wrap in plastic and chill overnight. 3. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let soften slightly, for about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, with a rack in the middle. Lightly grease a baking sheet. 4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each disk to a circle about 9 to 10 inches in diameter and less than 1/8 inch thick. Prepare the Filling: 5. Spread 1/3 cup apricot jam over the surface of 1 disk, leaving a 1/4 inch border around the edges. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the walnuts, 1 tablespoon of the raisins and 1 tablespoon of the golden raisins over the jam. 6. Roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion, pinching the ends together. Carefully lift the roll with your hands and transfer to the baking sheet. With a sharp knife, slice the roll halfway through into about 12 sections. 7. Repeat the procedure with the remaining dough and filling. 8. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Cut the slices through; cool completely on the sheet. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week or freeze for several months.

      <li>Grease and flour a large tube pan or 2 loaf pans. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Combine sour cream, flavorings, and brandy. Alternately add the flour and sour cream mixture to the sugar mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Mix until well blended. Pour into prepared pan or pans. Bake for about 70 minutes. A crack will usually form in the center. Cool for about 30 minutes, then remove from pan and cool completely. Dust with confectioners sugar, or glaze, if desired. Glaze: Mix just enough brandy with the sugar to form a thin mixture. Use a brush to cover the surface of the cake. Helpful hint: I buy small paintbrushes when they are on sale, and use these for such jobs. I put them in the dishwasher. When they get worn, I toss them and get new ones. They are great for brushing on bbq sauce on grilled meats, glazing cakes, and many other uses. Posted to EAT-L Digest 8 November 96 Date: Sat, 9 Nov 1996 13:53:08 EST From: "Sharon H.

      <li>From: Gabriele DANNINGER &lt;A4422DAD@helios.edvz.univie.ac.at&gt; Date: Thu, 19 Aug 93 11:19:24 MEZ The Aprocot Balls (Marillenknoedel) are one of my favourite dishes. It is very popular in Austria. Since I am not used to write recipes in english, there may be some errors in it. Please be not upset. Now follows the recipe. Mix white cheese, butter (soft, not directly from the refrigerator), egg yolks and salt. Add the flour and make a soft mass. Form a roll with a diameter of about 5 cm. Cut slices of about 1 cm, press flat on your hand. Put an abricot (remove the kernel and put in a piece of sugar) on top of it and form a ball. Put into a pot of simmering, slightly salted water. Let simmer for about 10 minutes. Put breadcrumbs, sugar and cinnamon into a pan where you melted the butter and roast it until it takes a golden colour (you can also smell, when it is finshed, but be careful it soon may be too late). Roll the balls in the roasted breadcrumbs, put powdered sugar above and eat very hot. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /COOKIES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>12 ounces Puff pastry</li>
      <li>1 Egg; beaten</li>
      <li>Filling:</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Semolina or dry breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>18 ounces Or more fresh apricots; quartered and pitted</li>
      <li>1 ounce Flaked almonds</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Very fine sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Clear honey</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured board. Trim to give a rectangle of about 12 inches by 5 inches. Using a sharp knife and a ruler, carefully cut out an inner rectangle, 1/2" from the outer edge of the first one, i. e. a rectangle that measures 11 1/2 x 4 1/2". Gently ease out the inner rectangle and lay it on a lightly floured surface, leaving behind a 1/2" wide "frame". Roll out the inner rectangle carefully, increasing its size to 12" by 5". Lay it on a greased baking sheet and brush the edges with beaten egg. Lift up the "frame" of pastry and lay it on the rectangle, which it should fit. Sprinkle the semolina evenly over the inside of this pastry case, then arrange the apricot quarters on top, snuggling them close together as they will shrink in the oven. Sprinkle over flaked almonds and the sugar. Place a baking sheet in the oven and heat to 425 F. Place the tart on the HOT baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 375 F and bake for a further 10 to 15 minutes. As soon as it is cooked, warm the honey in a small pan until runny and brush over the apricots. Serve warm or cold.

      <li>3 tablespoons Lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash the apricots. Cut them in half through the natural indentation and remove the pits. Slice each half into 4 lengthwise strips. There should be approximately 4 quarts. Gently combine the apricot slices, sugar, honey, and lemon juice in a large nonreactive bowl. Allow to stand at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours, stirring several times to keep the fruit coated and to help the juices dissolve the sugar. Pour the fruit mixture into a large 6 quart nonreactive shallow preserving pan and bring toa boil over high heat. With a metal spoon or fine mesh skimmer, skim off any foam that forms on top. Reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 minsutes until the mixture is thick with a few chunks left and appears slightly glazed. Turn off the heat and skim any additional foam. Ladle into hot sterilized jars, wipe rims clean with a damp towel, and seal with new lids and metal rings.Process in a hot-water bath for 5 mins. Remove, cook, check seal, label, and store. Makes 9 cups.

    <title>Apricot Almond Meringue Cookies</title>
    <category>Cookies</category>
    <quantity>48</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 large Egg whites; at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt; or cream of tartar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar; superfine</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 ounces Dried apricots; finely diced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Slivered almonds; lightly toasted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Lightly grease two cookie sheets or, if you prefer, grease parchment or waxed paper spread on cookie sheets. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt or cream of tartar until the whites make soft peaks. To make a tender meringue, gradually add all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar as you continue to beat. Check to see if the sugar has dissolved by pinching the meringue. When you can no longer feel the crystals, fold in the remaining sugar, then the vanilla extract, and finally the apricots and almonds. Drop neat spoonfuls of the meringue batter onto the cookie sheets; give them attractive peaks, as they will not spread or change their shape. Bake for 1hour without opening the door. Turn off the oven and keep them in the unopened oven for at least another hour or as long as overnight. Remove the cookies with a spatula. Store them in airtight tins or, closed tightly in a plastic bag, in the freezer, where they will keep indefinitely. NOTES : These light, tender meringue cookies are a good way to use up extra egg whites.

Let rest about 10 minutes. Gradually beat in the milk. Refrigerate, covered, until very well chilled. I prefer to make it at least 1 month ahead to allow the flavors to meld. When ready to serve, pour the eggnog into a punch bowl. Beat the heavy cream and fold into the eggnog just until blended. Grate fresh nutmeg over the top.

    <title>Apricot Bagel</title>

    <quantity>15</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/8 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Orange extract; optional</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Malt powder; or honey / sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>3 1/3 cups Bread flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Wheat gluten; optional</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Yeast</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Dried apricots; diced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place ingredients in the bread machine in the order listed. Use the dough setting. Add the apricots 5 minutes before the end of the kneading phase or work into the dough before shaping. If you don't have a dough setting stop the machine after the rises. Prepare the baking sheets or use nonstick sheets. Remove dough from the machine, punch it down, and roll it out into a rectangle about 14 x 18. Divide into equal pieces and shape into bagel form or use a cutter. Place the bagels on the sheets and let them rise again. I put them in the oven to provide a draft free location. This rise can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours depending on what else is going on in your life. Fill a 4 to 6 qt soup pot with water 3 to 4 " deep. You can add 2 T of malt syrup, honey, sugar or non-diastatic malt powder. Get the water to boiling. Preheat the oven to 400. Drop the bagels one at a time into the boiling water. Boil only 3 or 4 at a time so they don't crowd. Simmer each side for a minute and return to the baking sheet. Add glazes or toppings as desired. Bake just below the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven. The book calls for 20 to 25 minutes. I usually start at 15 minutes for the 1st sheet and less for the second. These are best eaten while they are still warm. They can be frozen - you may want to slice them first so you can defost them in the toaster. Serving Ideas : for peach bagels sub dried peaches for the apricots NOTES : I use orange oil instead of the orange extract. These are really excellent.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Dried apricots</li>
      <li>1 quart Hot water</li>
      <li>10 large Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 large Onion -- chopped fine</li>
      <li>1 3" piece of fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Vinegar -- (see Note at</li>
      <li>Bottom)</li>
      <li>1 pound Sugar -- (see Note at</li>
      <li>Bottom)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt -- I use at least 1</li>
      <li>Tsp</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cayenne</li>
      <li>1 cup Raisins</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes 5 lbs. Rinse and put the apricots in a bowl with the hot water (I add the juice of 1 lemon and the cut up lemon peel) Leave to soak for 4 hours. Chop the garlic. Peel and chop the ginger. Blend the garlic and ginger with a little of the vinegar until smooth. Put the apricots with their soakings water, the onions, the ginger and garlic mixture into an preserving kettle with the rest of the vinegar. Add the sugar, salt and cayenne. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Add the raisins and continue cooking until the chutney thickens and begins to turn shiny. Pack into hot clean jars, cover, process and cool. --Note : I use brown sugar and regular raisins for a dark chutney - I use white sugar and golden raisins for a golden chutney. I don't blend the garlic and ginger mixture - I simply mince very small or put through a garlic press. You can substitute dried ginger for fresh ginger. Chutney is not supposed to require a hot water bath, because of the acid level from the vinegar - but I give it a hot water bath anyway. You can use apple cider vinegar in this recipe. I use a gas cooktop - and I cook the simmer the mixture with a simmer plate between the pot and the burners. Be sure you use a heavy bottomed pan - to prevent scorching or burning. PS: I always refrigerate the Chutney after opening the jar. "Sweet chutneys provide a delicious finishing touch to cold cuts, cheese and salads. This slightly hot, spicy way of dealing with dried apricots and raisins is an original and ever popular addition to cold, simple fare?
