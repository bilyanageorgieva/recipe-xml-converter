    <title>Basic Bread and Rolls</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>24</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 cups Milk</li>
      <li>1 Fresh Cake Yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Shortening</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lukewarm Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, &amp; salt</li>
      <li>Let it cool to lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water</li>
      <li>When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly</li>
      <li>Pour the yeast/egg mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together</li>
      <li>The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid</li>
      <li>With a large spoon, stir until flour/milk is well mixed</li>
      <li>You should have a firm, but not stiff dough</li>
      <li>Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2 hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen)</li>
      <li>Instead of letting the dough rise at this point you may put it in the refrigerator and use it later, or the next day</li>
      <li>Watch to make sure it doesn't spill out of the bowl</li>
      <li>If it starts to spill before you're ready to use it, punch it back down</li>
      <li>Refrigerated dough is easier to handle but takes longer to rise</li>
      <li>BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from sticking, knead it until springy and easy to handle</li>
      <li>This dough does not require a lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle</li>
      <li>For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into greased baking pans</li>
      <li>Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again</li>
      <li>Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain whether or not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned too)</li>
      <li>ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily handled</li>
      <li>Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter and fold over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls)</li>
      <li>SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round</li>
      <li>Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar</li>
      <li>Dot with butter and roll as for a jelly roll</li>
      <li>Slice and place on a greased pan or make into a circle and make slashes through the dough at intervals</li>
      <li>Let rise and bake as for loaves</li>
      <li>Top with an icing made of confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot</li>
      <li>Decorate with nuts or fruits</li>
      <li>If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white</li>
      <li>The amounts above will yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large rolls</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Sherry</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 dash Pepper</li>

      <li>Leave beef whole</li>
      <li>Cut scallion stalk in 2-inch sections</li>
      <li>Mince garlic and ginger root and combine with soy sauce, sherry, sugar, salt and pepper</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a heavy pan</li>
      <li>Brown beef quickly on all sides</li>
      <li>Add soy-sherry mixture and cook stirring to heat and blend (about 3 minutes)</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, boil water</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Add water to beef and bring to a boil again</li>
      <li>Simmer, covered, until beef is tender (about 1-1/2 to 2 hours)</li>
      <li>NOTE: You may increase the soy sauce to 1/2 cup, the sherry to 1/4 cup; then reserve the gravy as a master sauce</li>
      <li>(See recipe for "Master Sauce".) VARIATIONS: Cut the beef in large chunks</li>
      <li>Cook only 1 hour in step 3</li>
      <li>Cut the beef in 1-1/2 inch cubes</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt; then toss in 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce and 1/2 tablespoon sherry</li>
      <li>Let stand 20 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally</li>
      <li>Then brown as in step 2, but omit the soy-sherry mix</li>
      <li>Cook about 45 minutes in step 3</li>
      <li>Instead of browning the beef, plunge in a pan of boiling water, parboil 2 to 3 minutes, then drain</li>
      <li>In step 1, do not combine the soy sauce and other seasonings</li>
      <li>Instead, after browning the beef in step 2, cook it in the soy over medium heat, until well colored (about 10 minutes)</li>
      <li>Then add the scallion, garlic and ginger root; stir in the sherry, sugar, salt, pepper and 2 cups heated stock</li>
      <li>Cook as in step 3, but omit the boiling water</li>
      <li>In step 2, add any of the following: 2 cloves star anise 3 to 4 anise peppercorns and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1-inch piece of cinnamon stick 1 piece tangerine peel (soaked) 1 tablespoon wine vinegar During the last 30 minutes of cooking, add any of the following: 1 pound cabbage, cut in wedges 1 pound carrots, peeled and cubed 6 celery stalks, cut in 1-inch sections 1/2 pound chestnuts, parboiled 6 eggs, hardboiled and shelled 1/2 cup lily buds (soaked), cut in two 1 pound lotus root, peeled and cubed 1 cup dried black mushrooms (soaked), left whole 1 pound new potatoes, peeled and cubed 1 pound string beans, stemmed 1 pound Chinese white turnips, peeled and cubed During the last 15 minutes of cooking, add 2 cups bamboo shoots, diced</li>
      <li>During the last 10 minutes of cooking, add 2 cups shelled peas or 4 tomatoes, cut in wedges</li>
      <li>NOTE: When adding vegetables, do not also add star anise, anise pepper, cinnamon stick, tangerine peel or wine vinegar</li>
      <li>(These will overwhelm the vegetable flavors.) They are better when the beef is cooked alone</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2/3 cups Clover honey</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Sugar, granulated</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kirsch (cherry brandy) or orange juice</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>Finely grated peel (yellow part only) of one</li>
      <li>Large lemon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped candied lemon peel</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped candied orange peel</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Finely chopped blanched slivered almonds</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups All-purpose or unbleached white flour (or more)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oven to 350F</li>
      <li>Generously grease two 10-by-14-inch or larger baking shets</li>
      <li>Stir together the honey, sugar, and kirsch in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat</li>
      <li>Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar completely dissolves and the mixture is hot but not boiling</li>
      <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the spices, lemon peel, candied peels, and almonds until completely incorporated</li>
      <li>Stirring vigorously, gradually ad 2 1/4 cups of flour to the pan; the mixture will become very stiff</li>
      <li>If the mixture feels sticky and too soft to roll out, stir or knead in a bit more flour, but be careful not to overflour</li>
      <li>Set the mixture aside until cooled to barely warm</li>
      <li>Sprinkle a work surface generously with flour</li>
      <li>Divide the dough in half</li>
      <li>Roll out half of dough into an 8 1/2-by-13-inch rectangle, frequently running a spatula under the dough and dusting the work surface</li>
      <li>As needed, also dust the top of the dough and the rolling pin with flour</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough to a prepared baking sheet</li>
      <li>Repeat with the second half of the dough</li>
      <li>Prick the dough lightly all over with the tines of a fork</li>
      <li>Stagger the baking sheets on racks in the center third of the oven; switch positions halfway through the baking to ensure even browning</li>
      <li>Bake for 13 to 16 minutes or until the dough top is just tinged with brown and slightly darker on the edges; avoid overbaking, as cookies will become crunchy and hard</li>
      <li>Carefully run a spatula under the dough rectangles to loosen them from the pans</li>
      <li>When just cool enough to handle, transfer the rectangles to a cutting board and cut away any uneven, dry edges using a large serrated knife</li>
      <li>Deeply score the rectangles, but do not cut completely through the surface, lengthwise and crosswise, to yield 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars</li>
      <li>Return the scored rectangles to the baking sheets</li>
      <li>In a small saucepan stir together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of water until thoroughly blended</li>
      <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring</li>
      <li>Boil, stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds, until smooth, very fluid, and translucent</li>
      <li>Divide the mixture between the rectangles, pour over the top and quickly spread the glaze over the entire surface</li>
      <li>Let stand until the glaze sets and turns white again, about 1 hour</li>
      <li>Bend the rectangles to break apart or cut through the score marks to separate into bars</li>
      <li>Let stand until the glaze is dry and hard</li>
      <li>Pack airtight</li>
      <li>Store for up to 3 weeks or more</li>
      <li>Makes 50 to 60 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars</li>

      <li>When they are ready, take them out and set aside to cool</li>
      <li>Now remove the centre section of each onion, to leave a shell about 3/4 inch thick</li>
      <li>In a bowl, mix together the lentils, pepper, salt, yogurt, dates, walnuts, raisins or sultanas and bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Fill the onions with this mixture</li>
      <li>Keep any that remains and mix it with the chopped discarded onion centres</li>
      <li>Place the filled onions in an oven proof dish, spoon any remaining mixture around them and cook for about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Garnish with parsley ands serve with bulgur or 'red' rice (see note above)</li>

      <li>1 1/2 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>3 1/2 tablespoons Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>3 ounces Bitterswet (not unsweetened) or swmisweet</li>
      <li>Chocolate, chopped fairly fine</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons (generous) almond extract</li>
      <li>2 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>2 To 5 Tbl confectioners' sugar for rolling out cookies</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 325F</li>
      <li>Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil</li>
      <li>In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar until the almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor and scrape down the sides several times</li>
      <li>Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, and chocolate; continue processing until the chocolate is finely ground</li>
      <li>Add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, the almond extract, and egg whites; process until the mixture is blended and just forms a mass</li>
      <li>Set the dough aside for 5 to 10 minutes to stiffen slightly</li>
      <li>Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar</li>
      <li>If the dough seems too soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead until the consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar than absolutely necessary</li>
      <li>Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, lifting it with a spatula frequently and redusting the surface and rolling pin with powdered sugar to prevent sticking</li>
      <li>Cut out the cookies using a 2 1/4-inch heart-shaped (or similar) cutter</li>
      <li>Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart</li>
      <li>Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and slightly puffy</li>
      <li>Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until completely cooled</li>
      <li>Peel from the foil</li>
      <li>Store airtight for 3 to 4 days</li>
      <li>Freeze, airtight, for longer storage</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>(see "The Basics: Rice" for amounts)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>Wash rice thoroughly, then spread evenly along the bottom of a saucepan</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Add the desired quantity of cold water for each cup of rice</li>
      <li>(Let rice and water sit covered in pan for 30 minutes before cooking</li>
      <li>This softens the rice, but can be omitted.) 3</li>
      <li>Bring rice to a boil over 3/4 flame</li>
      <li>Boil covered 3 minutes</li>
      <li>Reduce flame to 1/2</li>
      <li>Boil 2 minutes more, or until most of the liquid is absorbed</li>
      <li>(At this point, before the water is completely absorbed, some cooks stir the rice gently from the bottom up so that it will cook more evenly and have less tendency to burn on the bottom</li>
      <li>If some rice sticks to the sides of the pot during this stirring, just scrape it down.) 4</li>
      <li>Lower flame to a minimum</li>
      <li>Let rice cook covered 18 to 20 minutes more</li>
      <li>Do not lift lid or stir rice during this time</li>
      <li>(If you lift lid, valuable steam will escape; if you stir the rice, it will stick to the bottom of the pan</li>
      <li>When cooking is done, some cooks lift the lid and stir the rice once, loosening it gently with a lifting motion of chopsticks, then replace the lid and let the rice stand for 10 minutes.) 5</li>
      <li>Turn off heat</li>
      <li>Let rice sit covered in pan 10 to 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Then, with fork or chopsticks, fluff rice to separate each grain</li>
      <li>The rice will then be soft, flaky and ready to serve</li>
      <li>NOTE: Cooking time for rice varies from stove to stove and from pan to pan</li>
      <li>Only actual experience can determine the precise cooking time</li>

      <li>start the machine and see how it looks</li>
      <li>If too dry, add until it looks right</li>
      <li>Should be one big mass not several</li>
      <li>Flour: I often substitute 1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of gluten for a cup of WW flour</li>
      <li>For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar (I commonly use honey, molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins</li>
      <li>3 T of carroway seeds or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great</li>
      <li>I have also added 2 mashed bananas, then cut the water</li>

    <title>Basic Arepa Dough</title>
    <category>Sides</category>
    <category>April97</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Pre-cooked masa flour; (yellow or white)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>3 cups Water; boiling</li>
      <li>Butter; softened</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and Venezuela</li>
      <li>They were an important part of their diet, like corn tortillas were to the Aztecs</li>
      <li>Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela continued to use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of nourishment</li>
      <li>Today, these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for the rich and poor alike, a heart-warming tribute to simplicity, tradition, versatility, and good taste</li>
      <li>Originally, arepas were made from dried corn kernels that were soaked overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained and ground into masa (dough)</li>
      <li>Thanks to modern technology, a pre-cooked harina de masa is now available at most Latin American markets</li>
      <li>An instant masa can be made by simply mixing this corn flour (either white or yellow) with a little salt and enough boiling water to make a stiff dough</li>
      <li>The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses, depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or deep-fried</li>
      <li>In parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab that is first heated and then brushed with fat</li>
      <li>Another Colombian specialty -- arepas de chocolo -- are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of banana leaves</li>
      <li>Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan counterparts</li>
      <li>The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a flat bread roll, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside</li>
      <li>They can be split open and buttered, or spread with cream cheese or fresh goat cheese</li>
      <li>Made this way, they are served for breakfast or as an accompaniment for grilled fowl, fish, meat stews, or sausages</li>
      <li>In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the shell is filled with savory mixtures of ground or chopped pork, beef, ham, chicken, seafood, vegetables, or beans</li>
      <li>They are excellent first courses</li>
      <li>Venezuelan mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped into rings and deep-fried</li>
      <li>Another specialty is bollos pelones -- balls of arepa dough stuffed with seasoned ground meat, either fried or poached in water, then served with tomato sauce</li>
      <li>A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh cheese and fried chorizo (sausage)</li>
      <li>Colombians also make tasty soups using fresh masa or leftover arepas</li>
      <li>Arepitas dulces make great desserts</li>
      <li>The versatile arepa indeed proves that unpretentioius food can be not only satisfying but also delicious</li>
      <li>Directions: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt</li>
      <li>Add water, stir with a wooden spoon to make a soft dough</li>
      <li>Let stand for 5 minutes, then knead for 3 minutes</li>
      <li>Dough is ready to be shaped into standard arepas, or to be mixed and kneaded with other ingredients such as cheese, chicharrones (pork rind), etc</li>
      <li>To shape arepas: The standard Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4 inch thick</li>
      <li>Columbian arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 inch thick</li>
      <li>To make arepas, oil or wet hands lightly and shape dough into balls</li>
      <li>Place between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap and flatten into a circle; shape the edges to form a smooth disc</li>
      <li>To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat; grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of times until a crust is formed</li>
      <li>Colombian arepas are ready to be served at this point, spread with butter</li>
      <li>Venezuelan arepas have to be baked in a preheate 350-degree oven for 15 minutes</li>
      <li>To check for doneness, tap the arepa lightly -- if a hollow sound is heard, it's ready</li>
      <li>Split open, add butter and serve hot</li>
      <li>Arepas freeze well if frozen while still warm</li>
      <li>Freeze in layers separated by plastic wrap</li>
      <li>Reheat frozen arepas wrapped in aluminum foil in a preheated 350-degree oven for 10 minutes or until heared through</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: INFO ONLY</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Baking is a joy, not a chore, and should never be undertaken if you are feeling rushed</li>
      <li>Use your imagination and alter the add-ins as you see fit</li>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>Always read through the entire recipe before starting to Bake</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Start with ingredients at room temperature</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Always Bake bars, squares and cookies in the centre of the oven on the middle rack</li>
      <li>If baking more than one pan at a time, place them at different angles on different racks to allow maximum circulation of heat</li>
      <li>Alternate their placement on the racks halfway through the baking time</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>The best pans are aluminum or metal pans that are light in colour</li>
      <li>Dark pans will cause the base or bar to Bake and brown more quickly</li>
      <li>5</li>
      <li>If using glass dishes, reduce oven temperature by 25 degrees and slightly decrease the baking time</li>
      <li>6</li>
      <li>Use only the size of pan called for</li>
      <li>The difference between an 8-inch square pan and a 9-inch square pan can mean the difference between a moist, chewy bar and an under baked, heavy failure</li>
      <li>7</li>
      <li>Check baked goods at earliest time indicated</li>
      <li>Over baking will dry out bars and squares</li>
      <li>8</li>
      <li>If making a sticky or fluffy batter or base, wet your hands or spatula with water before patting or spreading the batter in the pan</li>
      <li>9</li>
      <li>Let most bars cool completely before cutting</li>
      <li>There are exceptions, however</li>
      <li>Bars with a sticky filling need to have a knife run around the edge of the pan after being removed from the oven to prevent sticking</li>
      <li>10</li>
      <li>Score chocolate-topped bars as soon as the topping is applied to prevent the chocolate from cracking later</li>
      <li>11</li>
      <li>Use metal or plastic dry measures for measuring dry ingredients and glass wet measures for measuring liquid ingredients</li>
      <li>12</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour does not need to be sifted</li>
      <li>However, when a recipe calls for cake-and-pastry flour, the flour should be sifted and then measured</li>
      <li>13</li>
      <li>Store nuts in the freezer to retain their freshness</li>

    <title>Al's Chicken Schnitzel</title>
    <category>Poultry</category>
    <category>Main dish</category>
    <quantity>3</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 kilogram Chicken Breasts</li>
      <li>4 large Eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and Australian currency</li>
      <li>In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in half as described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs about $10 to serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed potato and mini carrots etc and children can have 1</li>
      <li>This is my first Recipe so here goes</li>
      <li>Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts</li>
      <li>Use Spiked Mallet to beat chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim any skin or get skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories</li>
      <li>Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate</li>
      <li>On second plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate</li>
      <li>On third put the bread crumbs on it</li>
      <li>Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg either by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs and put on plate</li>
      <li>On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so that the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is very soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the cooking for the family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or what but they taste best that way.Just cook them and when the look cooked cut in half and if the meat is white(like chicken sould look not the colour of an uncooked fillet) they are cooked.I cook on medium heat in a frypan with some oil</li>
      <li>Serving Suggestions: In the Colder months this meal is best served with Mashed potato and gravy as well as carrots and any other vegetables you like</li>
      <li>In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger</li>
      <li>I put the lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin pineapple ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a filling and tasty meal</li>
      <li>Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Onions finely diced</li>
      <li>5 Cloves garlic; minced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Sweet paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>3 cups Milk</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted chicken stock</li>
      <li>2 large Yuca; peeled and diced</li>
      <li>4 Ears yellow corn; sliced 1" thick</li>
      <li>Juice of one lime</li>
      <li>3 pounds Chicken; in bite size pieces</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe is for a Cuban stew/soup that I used to enjoy con mucho gusto</li>
      <li>This version of Ajiaco was prepared by Senora Garcia in her little store front restaurant on Collins Ave</li>
      <li>in Miami Beach</li>
      <li>Although this is not her exact recipe, it's the closest I could get to it</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a 6 qt</li>
      <li>pot over medium heat</li>
      <li>Cook chicken pieces in the butter until no longer pink</li>
      <li>Remove chicken with slotted spoon and place in in a bowl</li>
      <li>Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored with the paprika</li>
      <li>Add stock, milk, yuca, corn, and chicken to the pot</li>
      <li>Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yuca is tender</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and stir in lime juice</li>
      <li>Serve with Cuban or French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden</li>
      <li>As an alternative, frozen corn on the cob will work, as well fresh frozen kernels</li>
      <li>The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to this dish</li>
      <li>If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims</li>
      <li>This dish received rave reviews at the 1991 Blind Pass Marina Xmas Party</li>

    <category>Snacks</category>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <category>Vegan</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Corn/maize meal</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Soy flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Chili powder (optional)</li>
      <li>Sugar to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Corn/maize was introduced to Africa from Latin America by the Portuguese, mainly to provision their slave ships</li>
      <li>The grain was quickly accepted because it grew rapidly and undemanding in cultivation</li>
      <li>The name 'maize' comes from 'mahiz', the word used by the Caribbean Taino Indians from whom the Europeans probably first learned about the crop</li>
      <li>in North American the English settlers were shown it by local Indians</li>
      <li>'Corn' was a general name given to any grain, so they called it simply 'Indian corn'</li>
      <li>Columbus noted that maize was "most tasty boiled, roasted or ground into flour"</li>
      <li>And in southern Ghana today a common food is 'kenkey', fermented corn/maize flour balls, wrapped in corn/maize leaves and steamed</li>
      <li>Akpith, this recipe, is more straightforward</li>
      <li>DIRECTIONS: =========== In a large saucepan, boil the water and then in half of the corn/maize meal and all the soy flour to make a thick porridge</li>
      <li>Add the baking powder, chili powder if using and sugar; season</li>
      <li>Cook this for 10 minutes over a low heat, stirring constantly</li>
      <li>Then remove the pan and set aside to cool for 10 minutes or so</li>
      <li>At this point, mix in the remaining corn/maize meal and combine thoroughly, adding water to produce a stiff dough</li>
      <li>Now pour enough oil into a pan or wok to give a depth of around 2 inches (5 cms), and heat up</li>
      <li>While it is warming mould the dough into balls about 1 inch (2.5 cms) in diameter</li>
      <li>With the oil sizzling hot, slide 4 or 5 balls carefully into the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>[I think this recipe assumes raw crabmeat to start; refer to instructions below about boiling crab meat and alter technique if using pre-cooked crab meat, perhaps by just boiling some ginger and cloves in small amount of water and adding a bit to flavor crab</li>
      <li>-- cmt] Put crab meat in boiling salted water along with ginger piece and cloves</li>
      <li>Cook about 15 minutes, until meat is tender enough to flake with a fork</li>
      <li>Drain, flake and set aside</li>
      <li>In a heavy pot, heat oil to a moderate temperature and add other ingredients in the following sequence, stirring for a minute or so between each: onions, ground ginger, tomatoes, tomato paste, green pepper, paprika, cayenne, and dried shrimp</li>
      <li>Reduce heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are cooked</li>
      <li>Add crab meat and stir another couple of minutes to heat it through</li>
      <li>Then spoon the mixture into clean crab shells or ramekins (small individual baking dishes)</li>
      <li>Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of each crab and toast under an oven broiler, being careful not to let the crumbs scorch</li>
      <li>Garnish with egg and parsley</li>

      <li>Drain again and rinse under cold running water</li>
      <li>Put the tasajo in a large, heavy pot and add about 6 quarts of water</li>
      <li>Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 1 hour</li>
      <li>Add the pork, beef brisket, and bay leaf, and let the three meats cook together until tender</li>
      <li>Remove the pot from the heat and skim as much fat as possible from the broth</li>
      <li>(If you have time, the best way is to refrigerate the broth overnight until the fat solidifies and then remove it.) Make the Sofrito: Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and saute the onions and green pepper until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes</li>
      <li>Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes more</li>
      <li>Add the pepper, cumin, and tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes</li>
      <li>Add the sofrito to the broth and simmer, covered, while you prepare the vegetables</li>
      <li>Complete the Dish: Peel the malanga, boniato, name, yucca, and calabaza and cube them</li>
      <li>Cut the corn and green plantains&amp;nbsp;into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>With a knife slit the skin of each piece of greenplantain by opening it away from the center as if you were taking off a coat</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the plantain pieces with the lime juice</li>
      <li>Slit the semi-ripe and ripe plantains lengthwise and slice them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch rounds</li>
      <li>Do not remove their skins or they will disintegrate in the stew</li>
      <li>Add the green plantains to the simmering stew</li>
      <li>After about 15 minutes, add the semiripe plantains</li>
      <li>After another 15 minutes, add the ripe plantains and let them simmer for about 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Serve hot in soup plates or, cocido-style, with the meats, vegetables, and broth in separate dishes</li>
      <li>( Each diner removes the skin from the semi-ripe and ripe plantains themselves.) Recipe By : TVFN - Taste - Show # 4881 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #314 Date: Sun, 24 Nov 1996 15:53:26 -0500 From: Doc1946@aol.com</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 large Chopped onion</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Salad oil</li>
      <li>7 cups (about 3-1/2 pounds) drained sauerkraut</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Paprika</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: John Levin &lt;jlevin@paonline.com&gt; Date: Fri, 02 Aug 1996 22:55:34 -0400 Here's another recipe which is a great favorite of ours, and which I clipped from a newspaper (Washington Post?) about 15 years ago</li>
      <li>It's called "Albanian Chicken", although I've never seen an Albanian Cookbook, and have never seen another Albanian recipe, it seems like something my great grandmother would have cooked</li>
      <li>The use of sauerkraut as a stuffing seems weird, but is characteristic of Middle European cooking</li>
      <li>You often find it mixed with apples...here it's mixed with paprika and caraway seeds</li>
      <li>The stuffing is sensationally delicious, and the chicken comes out extremely tender, every time</li>
      <li>This is a recipe you have to cook to understand</li>
      <li>Saute onion in oil until golden, stirring often</li>
      <li>Combine sauerkraut, paprika, and caraway seeds with onion</li>
      <li>Spoon as much kraut mixture as possible into the body cavity of the chicken</li>
      <li>Reserve remainder of kraut for later Place chicken on roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan</li>
      <li>Bake at 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours</li>
      <li>Remove pan from oven, take chicken out</li>
      <li>Pour off fat in bottom of pan</li>
      <li>Spread remaining kraut in bottom of pan and set chicken in pan</li>
      <li>Bake another 1/2 to 1 hour to brown</li>
      <li>Season as desired</li>
      <li>Leftovers make great sliced chicken and sauerkraut sandwiches</li>
      <li>(If your mail program renders the times weird looking, they're 1.5 hurs for baking, and .5 to 1 hour for browning</li>

    <title>Alan Ladd's Chuck Wagon Pepper Steak</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 London Broil (about 3 lbs.)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Unseasoned meat tenderizer</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Instant onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Marjoram</li>
      <li>1 cup Red wine</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Thyme</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Cracked peppercorns</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I don't know if this is exactly the Pepper Steak recipe requested earlier by I</li>
      <li>Chaudhary, but it's one of our favorites</li>
      <li>We eat this practically year-round and it's good hot or cold</li>
      <li>Makes terrific sandwiches the next day</li>
      <li>My mom found this recipe years ago in a magazine - Woman's Day or Family Circle, I think - that featured celebrity chefs</li>
      <li>This was from Alan Ladd - and I probably just dated myself with that one (I'm really not that old!)</li>
      <li>For those who don't know who Alan Ladd was, he was a great movie star - best movie was "Shane" - at least a three hanky</li>
      <li>Anyway, here's the recipe</li>
      <li>Sprinkle meat with tenderizer, pierce with a fork (make lots of pierces so the marinade soaks thru), and place in baking dish</li>
      <li>Mix rest of ingredients, except peppercorns, in a bowl and pour over meat</li>
      <li>Lift meat up so marinade gets under it and can soak through</li>
      <li>Marinate overnight (I usually start this in the evening and let it marinate overnight and all the next day) in refrigerator, turning frequently</li>
      <li>When ready to grill or broil, remove meat from marinade and pound half the peppercorns into each side</li>
      <li>Broil to desired doneness</li>
      <li>Slice meat thinly and on the diagonal and serve</li>
      <li>We always cook this on our grill outside</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful taste - very peppery and if you like it spicier, add more peppercorns</li>
      <li>I've given up measuring them</li>
      <li>Hint: I take whole peppercorns, put them in a zippered heavy-duty plastic bag, and pound them with my meat mallet</li>
      <li>We've also tried different red wines for the marinade - burgandy, sangria, etc</li>
      <li>And get a bottle large enough to enjoy some while you're grilling! Posted to EAT-L Digest 29 October 96 Date: Wed, 30 Oct 1996 09:51:55 -0500 From: "Raymond F</li>

      <li>Salt; (sea salt preferred) and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Optional garnish: extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cook's note: You can save preparation time by using canned cannellini beans</li>
      <li>Use two (15 1/2-ounce) cans</li>
      <li>Use one can of beans whole; puree the beans in the other can</li>
      <li>If you use canned beans, skip the first three steps of the recipe</li>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>Place dried beans in a large pot</li>
      <li>Cover with cold water and allow to rest overnight or for 8 hours</li>
      <li>Drain</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Cover beans with cold water and bring to boil</li>
      <li>Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 40 minutes or until beans are thoroughly cooked and softened, but don't overcook them</li>
      <li>Drain beans, keeping the cooking water for later use</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Divide the beans in half</li>
      <li>Leave half whole and process the other half until pureed in a food processor fitted with the metal blade</li>
      <li>Set aside</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large soup pot on medium heat</li>
      <li>Add parsley, garlic, celery, carrots and onions</li>
      <li>Cook 30 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally</li>
      <li>5</li>
      <li>Add tomatoes and stir to combine</li>
      <li>Cook 15-25 minutes</li>
      <li>Add the whole beans and the cabbage (or Swiss chard) to the soup</li>
      <li>Add enough water to cover the ingredients and bring to a boil on high heat</li>
      <li>Simmer 30 minutes</li>
      <li>6</li>
      <li>Add bean puree to soup</li>
      <li>Stir to combine</li>
      <li>Add enough boiling water to make the soup liquid</li>
      <li>The exact amount of liquid will vary; you need to balance the amounts of liquid to the bread so that when the bread absorbs the liquid, the soup is very thick</li>
      <li>Stir in bread and season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Simmer 4 minutes, or longer if you wish the bread to further dissolve into the soup</li>
      <li>If you wish, stir in a little extra-virgin olive oil, or use it as a garnish on top of the soup after it has been ladled into individual bowls</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 4-5 ounce Alaskan Rock Fish</li>
      <li>Flour; for dredging</li>
      <li>1/2 Stick butter</li>

      <li>1 Lime; juice of</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's the recipe for the Alaskan Rock Fish that I fixed for Hank's birthday</li>
      <li>It's a very tender, mild white fish</li>
      <li>I fried the fillets just like we do on Friday nights at our fish fry</li>
      <li>The rock fish almost fell apart just turning them in the pan</li>
      <li>Anyway, here's what I did</li>
      <li>I floured the fillets</li>
      <li>In a hot skillet, I melted about 1/2 stick of butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil (I use the Extra Virgin)</li>
      <li>Then I added a large clove garlic (minced) and about 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger (minced) and fried the fish for about 2-3 minutes (just until golden), turned it and seasoned (freshly ground sea salt and freshly ground black pepper)</li>
      <li>When the fish was golden on the 2nd side, I added the juice of 1 lime and served immediately</li>
      <li>We didn't use any additional sauce (just the pan sauce) and it was really great! It's such a mild fish, I probably over did it with the garlic and ginger, but since I really like those flavors, it tasted great to me</li>

    <title>Alan's Jerk Marinade</title>
    <category>Sauce</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Scallions (finely chopped)</li>
      <li>1/2 large White or yellow onion (coarsely chopped)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh thyme leaves (chopped; tough stems removed) (up to)</li>
      <li>3 Habanero chiles (to desired heat level) (see note)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Jamaican allspice (freshly ground)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Soy sauce (I use tamari)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vinegar (white or cider)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground black pepper (and pepper medley)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Sugar (I use raw sugar)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon (freshly ground)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Nutmeg (freshly ground)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Alan L</li>
      <li>Edwards (ale@cisco.com) Put all ingredients except the scallions and thyme in a blender (or food processor) and puree</li>
      <li>Then add the remaining ingredients and run the blender until the ingredients are well mixed, but not pureed</li>
      <li>Makes a little more than 1 cup (enough for about 2 pounds of meat)</li>
      <li>Recipe scales well</li>
      <li>Sauce can be kept refrigerated for a month, or frozen for a "long time"</li>
      <li>NOTE: Pickled Habaneros will do just fine if you can't find fresh; but I've found that they are not as hot as fresh ones (like maybe half as hot)</li>
      <li>You could also substitute Habanero-based sauce</li>
      <li>But only use sauce that has a low amount of other spices (unless it's allspice)</li>
      <li>One of my latest variations uses about 3 Tbs of Alan's Special Mild Habanero sauce for flavor; and enough Habaneros or Scotch Bonnet sauce to bring the heat up to the right point</li>
      <li>Jamaican jerk is usually made with Scotch Bonnet chiles, which are closely related to the Habanero (they are both of the species Capsicum Chinense), but harder to find (for me anyway)</li>
      <li>I'm not sure of the taste differences</li>
      <li>+ To judge the heat, taste when it's all mixed together and add more if you want it hotter</li>
      <li>It's hard to tell how hot the final product will be the first time you make this, but you will get used to judging the heat eventually</li>
      <li>For me, the right level is achieved when 1/8 tsp of the jerk sauce is enough to make me want water (but I'm used to capsaicin)</li>

      <li>Lightly oil six 7- to 8-ounce capacity heat-proof cups</li>
      <li>Set cups on trivet in steaming vessel, add hot water to come up to bottoms and leave on stove</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Heat milk and bay leaves to simmer in heavy saucepan over medium heat</li>
      <li>Turn heat to low and simmer uncovered until reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Remove leaves, rinse and wipe clean</li>
      <li>Set 1 fresh leaf or 1/2 a dried leaf in bottom of each cup, shiny side down</li>
      <li>Set steamer over medium heat</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Combine eggs, egg white and Worcestershire in measuring cup</li>
      <li>If not 1 cup, make up difference with more egg white</li>
      <li>Turn into mixing bowl and whisk until blended, beating in as little air as possible (bubbles make holes in finished custard)</li>
      <li>Slowly pour through fine wire mesh strainer into clean bowl</li>
      <li>Whisk in pepper and salt</li>
      <li>Stir while pouring mixture into cups to keep pepper grains distributed</li>
      <li>Pour gently, so leaf stays in place</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>Lay foil over cups and cover vessel tightly</li>
      <li>Steam, water barely simmering, until a metal skewer emerges clean just inside edge of cup, 17 to 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Center should quiver slightly (eggs will continue cooking once out of steamer)</li>
      <li>Cover cups loosely with foil and refrigerate</li>
      <li>May be unmolded after 4 hours or next day</li>
      <li>When cool, cover cups tightly</li>
      <li>5</li>
      <li>To unmold, run thin knife around custard, against sides of cup</li>
      <li>Set small dish on top, turn over</li>
      <li>If custard doesn't slip out, hold cup in place and whack gently but firmly on counter</li>
      <li>Scrape any custard off leaf, remove scraps of custard and pour about 1 tablespoon caramelized sugar syrup over top</li>
      <li>CARAMELIZED SUGAR SYRUP: 1</li>
      <li>Cook sugar in a broad skillet (preferably non-stick) over medium heat, shaking skillet frequently, until sugar melts completely and turns rich amber, about 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Do not allow to get darker, or syrup will be bitter</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and cool 1 to 2 minutes</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Add 1/2 cup boiling water, stirring with wooden spoon</li>
      <li>Cook over low heat, stirring, until hardened caramel melts-be patient</li>
      <li>Turn into measuring cup and add water to make 1/2 cup</li>
      <li>Refrigerate in tightly covered jar</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>True shallots (echalotes) are gradually becoming more widely available</li>
      <li>They look rather like a large, loose head of garlic with glossy red-brown skin</li>
      <li>Clean and peel 12 large Jerusalem artichokes</li>
      <li>Put a little olive oil in a roasting pan, add the artichokes and roast in a medium oven until golden, a little caramelized and cooked through - about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Peel and slice 12 cloves of true shallots</li>
      <li>Brush 28 scallops lightly with oil on both sides</li>
      <li>Have ready 4 kaffir lime leaves (or substitute zest from the limes)</li>
      <li>Wash 8 wing beans (or substitute 4 very small bok choys about 10 cms tall - halve them lengthwise) and blanch in boiling water</li>
      <li>Put the blanched vegetables in 4 large bowls (pasta bowls or similar), together with the whole roasted artichokes, and scatter the sliced shallots over the top</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, in a saucepan com- bine 600 mL fish stock, the juice of 3 limes, Thai fish sauce to taste (about 2 tablespoons) and pepper to taste and bring to the boil</li>
      <li>Heat an iron grill or heavy frying pan to a very high heat</li>
      <li>Do not grease</li>
      <li>Throw in the oiled scallops and sear them very quickly on both sides, so that they take colour on the outside but are barely warm inside</li>
      <li>Divide the scallops between the soup bowls, top with the lime leaves and pour in the broth</li>
      <li>Serve</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Raw almonds</li>
      <li>1 pound Raw filberts</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Tamari</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground chipotles</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt; (to taste)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Kit Anderson-- Nuts are very easy to do on a smoker</li>
      <li>I have smoked them at cooler temps and high temps and they seem the best when done at 300F for 1/2 hour</li>
      <li>That would be over the hot spot in an offset smoker</li>
      <li>Any wood will do but hickory is especially nice</li>
      <li>Get raw nuts in bulk at your health food store</li>
      <li>Almonds, filberts, pecans, walnuts, peanuts are all good</li>
      <li>The nuts need to be moist in order for the smoke to stick</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of melted butter is right for 1 pound of nuts</li>
      <li>You can also spray them with Pam</li>
      <li>I recently have found 2 tablespoons of tamari soy sauce gives a wonderful subtle richness and will hold the smoke and spices</li>
      <li>This also leaves them with a nice, dry coating</li>
      <li>They will also need salt</li>
      <li>Use a fine grain, not coarse kosher, to taste</li>
      <li>After tossing with butter, tamari, or Pam, add your spices</li>
      <li>You can get very elaborate or not</li>
      <li>I like heat and will sometimes add some hot sauce to the butter</li>
      <li>Try any of the seasoned salts</li>
      <li>One recipe from the chileheads list asked for 2 TABLESPOONS of Dave's Insanity in the butter</li>
      <li>These were hot</li>
      <li>No...they were HOT</li>
      <li>Weird thing was, that burned cat flavor from Dave's had vanished</li>
      <li>Here's my recent effort that got a 'best ever' from the wife</li>
      <li>Toss nuts with tamari in a bowl until completely coated</li>
      <li>Add salt to taste and chiles</li>
      <li>Spray baking sheet with Pam and arrange nuts in a single layer</li>
      <li>Smoke at 300 for 1/2 hour stirring once after 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Allow to completely cool so that they will be crunchy</li>
      <li>These are great with beer, in oatmeal, and on salads</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I've posted the Bajan Beans and Rice recipe that I adapted from a recipe of Gabe Mirkin's before</li>
      <li>This is one of my most favorite recipes and when I was making it today I found out halfway through that I didn't have any canned white beans</li>
      <li>I forgot that I had bought some dried white beans intending to cook them up myself</li>
      <li>No problem I had two cans of black beans and so decided to try the recipe with them</li>
      <li>I liked it just as much and it made the dish even more colorful</li>
      <li>The canned black beans I had weren't quite as mushy as the white beans I have used before -- the final product was less soupy</li>
      <li>For those who may have missed the recipe, here it is again, this time with black beans: Heat 3 cups of water and mix in bouillon</li>
      <li>Set aside</li>
      <li>Note: any broth may be used, I just happen to like Better Than Bouillon especially</li>
      <li>Saute garlic, onion, and red, green, and habanero peppers in 1/2 cup of broth in large pot for 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Add remaining broth, tomatoes, and rice and simmer covered for 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Add zucchini and simmer for an additional 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Stir occasionally to keep from sticking</li>
      <li>Add black beans, corn, and cilantro and cook an additional 5 minutes to heat through</li>
      <li>Freezes well</li>

      <li>To make your soufflé rise higher, let egg whites sit at room temperature 20 minutes before beating them</li>
      <li>Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry</li>
      <li>Lift beaters up from bowl to see if peaks hold their shape</li>
      <li>Fold egg whites into the soufflé mixture by cutting down through the center of the mixtures, across the bottom, and up the sides of the bowl</li>
      <li>Give the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat folding and turning until mixtures are blended</li>

    <title>Bajan Black Bean Soup</title>
    <category>Soups</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Dried black beans; soaked overnight</li>
      <li>1 large Ham hocks; Or 2 small</li>
      <li>3 quarts Water; up To 3.5</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 large Onions; up To 3</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>3 small Fresh green peppers; (jalapeanos if preferred)</li>
      <li>8 Berries allspice coarsely crushed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Brown sugar; (or 1 t of molasses)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Tomato paste</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Creme fraiche or sour cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Salt Grated rind and juice from one lemon Put the drained beans and hock in a very large pan, cover with the cold water and bring gradually to a boil</li>
      <li>Leave to simmer while you prepare the other ingredients</li>
      <li>In a frying pan heat the olive oil, then gently fry the onion, garlic and chili with the allspice and lemon rind, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent</li>
      <li>Add this mixture to the beans and go on simmering for 2 hours, by which time the beans should be tender</li>
      <li>At this point add the sugar, lemon juice, and tomato puree</li>
      <li>Cook for another 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Add salt if necessary</li>
      <li>Remove the hock, and pick off any meat</li>
      <li>If you would like a smooth soup, as mine (the author) was, process the mixture in batches and return with the meat to the pan</li>
      <li>Otherwise, for a rougher texture crush with a potato masher</li>
      <li>If the mixture seems too thick at this stage, add more water and bring back to the boil for a minute or two</li>
      <li>Ladle the soup into bowls, with a spoonful or two of cream stirred in, and serve with a crusty bread</li>
      <li>If you are feeling lavish, a couple of spoons of dark rum added towards the end give a Bajan fillip</li>
      <li>NOTES : Arriving stiff and crumpled inside and out after an eleven hour flight, this was my first taste of Bajan Cooking, and I ate it late at night trying to imagine the sea beyond a dark frieze of langourous palms</li>
      <li>Dense but smooth, with a snap of chili, the soup was both homely and exotic, and very restoring</li>
      <li>Barbados produces splendid ham and bacon, and a ham stock is what makes this different from other Carribean variants</li>
      <li>Or, as here, use a hock, soaked first to remove some salt</li>

      <li>Can't say I've tried it myself; I only bring back Cockspur VSOR and I'm not about to cut it with sherry</li>
      <li>As for amounts, I mostly saw 12 oz bottles of rum in the non-tourist stores and would use that as a starting point: Remove stems from the peppers and place in a bottle, then cover with rum and leave for two weeks</li>
      <li>Strain and dilute to required "hotness" with sherry</li>

      <li>2 slices Onion</li>
      <li>2 Stalks celery with leaves</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Stewed canned tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chili sauce</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a great way to use up leftover baked beans, and the regularity with which this soup was served in Shaker communities indicates that they had a lot of leftover beans</li>
      <li>The dish was an absolute staple, and I think it is really very good ..</li>
      <li>and certainly hearty</li>
      <li>Put the beans, water, onion, and celery in a saucepan and bring to a boil for 30 minutes</li>
      <li>They would rub this through a sieve, but I put mine through the food processor</li>
      <li>Do the same with the tomatoes and add to the soup</li>
      <li>Add the chili sauce and seasonings</li>
      <li>Melt the butter and cook with the flour for 2 minutes to form a roux</li>
      <li>Stir the roux into the soup and keep stirring over medium heat until the soup thickens a bit</li>
      <li>You might also try mustard or horseradish for a variation</li>
      <li>These additions were common in the Hancock Shaker community</li>

    <title>Baked, Pressed Tofu</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>x Tofu</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>x Favorite spices</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: dcross@pts.mot.com (Daniel Cross X8663 P5108)</li>
      <li>About the quickest tofu recipe I know is this one: Mix some flour (about .5 cup) with your favorite spices (I like cayenne)</li>
      <li>Press most of the water out of a block of tofu with a towel, then slice it up any old way</li>
      <li>Dip the slices in soy sauce, then in the flour/spice mix, and place on a baking tray</li>
      <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes (a toaster-oven is great for this)</li>
      <li>If you like them browned a little more, put them under the broiler for 5 min</li>
      <li>before serving</li>
      <li>From: samv@netcom.com (Sam Voeller)</li>
      <li>sort of a boring tofu user myself, but one recipe I have is so yummy I use it in all sorts of things</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees (f) cut tofu (firm) into 1" cubes dip cubed tofu in soy sauce, and dust on all sides with fresh-ground black pepper set on lightly oiled (or non-stick) baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, turning once so that all sides are browned evenly</li>
      <li>This gives the tofu some real, chewable texture, as well as a spicey zing</li>
      <li>I use these tofu chunks in thick stews, or just over steamed veggies</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 medium Chicken</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: MARINADE</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Tamarind water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Clear soya sauce</li>
      <li>A pinch of chilli powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>A pinch of turmeric</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The name means simply 'fried chicken', and that is all it is</li>
      <li>The marinade, however, gives it a characteristically Indonesian flavour</li>
      <li>Marinate the pieces of chicken in this mixture for 2 hours, turning them from time to time</li>
      <li>Strain the chicken, so that the marinade drips away from it</li>
      <li>Then deep-fry the portions, 4 or 5 at a time</li>
      <li>Chicken fried in this way is excellent with Nasi Goreng</li>
      <li>[Nasi Goreng is fried rice</li>
      <li>S.C.] Makes 4 servings</li>

      <li>Wolfert writes: "If you run out of preserved lemons, or decide on just a few day's notice to cook a chicken, lamb, or fish dish with lemons and olives and need preserved lemons in a hurry, you can use this quick five-day method taught to me by a Moroccan diplomat's wife</li>
      <li>Lemons preserved this way will not keep, but are perfectly acceptable in an emergency." With a razor blade, make 8 fine 2" vertical incisions around the peel of each lemon to be used</li>
      <li>(Do not cut deeper than the membrane that protects the pulp.) Place the incised lemons in a stainless-steel saucepan with plenty of salt and water to cover and boil until the peels become very soft</li>
      <li>Place in a clean jar, covered with cooled cooking liquor, and leave to pickle for approximately 5 days</li>

      <li>It did not include a sauce</li>
      <li>If I remember correctly, the poster said to serve with Ranch Dressing for a sauce</li>
      <li>I would just let my imagination go, on the sauce! I haven't tried this yet, even though it is tempting...I have to watch out for my husband's diet, so we try to stay away from fried things</li>
      <li>Sorry, I don't know the name of the original poster, but that is his/her ID, after the recipe title</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 ounce Butter</li>
      <li>2 To 3 Spring Onions,Green And White Parts, Chop -- * see note</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Grated Orange Peel</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Grated Lemon Peel</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground Coriander -- ** see</li>
      <li>Note</li>
      <li>6 fluid ounces Oz Single (Light) Cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Plain Yoghurt</li>
      <li>Salt And Freshly Ground</li>
      <li>Black Pepper -- to taste</li>
      <li>2 To 3 Avocados</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* shallots work just as well, although you need more ** we really like coriander, so we put in a couple of teaspoons Melt butter in a saucepan, add spring onions and stir-fry 1 minute</li>
      <li>Then add orange and lemon peel and coriander</li>
      <li>Remove from the heat while you prepare cream and yoghurt</li>
      <li>Pour cream into a small bowl and add yoghurt, salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Mix well until smooth</li>
      <li>Peel, stone and chop avocados (the size you chop the pieces is personal preference, but we usually chop into about 1.5 cm cubes)</li>
      <li>Add the avocado to the ingredients in the pan, pour yoghurt mixture over and very gently heat through</li>
      <li>DO NOT BOIL or avocados will become soggy and sauce will curdle</li>
      <li>Pour over pasta, toss and serve at once</li>

      <li>1/2 pints Whipping Cream</li>
      <li>1 Avocado peeled, rubbed with lemon and sliced 1/2 inch thick. Sauce--</li>
      <li>3 Medium or 4 Large ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and seeded</li>
      <li>Squeeze of Lemon Juice</li>

      <li>3 Medium shrimp per serving. peeled, deveined, lightly poached.</li>
      <li>2 Basil Leaves (whole)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>As you cut avocados drizzle lemon juice on them so that they will not darken</li>
      <li>Mash avocados in a bowl and add the mustard and worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl lightly whip the 1/2 pint of whipping cream</li>
      <li>The cream should be a little loose, soft peak stage is the technical term</li>
      <li>Fold cream into avocado mixture</li>
      <li>Place parchment paper in a standard bread pan so that there is enough paper to cover the top of the filled terrine</li>
      <li>Spray the parchment with release spray</li>
      <li>Fill the terrine with 1/2 of the mixture, and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Remove terrine from refrigerator, slice the extra avocado and drizzle lemon juice on it to keep it from darkening, place the slices on the top of the chilled mixture</li>
      <li>Pour other 1/2 of the avocado melange on top</li>
      <li>Drizzle some lemon juice on top and fold parchment paper over top</li>
      <li>Refrigerate for 35 to 40 minutes</li>
      <li>While the terrine is chilling, peel devein and barely poach the shrimp, let the shrimp cool in the poaching liquid if possible</li>
      <li>Set the shrimp aside for the garnish</li>
      <li>Separate nice looking basil leaves for garnish</li>
      <li>Prepare the sauce; roughly cut the tomato into bite size pieces, place in a small frying pan or saucepan and stew them slightly</li>
      <li>Add a little lemon juice and the cream, mix in a few stray leaves of the basil cut into strips</li>
      <li>The goal is to quickly cook off some of the liquid</li>
      <li>Let this sauce cool to room temperature or below before saucing the dishes</li>
      <li>To unmold, sit the terrine in some warm water for 1 minute or less, and unmold onto a platter</li>
      <li>Slice into 3/4 inch thick pieces and place the shrimp and basil on the plate with the terrine</li>
      <li>Spoon some of the basil rich sauce over the top.</li>

      <li>Wolfert writes: "If you run out of preserved lemons, or decide on just a few day's notice to cook a chicken, lamb, or fish dish with lemons and olives and need preserved lemons in a hurry, you can use this quick five-day method taught to me by a Moroccan diplomat's wife</li>
      <li>Lemons preserved this way will not keep, but are perfectly acceptable in an emergency." With a razor blade, make 8 fine 2" vertical incisions around the peel of each lemon to be used</li>
      <li>(Do not cut deeper than the membrane that protects the pulp.) Place the incised lemons in a stainless-steel saucepan with plenty of salt and water to cover and boil until the peels become very soft</li>
      <li>Place in a clean jar, covered with cooled cooking liquor, and leave to pickle for approximately 5 days</li>

    <title>Avocado with Crab</title>
    <category>Salads</category>
    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Ripe avocados</li>
      <li>15 ounces Crab meat or</li>
      <li>1 pound Fresh crab meat</li>
      <li>8 Tb mayonnaise</li>
      <li>4 To 6 drops Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Finely minced, peeled celery stalks</li>
      <li>Salt, depending on the saltiness of the crab meat</li>
      <li>1 pinch White pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch Cayenne or</li>
      <li>1 drop To 2 drops Tabasco</li>
      <li>1 Head iceberg lettuce</li>
      <li>2 Lemons</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>Split the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits</li>
      <li>With a melon-ball cutter, gently enlarge the cavity toward the stem end</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>With a fork, mash the avocado pulp which was removed</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Mix the pulp with 4 tbs</li>
      <li>of the mayonnaise, salt if needed, pepper and cayenne or Tabasco</li>
      <li>Gently fold in the crab meat and the celery</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>Divide the crab mixture among the eight avocado halves</li>
      <li>5</li>
      <li>Mix the Worcestershire sauce with the remaining 4 tbs</li>
      <li>mayonnaise</li>
      <li>With a pastry bag or a cone made from wax paper, pipe approximately 1/2 tbs</li>
      <li>of the mayonnaise mixture on each filled avocado half</li>
      <li>6</li>
      <li>Remove the outside leaves of the iceberg lettuce</li>
      <li>Arrange the leaves on a serving platter</li>
      <li>Cut the inside part of the lettuce into very thin strips and make 8 small nests on the leaves lining the serving platter</li>
      <li>Place an avocado half on each nest</li>
      <li>7</li>
      <li>Cut each lemon in quarters and garnish the serving platter with the slices of lemon</li>
      <li>Serve</li>
      <li>If desired, offer additional mayonnaise separately</li>
      <li>CHEF'S SECRET: When you buy avocados, they should not be soft but, if pressed gently, should give about the same resist-ance as an orange</li>
      <li>Once at home, pack each avocado in a brown paper bag and leave them at room temperature overnight</li>
      <li>Of course, chill before serving</li>
      <li>If you use canned crab meat, it is advisable to pick it over</li>
      <li>Sometimes you may find a small piece of the shell</li>
      <li>Definitely taste it for saltiness</li>
      <li>Certain brands improve with a quick rinsing with water</li>
      <li>If you have to rinse it, don't do it under the faucet</li>
      <li>Place the meat in a sieve and dip the sieve in a small amount of water</li>
      <li>Loosen the meat with one finger, then remove the sieve from the water and shake the meat dry</li>
      <li>The flavor will not be destroyed, but the saltiness of the canning liquid will be gone</li>
      <li>Enlarging the cavity of the avocados with a melon-ball cutter has two purposes; you have the subtle taste of the pulp in the crab mixture, and it is easier to arrange the filling without making it messy</li>
      <li>Definitely peel the celery stalks for this dish with a potato peeler so that no strings get into the salad</li>
      <li>The celery is needed for its crunchy texture to counterbalance the softness of the avocado and mayonnaise and the fleshy chewiness of the crab meat</li>
      <li>If you do not care for the taste of celery, you can substitute peeled, seeded, finely chopped cucumber</li>
      <li>Makes 8 servings</li>

      <li>Some errors that stop imports are very difficult to see and others are really quite easy</li>
      <li>When you try to import IMPORT.ER1* or you import manually you got some error messages; the most common and frightening is "@ing at or before line #.." And you LOOK and just don't see ANYTHING</li>
      <li>Well there IS something there that is not correct...and here is a list and examples of the most common errors</li>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>The difference between l (the LETTER) and 1 (the NUMBER) is slight but MM accepts only NUMBERS in the quantity column</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>A backwards slant 1\2 is INCORRECT...1/2 is fine</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>A range of numbers is a NO NO...4-6 eggs won't do; pick 5..</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>The two digits in the UNIT OF MEASUREMENT column should include ONLY LETTERS</li>
      <li>When in that column, hit F1 for a complete list of the only acceptable abbreviations</li>
      <li>5</li>
      <li>Be sure that all the units of measure start on the ninth column</li>
      <li>(9 spaces from the left) 6</li>
      <li>The ingredient column can be only 39 columns long</li>
      <li>Once you get used to these common errors your eye will pick it up quickly</li>
      <li>I hope this helps..</li>
      <li>*NOTE: "IMPORT.ER1 is the file that MM creates (when you choose that option) to copy your flawed recipes</li>
      <li>The ones that download with errors</li>
      <li>Sometimes it is difficult to SEE what is wrong with them</li>
      <li>This 'recipe' helps you pick up the common errors</li>

      <li>1 cup Walnuts, chopped</li>
      <li>Rum, vanilla, or amaretto (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F</li>
      <li>Cream the shortening and sugar</li>
      <li>Mix in the bananas</li>
      <li>Mix in the remaining ingredients</li>
      <li>Pour into a greased loaf pan</li>
      <li>Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F</li>
      <li>NOTES: * This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but moist, loaf of banana bread</li>
      <li>* If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you lower the oven temperature and cook for a while longer</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the crust comes out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost undercooked</li>
      <li>: Difficulty: easy</li>
      <li>: Time: Preparation: 10 minutes; baking: at least 95 minutes</li>
      <li>Allow some time for cooling</li>
      <li>: Precision: Approximate measurement OK</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon White pepper</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: AZAFRAN SOUP</li>
      <li>6 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Azafran (see note)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons White pepper</li>

      <li>3 cups Corn kernels</li>
      <li>1 Bunch spinach, washed and stemmed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the dumplings, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and sugar together in a bowl</li>
      <li>Add the butter and milk and mix well to make a batter that is moist but not sticky</li>
      <li>If the dough is too moist, knead in a little more flour</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 1" balls, flatten, and shape into small triangles</li>
      <li>Pour the chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil over medium heat</li>
      <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and drop in the dumplings</li>
      <li>Cook 3 to 4 minutes, until tender and cooked all the way through</li>
      <li>Remove the dumplings from the stock and set aside</li>
      <li>For the soup, heat 2 cups of the water and the azafran in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced by half, about 7 minutes</li>
      <li>Pour through a fine sieve, discard the azafran, and return the liquid to the saucepan</li>
      <li>Add salt, pepper, stock, and the remaining 4 cups of the water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat</li>

      <li>Add cork kernels and simmer another 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Add dumplings and spinach, cook 2 minutes, and serve immediately</li>
      <li>**Note** Azafran, also called Native American saffron my the American Indians, is an herb that is actually fine threads from the stigma of the safflower plant</li>
      <li>Despite the name, azafran is not the same as saffron, which is an expensive spice derived from the crocus plant in the iris family</li>
      <li>(Saffron can be substituted for azafran, though: use 1 pinch of saffran for 2 tablespoons of azafran)</li>
      <li>Azafran is commonly sold in Latin American markets and specialty herb stores</li>
      <li>It can also be ordered by mail</li>
      <li>It is best stored in a cool dark place and will last several months in a sealed plastic or glass container</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Contemporary Southwest, The Cafe Terra Cotta Cookbook (1995), by Donna Nordin The avocado in this soup turns a traditional potato-based soup into something the French would never recognize! Because of the richness of the avocado, we can use milk instead of cream without compromising the texture</li>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>Steam or boil the potatoes until soft and let cool</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, roast, peel, and seed the poblanos</li>
      <li>Roast the tomatillos and onions until lightly charred</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Combine the roasted vegetables and potatoes in a food processor or blender and puree</li>
      <li>Add the serrano chile, cilantro, mint, lime juice, ginger, and avocado and puree until smooth, adding milk as necessary to facilitate the blending</li>
      <li>Transfer to a bowl or storage container and thin to the desired texture with milk</li>
      <li>Add salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Chill</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Taste the chilled soup for seasoning and correct if necessary</li>
      <li>Mix the sour cream and chipotle chile together and drizzle over each bowl soup as a garnish</li>
      <li>Note: Normally this soup is served cold, but it can be reheated gently and served warm</li>
      <li>If you prefer it less spicy, leave out the chipotle garnish and simply garnish with a sprig cilantro</li>

      <li>[Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra 4ozs of plain chocolate, and got perfect results</li>
      <li>I think as long as you're using *really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa solids, it doesn't really matter!] Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3</li>
      <li>Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt</li>
      <li>Set aside</li>

      <li>Add the melted chocolate and beat on low for 10 seconds more</li>
      <li>Scrape down the bowl and beat for an additional 30 seconds</li>
      <li>Add the sifted flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips, and beat on low until thoroughly combined - about 20 to 30 seconds</li>
      <li>Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula</li>
      <li>Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons of batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking sheets</li>

      <li>Ingredient Group: NONE</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>~ -- Thai fish sauce, called nam pla</li>
      <li>This amber-colored, odoriferous liquid - -- used in everything from stir-frys to sauces -- cooks down to a mellow undertone</li>
      <li>Better brands are lighter colored and less pungent; Squid is a recommended brand</li>
      <li>~ -- Dried shrimp</li>
      <li>Salty and intensely flavored, these are used primarily as a seasoning ingredient</li>
      <li>Usually sold in 4-ounce packages, dried shrimp should be plump and resilient, retaining enough moisture to evidence a little "give" when squeezed</li>
      <li>~ -- Thai chili sauce, called sriracha</li>
      <li>This is a sort of chili-garlic "catsup," fiery, flavorful and slightly sweet</li>
      <li>Huy Fong Foods Inc., of Rosemead, Calif., makes an excellent sriracha, packaged in a clear plastic squeeze bottle with a drawing of a rooster on the front</li>
      <li>~ -- Holy basil</li>
      <li>Thai cooking uses many different types of basil, and this type is intensely mint-flavored</li>
      <li>Unless you grow it yourself, holy basil can be difficult to find; fresh mint makes a good substitute</li>
      <li>~ -- Thai "bird" peppers</li>
      <li>These little hot peppers, usually green but sometimes red, pack a notoriously powerful punch and are not for sissies</li>
      <li>Serrano peppers make a good substitute if Thai chilies are unavailable</li>
      <li>~ -- CHILIES-IN-VINEGAR SAUCE (Makes about 1/2 cup); hot and sour ingredient in soups and pad thai etc</li>
      <li>1/2 cup distilled white vinegar 1/2 tablespoon Thai fish sauce 12 small Thai chilies, or 3 serrano chilies, finely sliced Combine all of the ingredients in a small serving bowl</li>
      <li>Let stand for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to develop</li>

      <li>Toss dressing with vegetables and place mixture in a large salad bowl</li>
      <li>Drain fish; gently flake and scatter around edge of bowl</li>

    <title>About Vanilla Beans</title>
    <category>Information</category>
    <category>Vanilla</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Information only</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Information from the 1996 Old Farmer's Almanac, "What You Can Eat To Achieve True Peace of Mind", by Ken Haedrich The vanilla orchid is a member of the plant family known as Orchidaceae and is the only orchid that produces edible fruit</li>
      <li>The beans grow on a thick vine that flourishes in warm, moist climates within 25 degrees of the equator</li>
      <li>The vanilla plant begins to bear fruit when it is three or four years old</li>
      <li>Eight to nine months after pollination, the beans are golden yellow and ready for harvest and curing</li>
      <li>It takes about five to six pounds of green, freshly picked vanilla beans to make one pound of properly cured beans</li>
      <li>There are basically two ways to cure the beans: in the sun or over a fire</li>
      <li>Using the solar method, beans are spread in the hot sun by day and wrapped in blankets and placed in wooden boxes by night</li>
      <li>The sweating process is repeated over and over for six months, until the beans have lost up to 80 percent of their moisture content</li>
      <li>This method produces superior results and is used in Madascar, Mexico, the former Bourbon Islands, Tonga, and Tahiti</li>
      <li>The wood-fire curing method, used in Indonesia and Bali, takes only two or three weeks, but produces a dry, brittle bean with a smoky flavor, generally considered inferior</li>
      <li>When you buy a vanilla bean at your market, the black, oily, smooth pod you're buying is a cured bean</li>
      <li>When you purchase a bottle of pure vanilla extract, you're buying beans whose flavor components have been dissolved in a solution of water and alcohol</li>
      <li>By law, pure vanilla extract must contain at least 35 percent alcohol by volume</li>
      <li>Anything less is labeled a flavor</li>
      <li>Pure vanilla extracts come in a variety of folds, or strengths</li>
      <li>The Food and Drug Administration has established that a fold of vanilla is the extractive matter of 13.35 ounces of vanilla beans to a gallon of liquid</li>
      <li>Strong, pure extracts, such as four-fold, are primarily used in mass food production</li>
      <li>What about imitation vanilla? ~---------------------------- Not only is pure vanilla expensive, but demand also far exceeds the world's supply of the real thing</li>
      <li>Stepping in to fill the void is the chemist, who has come up with a variety of imitations made from synthetic vanillin, the organic component that gives vanilla its distinctive flavor and fragrance</li>
      <li>Most synthetic vanillin is a byproduct of the paper industry, made by cooking and treating wood-pulp effluent</li>
      <li>But since vanillin is only one of more than 150 flavor and fragrance compounds found in pure vanilla, the chemist has yet to match the subtlety with which Mother Nature has endowed the real thing</li>
      <li>How to tell a good bean when you see one</li>
      <li>~---------------------------------------- Quality is key</li>
      <li>To truly experience all the flavor and fragrance vanilla has to offer, you have to seek out quality beans and extracts</li>
      <li>Generally speaking, look for beans that are supple and aromatic</li>
      <li>Tahitian beans are moister and relatively short and plump, with thin skins and a floral aroma</li>
      <li>Bourbon beans (so called because they originate in Madagascar, Reunion, and the Comoros, formerly known as the Bourbon Islands) are slightly dryer, contain more natural vanillin, and have thick skins (the flavor has nothing to do with bourbon whiskey.) Stay away from dry, brittle, or smoky-smelling beans</li>
      <li>Depending upon quality and variety, single vanilla beans retail from about $1.50 to $10 apiece</li>
      <li>Vanilla beans should be kept at room temperature in an airtight container</li>
      <li>Don't refrigerate them or they may develop mold</li>
      <li>Vanilla beans last up to two years</li>
      <li>Especially if you cook with it often, it is more economical to buy pure vanilla extract by the pint, or even the quart, and share it with a friend</li>
      <li>The best pure extracts contain no caramel and artificial color and little or no sugar</li>
      <li>Store extract at room temperature, tightly closed</li>
      <li>It will keep up to five years</li>

    <title>About Yeast Breads - Ingredients</title>
    <category>Crocker</category>
    <category>Info</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1 x See Below Flour: All-purpose flour is the most widely used flour</li>
      <li>It contains a special protein called gluten the structure builder of bread</li>
      <li>When mixed with liquid and kneaded or beaten, the gluten stretches and gives elasticity to the dough by trapping bubbles of gas formed by the yeast</li>
      <li>Some flours, such as rye and whole wheat, lack sufficient gluten and usually are used in combination with all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Self rising flour, which already contains leavening and salt, is not often recommended for yeast breads</li>
      <li>However, all recipes were tested with self rising flour; adjustments are indicated when necessary</li>
      <li>Yeast: Yeast is a live plant that gives off a gas that makes dough rise: It is very sensitive-too much heat will kill it, but cold will stunt its growth</li>
      <li>Yeast is available in several forms: regular active dry yeast, quick-acting active dry yeast and compressed yeast</li>
      <li>All of our recipes have been tested with dry yeast</li>
      <li>Most of the recipes follow the traditional method of dissolving the yeast in warm water (105 to 115F)</li>
      <li>However, some recipes yield better results by mixing the yeast with the flour, then beating in very warm water (120 to 130F)</li>
      <li>Liquids: Water or milk are the most commonly used liquids</li>
      <li>Water gives bread a crisper crust; milk, a velvety texture and added nutrients</li>
      <li>Sweeteners: Sugar, honey or molasses provide "food" for the yeast, enhance flavor and help brown the crust</li>
      <li>Salt: A flavor agent that is needed to control the growth of the yeast and prevent overrising, which can cause the bread to collapse</li>
      <li>Fat: Added to contribute to tenderness and flavor</li>
      <li>Eggs: For flavor, richness and color, eggs are sometimes added</li>

      <li>Cool, strain and store in a covered jar in the refrigerator</li>
      <li>It will keep for several months</li>
      <li>If the seeds are cooked too long, the orange color will change to a golden color and much of the flavor is lost</li>
      <li>Very stale seeds will give off all their color in one minute of cooking</li>
      <li>Watch the saucepan carefully and remove it from the heat immediately the color begins to lighten</li>

    <category>Main dishes</category>
    <category>Appetizers</category>
    <category>Spreads and</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Dungeness crab meat; picked over (lump crab meat is ok)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Old bay seasoning</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground thyme</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Dry mustard</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground white pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cayenne pepper powder; optional</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fine dry breadcrumbs; unseasoned</li>
      <li>1 Egg; beaten</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sliced green onions or fresh cilantro; whichever you prefer</li>
      <li>2 ounces Crab fat; (if available and optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large bowl gently fold all the ingredients together adding the bread crumbs last</li>
      <li>Try not to break the crab meat up into small pieces</li>
      <li>Depending on how moist the crab mixture is you may want to use less</li>
      <li>The less bread crumbs you can use as a binder the better the crab cakes are in my opinion</li>
      <li>I would not add more than a quarter cup</li>
      <li>Chill the mixture covered 1 or 2 hours in the refrigerator and they will form a better cake when you are ready cook them</li>
      <li>This is very important</li>
      <li>Not only will they form a better cake but the consistency will be nicer</li>
      <li>To cook use enough mixture to form a large silver dollar sized cake and saute lightly in oil about 1/2 inch deep ( I prefer a good olive oil ) until golden brown, turning once</li>
      <li>These can be served hot or cold as a main entree or appetizer</li>
      <li>Makes about 12 cakes depending on the size</li>
      <li>NOTES : Combination of recipes made 3/28/93-10/2/93-3/26/94 and 7/19/97 I prefer Dungeness crab meat but will use Blue Crab select lump meat when available</li>
      <li>This is my favorite crab cake as of this writing</li>
      <li>I am beginning to use Japanese Panko in my crab cakes as it seems to be lighter</li>

      <li>See Below</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Use loaf pans of anodized aluminum, darkened metal glass for bread with well-browned crusts</li>
      <li>Shiny cookie sheets or muffin cups produce sweet rolls u tender, golden brown crusts</li>
      <li>Stagger loaf pans on a lower shelf of the oven so they do not touch sides of the oven or each other</li>
      <li>The top of each pan should be level with, or slightly above, the middle of the oven</li>
      <li>If baking round loaves on a cookie sheet, place the sheet on the center rack</li>
      <li>Doneness is determined by tapping the crust</li>
      <li>The loaf will have a hollow sound when done</li>
      <li>Remove loaves from pans immediately and place on wire racks away from draft</li>
      <li>to cool</li>
      <li>For a shiny, soft crust, brush just-baked loaf with margarine, butter or shortening</li>
      <li>STORING Bread and rolls can be stored in airtight containers in a cool dry place for 5 to 7 days</li>
      <li>Refrigerate only in hot, humid weather</li>
      <li>Breads can be stored, tightly wrapped in moistureproof or vaporproof material, labeled and dated, in the freezer for 2 to 3 months</li>
      <li>To thaw, let stand wrapped at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours</li>

    <title>About Yeast Breads - Yeast Doughs</title>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1 x See Below There are basically two kinds of yeast doughs-kneaded and batter</li>
      <li>Both doughs need to rise before shaping and baking</li>
      <li>To let dough rise, cover and keep in a warm, draft-free place</li>
      <li>If necessary, place covered bowl of dough on wire rack over a bowl of warm water</li>
      <li>Kneaded dough: Kneading develops the gluten and results in bread with an even texture and a smooth, nicely rounded top</li>
      <li>After first addition of flour has been beaten in, dough will be very soft and will fall in "sheets" off rubber spatula</li>
      <li>The second addition of flour makes the dough stiff enough to knead</li>
      <li>Mix in only enough flour so dough leaves side of the bowl</li>
      <li>To knead, fold dough toward you</li>
      <li>With heels of hands, push dough away with short rocking motions</li>
      <li>Give dough a quarter turn; repeat</li>
      <li>When dough is properly kneaded, it will feel elastic and the top will be smooth with some blisters appearing on the surface</li>
      <li>Dough should rise until double</li>
      <li>Test by pressing fingertips 1/2 inch into dough</li>
      <li>If impression remains, dough has risen enough</li>
      <li>Punch down center of dough with your fist</li>
      <li>Fold dough over and form into a ball</li>
      <li>This releases large air bubbles to produce a finer texture</li>
      <li>If dough is not sufficiently kneaded, the bread will be coarse, heavy, crumbly and dry</li>
      <li>Batter dough: Batter breads are really shortcut no-knead yeast breads</li>
      <li>Because less flour is used, the dough is stickier; instead of being kneaded, it is beaten with a mixer with the first addition of flour</li>
      <li>The batter is generally not shaped but spread in the pan</li>
      <li>The bread has a coarser texture and pebbled surface</li>
      <li>REFRIGERATING YEAST DOUGH Yeast dough made with water (except</li>
      <li>plain bread dough) can be refrigerated up to 5 days</li>
      <li>However, if milk and at least 1/4 cup sugar are used, refrigerate no longer than 3 days</li>
      <li>After mixing dough, grease top well</li>
      <li>Cover with moistureproof wrap, then a damp cloth</li>
      <li>Keep cloth damp during storage</li>
      <li>When ready to bake, shape dough; let rise until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours</li>
      <li>Bake as directed</li>

    <title>Avocado Corn Relish</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 cups Fresh corn kernels; (5 to 6 ears)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 Avocados; peeled and seeded</li>
      <li>4 Poblano chiles; roasted, peeled and seeded, (see Note)</li>
      <li>4 Scallions; white and light green parts only, thinly sliced on the diagonal</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Red wine vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH6176 Saute the corn with the salt and pepper, about 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside to cool</li>
      <li>Cut the avocados, bell pepper and roasted poblanos into 1/4 inch dice</li>
      <li>Add to the sauted corn along with the scallions, vinegar and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>Mix well and let sit 20 to 30 minutes to blend the flavors</li>
      <li>Serve at room temperature</li>
      <li>Corn relish can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator up to 1 day</li>
      <li>To make 2 to 3 days in advance, mix all the ingredients except the avocado and store in the refrigerator</li>
      <li>Add the avocado shortly before serving</li>
      <li>Yield: 6 cups Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler</li>
      <li>Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh</li>
      <li>Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes</li>
      <li>(If you are rushed, you can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits</li>
      <li>Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices</li>
      <li>Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds New potatoes; scrubbed</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Prepared horseradish</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh dill sprigs loosely packed thick stems removed</li>
      <li>3 Celery ribs; strings removed cut in 1/4" crescents (1 cup)</li>
      <li>2 medium Avocados* or 1 lg. avocado</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lime juice; freshly squeezed</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Choose avocados that are firm, with just a slight give</li>
      <li>If the avocado is soft enough to hold an indentation, it's overripe and won't have the rich nutty flavor that you want for this salad</li>
      <li>Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer</li>
      <li>Cut potatoes in half; place them in the steamer basket</li>
      <li>Cover and steam until they are cooked through, about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Remove the potatoes from the heat and allow them to cool slightly</li>
      <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk oil and vinegar together in a large bowl</li>
      <li>Season to taste with salt; set aside</li>
      <li>When potatoes are cool enough to handle without burning your fingers, cut them in 1" cubes</li>
      <li>Toss them in the oil and vinegar so they are coated well, and set them aside to cool to room temperature, tossing occasionally</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, yogurt and horseradish</li>
      <li>Mince the dill and add it to the sour cream mixture, stirring well</li>
      <li>When potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add celery and toss to combine</li>
      <li>Then add the sour cream mixture; toss again</li>
      <li>Halve, pit and peel the avocados</li>
      <li>Cut them into 1" cubes; place in a small bowl with the lime juice</li>
      <li>Toss so the cubes are moistened with the juice</li>
      <li>Then add the avocados, with all of the lime juice, to the potatoes; toss gently until they are well distributed and coated with the dressing</li>
      <li>Add pepper and additional salt to taste, and either serve immediately or chill for 30 minutes and then serve</li>
      <li>While Loomis says that this salad does not keep well and shouldn't be counted on for leftovers, she says that it's one of the most popular potato salads she's ever made</li>

    <category>Salads and</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Avocado</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Chipotle Hot Sauce; at room temperature, or canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Warm water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sundried tomatoes; (oil packed) drained and chopped</li>
      <li>1 Lime</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Skin the avocado, cut it in half lengthwise, and remove the pit</li>
      <li>Slice the halves lengthwise into 6 to 10 thin slices, and fan them out on small plates (3 to 5 slices per serving)</li>
      <li>Combine the chipotle sauce, water, and sundried tomatoes in a blender, and puree</li>
      <li>Spoon a fine, decorative line across the fanned avocado slices</li>
      <li>Cut the lime in half</li>
      <li>Squeeze a bit of juice from one half of the lime over the top of each fan; cut the other half into 4 thin slices</li>
      <li>Garnish the plates with lime slices and serve</li>
      <li>Note: Avocado should be ripe, creamy, and of the Haas variety (the nubbly black avocados, not smooth the green-skinned ones, which can be watery)</li>
      <li>A delicate, deep red line of hot sauce painted across the avocado is visually dramatic, and the spiciness accentuates the avocado's cool smoothness</li>
      <li>This dish makes an elegant and very easy first course for a dinner party</li>

      <li>Stand the bowl in a pan of boiling water and stir until the mixure begins to thicken, then turn off the heat and continue to stir</li>

      <li>Tom's comments: I find the vinegar taste to be overwhelming</li>
      <li>You may want to remove one tb of vinegar or double-triple the sugar</li>
      <li>The vinegar taste does lessen with time, but I would not want to bet a meal on doing things that way</li>
      <li>I WILL do this again (I like it!) and shall try the things I stated above</li>

    <category>Quick dishe</category>
    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 ounces Pasta with shape (e.g., penne or spirals)</li>
      <li>1 Lemon</li>
      <li>1 Avocado</li>
      <li>1 80g pkg Boursin with herbs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 deciliters Koffieroom</li>
      <li>50 grams Achterham</li>
      <li>1/2 Bakje tuinkers</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Translations: "achterham" is a nice sliced lunchmeat-type ham</li>
      <li>For a vegetarian dinner, omit this; or, maybe, replace with mushrooms</li>
      <li>"tuinkers"</li>
      <li>Hmmm...I really don't know the English name for this, or recall seeing anything similar</li>
      <li>It's in the cress family, but smaller-leaved than watercress</li>
      <li>You buy a little box (the bakje) that is filled with a sponge-like block</li>
      <li>The tuinkers are sprouting from that, maybe one inch high</li>
      <li>You take you kitchen shears or a knife and cut off what you want</li>
      <li>Anybody know what this is? They're good sprinkled in a salad</li>
      <li>I suppose you could use some kind of sprouts, maybe mixed, with radish sprouts included for the peppery taste</li>
      <li>Peel the avocado and remove the seed</li>
      <li>Cut into chunks and place in food processor (or blender)</li>
      <li>Wash the lemon</li>
      <li>Into the processor, finely grate half the peel, avoiding the white part</li>
      <li>Add the juice from half the lemon to the processor (other half not used)</li>
      <li>Add the Boursin and koffieroom to the processor</li>
      <li>Whiz till smooth</li>
      <li>Pour into a small saucepan</li>
      <li>Warm over low heat from about 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cut the ham into strips</li>
      <li>Cut the tunikers from their bed</li>
      <li>Stir into sauce</li>
      <li>Add S&amp;P to taste</li>
      <li>Serve over a shaped pasta</li>
      <li>Penne was good, but maybe try something a bit smaller</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Butter</li>
      <li>2 Eggs; well beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup Pureed avocado; (the riper, the better the flavor)</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Buttermilk; (I subbed some sour cream...you use what you got!!)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Nutmeg; freshly ground</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Allspice</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups All purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped dates; (I subbed dried cherries)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Golden raisins</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Walnuts; (I used pecans)</li>
      <li>1 pint Heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Light rum</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Confectioners sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>from "Maurice's Tropical Fruit Cook Book" by Maurice de Verteuil (some modifications in directions made) Cream sugar and butter together</li>
      <li>Add eggs; mix well</li>
      <li>Add avocado puree; mix well</li>
      <li>Lastly, add buttermilk</li>
      <li>Combine spices, salt, soda and flour</li>
      <li>Gradually, add dry ingredients to wet beating well; it should be on the stiff side</li>
      <li>Add dates, raisins and walnuts</li>
      <li>Turn into a greased 9x9 inch baking dish and bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean</li>
      <li>Combine cream, rum, salt and sugar and beat until stiff</li>
      <li>(Of course, you must have your bowl and beaters chilled to accomplish this!)</li>
      <li>Chill</li>
      <li>Serve a "dollop" of this cream on each piece of avocado cake</li>
      <li>NOTE: This recipe can be doubled and baked in a 9x13 inch pan</li>
      <li>The cooking time remains the same</li>
      <li>I have never made the cream topping</li>
      <li>I prefer to make a simple glaze with confectioners sugar, lime juice and milk, although keeping the cake "plain" is just fine</li>
      <li>This is a lovely, moist, mildly spicy, old fashioned cake</li>
      <li>People will guess that it is a carrot or zucchini cake if they don't know what the "secret" ingredient is</li>
      <li>The batter is a lovely shade of green, but the cake bakes up a brown color</li>

    <title>Avocado-Tomatillo Sauce</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Ripe avocados; peeled, pitted and chopped</li>
      <li>4 Medium-to-large tomatillos*; chopped</li>
      <li>2 Or more habaneros; minced, (seeded or not as you prefer)</li>
      <li>1 Onion; minced</li>
      <li>As many garlic cloves as you want; minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Lime juice; or to taste</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Since there seems to be something of a "green recipe" thread running through the list at the moment, I thought I'd submit a favorite of mine</li>
      <li>This derives from the "Habanero Cookbook," by Dave DeWitt and Nancy Gerlach, where it was introduced as a sauce for fish</li>
      <li>* If using fresh tomatillos, husk them, then boil about 10 min</li>
      <li>or until soft in unsalted water</li>
      <li>Let cool and chop</li>
      <li>If using canned tomatillos, they can be chopped and added directly to the mix</li>
      <li>I prefer the slightly sharper taste of fresh ones if you can get them..</li>
      <li>Combine avocados, chopped tomatillos, habaneros and garlic in a food processor and mix well</li>
      <li>Add lime juice and blend until desired consistency is reached</li>
      <li>Add salt, taste and adjust if necessary</li>
      <li>Depending on the ripeness of the avocados, the juiciness of the tomatillos, and the amount of lime juice added, this sauce can vary from chunky and pale green to quite runny and dark green</li>
      <li>It's very good on top of hearty fish like swordfish or tuna, and it's great with chicken, but I've also made it alone as a dip for parties</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>6 ounces Chicos</li>
      <li>2 cups Dried pinto beans</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large Yellow onion; peeled, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic; chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 Red chile pod; seeded, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Lean pork; cubed into 1/4" pieces</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Chicos are a wonderful and very rich cornproduct</li>
      <li>They consist of a rich sweet corn that is sun- or kiln-dried and then removed from the cob</li>
      <li>They are a basic treat in the diet of the Southwest Indians, and I have come to just love the stuff</li>
      <li>The use of corn and beans together should certainly tell you that this dish is legitimate</li>
      <li>Remember the East Coast Indians made a similar dish called Misacquetash or succotash</li>
      <li>This dish is much better</li>
      <li>You will find chicos in any Mexican or Latin American market</li>
      <li>They come in little 6-ounce bags and appear to be expensive, but you must remember that they swell up more than rice</li>
      <li>They are rich in flavor and great in food value</li>
      <li>If you cannot find them in your area it is worth sending away for them</li>
      <li>Soak the chicos and beans together in ample water overnight</li>
      <li>Put the oil in a medium-hot frying pan and saute the onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes until the onion is transparent</li>
      <li>Remove from the pan and place in a 2-quart covered saucepan</li>
      <li>Saute the pork in the same frying pan just until the meat begins to brown</li>
      <li>Drain the chicos and beans and all of the ingredients to the saucepan and then add enough water to just barely cover</li>
      <li>Add salt to taste and simmer, covered, until the beans and chicos are tender, about l hour</li>
      <li>This is a very rich dish</li>
      <li>It can be served as a side dish or as a main course</li>
      <li>Add a vegetable dish and you have a complete meal</li>
      <li>NOTE: Bacon can be substituted for the pork and the dish is very good that way</li>
      <li>Use about 6 thick slices</li>

      <li>Allow grain to sit for the time specified</li>
      <li>Curtis Jackson, cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com I've just discovered, thanks to an old cookbook, a faster way to cook beans, with very good results</li>
      <li>The method is to drop the beans into boiling water sufficiently slowly that the water never stops boiling</li>
      <li>The rational, according to the cookbook, is that the sudden heat ruptures the bean's hull</li>
      <li>Hot water can then easily penetrate and cook the bean</li>
      <li>No pre-soaking is required</li>
      <li>The cookbook also suggests that after getting all the beans in the water, the heat should be turned down to as slow a simmer as possible, because excessive heat causes the proteins in the beans to get tough</li>
      <li>Also, no salt should be added until the beans are cooked, as salt hinders the water from penetrating the bean</li>
      <li>I've tried this with red kidney beans and lima beans, and it worked very well</li>
      <li>They both cooked to perfectly done tenderness in 1 hour, with no pre-soaking.I haven't tried it with harder to cook beans, like soybeans</li>

      <li>Notes: Italian cabbages: Savoy Cabbage and Head Cabbage (Verza e cavolo cappuccio): These belong to the same family as broccoli and cauliflower and are primarily a winter vegetable</li>
      <li>Savoy cabbages have compact heads of wrinkled, curry leaves, dark green on the outside and lighter in the inside</li>
      <li>Head cabbages also have compact heads, but with smooth, light green leaves; they are more delicate in taste than the Savoy</li>
      <li>The leaves of the head cabbage can also be russet or violet in color (known in Italy as cavolonero, Tuscan cabbage or black cabbage)</li>
      <li>Both of them may be eaten raw, cut in thin strips and seasoned with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, or may be stewed or cooked in savory pies and soups</li>
      <li>Substitute savoy cabbage</li>
      <li>If you want the color, try raddichio or red cabbage</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>10 Apples; quartered leave skin on</li>
      <li>12 ounces Cranberries; fresh or frozen</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Cider; sweet</li>
      <li>4 ounces Concentrated OJ; do NOT dilute</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon; more or less</li>
      <li>I use my large CROCKPOT. Combine all ingredients and cook in high stirring</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>occasionally for the first hour or so; covered</li>
      <li>Then remove cover and turn down to low and stir occasionally</li>
      <li>This is a slow process since you have NOT precooked the apples</li>
      <li>Will take 36 or MORE hours</li>
      <li>You may have to use MORE or LESS of the juices depending on the tartness (or sweetness) of the fruit</li>
      <li>You can cook during the night but I usually do not</li>
      <li>I usually put the entire inset in the fridge</li>
      <li>CANNING: You can process this in a water bath but I usually just keep it in the fridge; it never lasts that long</li>
      <li>NOTE: It is the evaporation of the liquid that thickens and sweetens this 'butter'</li>
      <li>After initial cooking with lid; REMOVE lid of the crockpot during the cooking and keep it on LOW! Stir to break up the skin</li>
      <li>You may have to use a hand held blender to get it smooth..or ZAP in the Food Processor</li>

      <li>Milk to glaze</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING 1- APPLE</li>
      <li>1 cup Apple puree; sweetened</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING 2 - CUSTARD</li>
      <li>1 Egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Flour</li>
      <li>150 mililiters Milk; 5/8 cup</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: MarkandSue@highland.cix.co.uk (Mark and Sue Thomas) These are a bit like Danish Pastries but without the yeast dough</li>
      <li>You can use either filling or both together</li>
      <li>Cut pastry into 16 squares, 3" by 3"</li>
      <li>On each square, cut in diagonally from each corner, leaving an area in the centre that is uncut, about 1 inch across</li>
      <li>Put a teaspoonful of either or both fillings in the centre</li>
      <li>Take one corner and fold it to the middle</li>
      <li>Move to the next triangle, and fold in one corner</li>
      <li>Do this for each of the 4 triangles, so you have a pinwheel shape</li>
      <li>Four corners meet in the middle on top of the apple, and 4 are left flat</li>
      <li>This is easier to do than to explain! Use a fish slice to lift onto a greased or lined tray, and paint with milk or egg and milk if you have any</li>
      <li>Bake at 190 C, 375 F for 20 minutes until the points are golden brown</li>
      <li>To make custard: Mix all together and either microwave for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, or cook over a low heat in a saucepan until thickened</li>
      <li>It will taste a bit raw at this stage, but will be fine after baking</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>Grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>Confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the dough: In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute</li>
      <li>Add the sugar and beat until light in color and texture, about 2 minutes</li>
      <li>Beat in the egg and vanilla</li>
      <li>Sift the flour with the salt and baking soda</li>
      <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition</li>
      <li>Scrape the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap tightly</li>
      <li>Refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to roll out, at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight</li>
      <li>To make the filling: Combine the apple butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and walnuts and mix well</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees</li>

      <li>Place a rounded teaspoon of the filling in the center of half of the rounds</li>
      <li>Brush the edges of the rounds lightly with water</li>
      <li>Place the remaining rounds on top of the filled cookies</li>
      <li>Using a fork, press the edges sealed</li>

      <li>Transfer the cookies to ungreased baking sheets</li>
      <li>Bake until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Transfer to wire racks and cool completely</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Sometime last week someone (can't remember who, and I already deleted it....) requested a recipe for some kind of stuffed potato</li>
      <li>I'm not sure if this is what he had in mind, but it's one of our family favorites</li>
      <li>It is the recipe that was used in the restaurant of the Appleton Inns in Massachusetts when my father managed them about ten years ago</li>
      <li>Bake the potatoes at 400 degrees for 40 minutes or until tender (I sometimes "nuke 'em")</li>
      <li>Cut the top quarter off of the potatoes and discard (or do what you will with them!)</li>
      <li>Scrape the potato out of the skin and place in a large bowl</li>
      <li>Place the skins on a baking sheet</li>
      <li>Sliver the bacon and add to the potato in the bowl</li>
      <li>Add the remaining ingredients into the bowl and mix to the desired texture</li>
      <li>Spoon the mixture back into the potato skins, piling high</li>
      <li>Bake at 400 degrees for another 10-15 minutes, until light brown</li>

      <li>Recipe by: Nicki Fritz &lt;FRITZ@QHORSE.STX.COM&gt; I tried (with a few minor modifications) the Apple Pie muffins Marg posted, and they were wonderful! They are the first muffins that actually have the consistency of regular, non-lf muffins</li>
      <li>I did use the cake flour as Marg suggested, but I had tried that in other muffin recipes, and still got that very rubbery consistency that lf-sweet things tend to have</li>
      <li>[nf] Mix wet ingredients, and add dry</li>
      <li>Stir until everything is moistened (these make a very wet batter)</li>
      <li>Spray a muffin pan with Pam, and fill the muffin cups 3/4 full</li>
      <li>Bake at 400 for 15-17 minutes, until a tootpick comes out dry</li>
      <li>This was half of the original recipe, and made 9 average muffins</li>
      <li>If I had a bigger pan, it probably would have made 6 nice-sized muffins</li>
      <li>Each has less than 1 gram of fat per muffin</li>

      <li>From: tamale@aloha.net Date: Wed, 03 Jul 1996 18:52:48 -1000 Around 1977, I was fortunate to take a class at the Los Feliz Jewish Community Center (Los Angeles) with Judy Zeidler, before she became the author of several great books on Jewish cooking</li>
      <li>She was then a columnist with the Los Angeles Times</li>
      <li>She proved how much she enjoyed cooks and cooking -- her sense of fun was so infectious, and we all laughed so hard, that I came home covered with flour, tahine, and apricot-pineapple preserves! I now serve her tasty Apple &amp; Spinach Salad to my family: In a large bowl: Toss apples, onions and celery</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with juice of one lemon to keep apples from darkening</li>
      <li>In a blender or small bowl: Blend mayonnaise, tahini, honey and remaining lemon juice (misture will be thick)</li>
      <li>Toss with apple mixture</li>
      <li>Cover and chill</li>
      <li>Just before serving, toss salad with spinach</li>
      <li>Serve on a bed of spinach leaves and garnish with sesame seeds</li>
      <li>Serves 4 to 6</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: jkirsch@intercable.net (Jacobo Kirsch) Date: Mon, 5 Aug 1996 13:34:40 -0600 My grandmother used to make this incredible Apple Kugl for Rosh Hashana</li>
      <li>She is 91 years old, and this year she is very sick, so for the first time since I was born, she won't be able to cook for us in the Holidays</li>
      <li>She taught me how to bake this kugl, I hope everybody enjoys it the way our family did for many, many years</li>
      <li>I 'd like to share it with all of you as a tribute to such a great woman, who came to Mexico a few days before all her family was murdered in Lithuania</li>
      <li>Mix the ingredients and form a soft dough</li>
      <li>(if you use a Food Procesor, mix the dry ingredients first, and then slowly add the liquids)</li>
      <li>Finish the dough kneadding it with your hands for a few minutes</li>
      <li>Extend the dough with the rolling pin in a big circular shape (aprox</li>
      <li>18 in diameter)</li>
      <li>Spread the circle with plum preserve (maybe 1 or 1 1/2 jars)</li>
      <li>until it is very well covered</li>
      <li>Peel 4 apples and slice them (not very thin, you may use 2 or 3 more apples depending on their size)</li>
      <li>Put the apples over the preserves, sprinkle with sugar, cinamon and a little bit of pepper</li>
      <li>Roll the strudl very carefully, making a tight roll</li>
      <li>Seal the edges with water</li>
      <li>Have ready a deep ovenproof large pot, with boiling oil</li>
      <li>(about 2/3 cup)</li>
      <li>Very carefully place the kugl in the oil rolling it (to make it fit in the pot)</li>
      <li>Cover the kugl with boiling water</li>
      <li>(yes, water, it won't mess up the dough)</li>
      <li>Then cover the pot with foil, and put it in the oven for 2 hours at 400 degrees</li>
      <li>Uncover the pot and let it brown a little</li>
      <li>Serving: Unmold the kugl, and slice it like a cake</li>
      <li>Don't worry the slices won't come out perfect, but the flavor will</li>
      <li>It sounds difficult, but it's not, and it's worthwhile</li>
      <li>I hope everybody tries before Rosh Hashana so you'll be a pro for the Holydays</li>

      <li>Drain the liquid into a large, heavy saucepan and chop the apricots coarsely</li>
      <li>Add the apricots, raisins, lemon juice and rind, and orange juice to the pan, place over low heat, and bring to a simmer</li>

      <li>Add the sugar and continue cooking, stirring frequently until the mixture of fruit is very soft and the syrup sheets when dropped from the side of a spoon (220 degrees on a candy thermometer), 15 to 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Spoon the jam into sterilized half-pint jars</li>
      <li>Seal the jars, process in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes and cool</li>

    <title>Apple Tarte Tatin</title>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 large Firm; sweet apples (such as Winesap, Golden Delicious or Matsu), peeled and halved (6 to 8)</li>
      <li>1 Lemons; halved (1 to 2)</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Unsalted</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Puff pastry</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Apples are most bountiful during the fall, and there's no better way to impress your family or dinner guests than with a freshly baked Apple Tarte Tatin, a simple and elegant dessert created by two sisters from the Loire Valley who earned their living making what the French call "tarte des demoiselles Tatin, or "the tart of two unmarried women named Tatin." This famous French upside-down apple tart is made by covering the bottom of a shallow baking dish with butter and sugar, then a layer of apples and finally a pastry crust</li>
      <li>while baking, the sugar and butter turn into a delicious caramel that becomes the topping when the tart is inverted onto a serving plate</li>
      <li>Choose firm apples that won't soften while baking, like Northern Spy, Winesap or Granny Smith</li>
      <li>You can save time and add richness to the tart by using a store-bought puff pastry, instead of making p‰te brisŽe or p‰te sucrŽe</li>
      <li>Whichever pastry you use, make sure to keep it well-chilled</li>
      <li>Martha Stewart likes to make this tart in a cast iron skillet because it helps the fruit to caramelize, but any heavy-duty nonstick pan with a heat-proof handle will do</li>
      <li>Tarte Tatin can be made in advance and left in the pan; simply rewarm it on the stove over low heat to loosen the caramel, making it easy to remove from the pan</li>
      <li>For a change, try making this dessert with peaches or pears, and don't forget to serve it with a dollop of freshly whipped cream, cr�me fra”che or vanilla ice cream</li>
      <li>It's a dessert your family and friends will remember forever</li>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>Heat oven to 400¡</li>
      <li>Core apples using a melon baller to retain the rounded shape of the apples</li>
      <li>Rub apples with sliced lemons to prevent browning</li>
      <li>Set aside</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>Over medium heat in a 10-inch cast iron skillet, heat sugar and water</li>
      <li>Cook until it turns a rich golden color; swirling occasionally, about 6 to 7 minutes</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, roll puff pastry in one direction out into a 14-inch circle on a lightly floured surface, about 1/8-inch thick</li>
      <li>Brush off any excess flour with a pastry brush</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Add butter to skillet</li>
      <li>Once melted, add the apples; rounded sides down</li>
      <li>Adding as many as possible</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and top apples with puff pastry</li>
      <li>Fold edges under and crimp slightly</li>
      <li>Make 2 to 3 small cuts in the puff pastry to allow the steam to escape</li>
      <li>Place in oven for 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to 375¡ and bake until pastry isgolden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>Remove from oven and Loosen edges with a knife</li>
      <li>Carefully place a plate over the skillet and flip, inverting the Tarte Tatin</li>
      <li>Serve warm or at room temperature</li>

      <li>The original recipe calls for the blanched almonds, but I prefer the taste and texture of walnuts or pecans</li>
      <li>I also recommend using Granny Smith apples, and unsalted margarine can be used in place of vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>Butter is best for the topping</li>

    <title>Apricot-Nut Fruitcake Pt 2/2</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>See part 1</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>full</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours for a 9- or 10- inch tube cake, about 1 hour and 15 minutes for baby loaves, until the cake top(s) aree golden brown (cracking is normal as the steam escapes) and a cake tester inserted in the center shows no visible raw batter</li>
      <li>Cool each cake on a wire rack for 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Run a knife blade around the cake sides to loosen, then top with a cardboard cake disk or plate and invert; remove the pan and peel off the paper</li>
      <li>Invert again and cool the cake completely, right side up</li>
      <li>Once cold, the cakes may be served or stored</li>
      <li>If you wish, wrap the cold cakes in plastic wrap, then in foil, and refrigerate them for a week or two for the flavors to mellow, then serve or freeze</li>
      <li>Do not wrap this cake with alcohol-soaked cloths for storage</li>
      <li>Of course, it is also fine to eat the cake right after baking</li>
      <li>Before serving, brush the cake top with Apricot Glaze or Icing Glaze and set a few halved nuts and cut pieces of apricot into the soft glaze</li>
      <li>Allow about 30 minutes for the glaze to set</li>
      <li>Apricot Glaze: Stir preserves over medium heat in a small saucepan until melted</li>
      <li>Stir and cook about 2 minutes longer, bringing preserves to a boil</li>
      <li>Cook until thick enough to coat a spoon</li>
      <li>Strain preserves through a sieve</li>
      <li>Cool slightly and use pastry brush to coat the cake with lukewarm glaze</li>
      <li>Chill cake to set the glaze</li>
      <li>Firm Apricot Glaze: This recipe is preferred when a glazed cake top must be held several hours before serving</li>
      <li>The addition of gelatin keeps the glaze from melting</li>
      <li>Stir preserves over medium heat in a small saucepan until melted</li>
      <li>Strain preserves through sieve</li>
      <li>Remove solids, then return strained preserves to saucepan</li>
      <li>Add gelatin and liqueur</li>
      <li>Stir over medium heat until gelatin completely dissolves</li>
      <li>Bring to a boil for barely 30 seconds, then cool slightly</li>
      <li>Apply lukewarm glaze to cake</li>
      <li>Chill cake to set glaze</li>
      <li>Basic Icing Glaze: Enough for one 9-inch tube cake</li>
      <li>Double recipe for 10-inch tube cake</li>
      <li>Combine all ingredients in a small bowl, beat well, and check flavor and consistency</li>
      <li>Add more cream to thin, more sifted sugar to thicken the glaze</li>
      <li>It should drip from a spatula in a sheet when at correct consistency</li>
      <li>Recipe is from _A Piece of Cake_ by Susan G</li>

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>2 cups Peeled apples; diced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Chopped pecans</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar; or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 Sheets frozen puff pastry; thawed and chilled</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
      <li>Confectioner's sugar; for dusting</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Plump the raisins in boiling water to cover while you prepare the apples</li>
      <li>Combine the apples, nuts, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon in a bowl and toss well</li>
      <li>Drain the plumped fruit, stir it in with the other ingredients, and let their flavors marry while you prepare the pastry</li>
      <li>On a lightly floured board, one at a time, roll the pastry sheets out to approximately 12 inches square</li>
      <li>Trim the outer edges (this is essential for the puff pastry) and cut each sheet into four 6-inch squares, making eight in all</li>
      <li>Place a generous 1/3 cup of fruit filling just off center in each square</li>
      <li>Moisten the edges of two adjacent sides, fold the opposite sides over, and press to seal</li>
      <li>Crimp the edges closed with the tines of a fork</li>
      <li>Repeat with the remaining turnovers and chill thoroughly</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees</li>
      <li>Beat together the egg and water and brush lightly on top of the turnover without letting the egg wash drip down the cut sides</li>
      <li>Place the turnovers on cookie sheets (for puff pastry, spread a little cold water on the sheets but do not grease; for flaky pie pastry, grease the sheets)</li>
      <li>Bake until they are puffed and golden, about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Serve them warm or at room temperature dusted, if you like, with confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>NOTES : Turnovers can be made in squares or circles of any size and filled with any fruit alone or in combination, savory as well as sweet</li>
      <li>They are a fine way to use up leftover bits of this and that, including pastry, and their handy self-packaging makes them excellent picnic fare</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Emily Hirsch &lt;emilyh@dex.com&gt; Date: 16 Sep 1995 08:09:38 -0600 A while ago, I added apricot butter to my usual banana nut bread</li>
      <li>I also used apricot jam - the chunks of apricot in the jam added a nice texture</li>
      <li>The results were great! Best to have all ingredients at room temperature</li>
      <li>Cream butter and sugar</li>
      <li>Add egg, lemon zest, banana and apricot butter</li>
      <li>Sift flour and baking powder together</li>
      <li>Fold flour mixture gradually into the wet ingredients</li>
      <li>Mix in walnuts</li>
      <li>Pour batter into a bread pan, and bake for about 1 hour at 350 degrees Farenheit</li>
      <li>P.S</li>
      <li>Apricot butter also makes a nice glaze for pork roast or ham</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>A day or two before baking the cake, combine all the dried fruits and nuts in a large bowl and toss well with the rum or Calvados and cider</li>
      <li>Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place for at least 24 hours</li>
      <li>Toss the mixture occasionally</li>
      <li>2</li>
      <li>On the baking day, prepare pans</li>
      <li>Use one tube pan 10 x 4 inches or one 9 1/4-inch tube pan (9 cup capacity) plus 2 baby loaf pans, each 6 x 3 1/2 x 2 inches, or the equivalent in capacity (cake consists of about 12 cups batter.) Lightly grease pan(s), cut paper liners to cover both bottom and sides, press paper in place, then grease paper</li>
      <li>Position rack in center of oven for 1 large cake, or divide oven in thirds for several cakes</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 F (165 C)</li>
      <li>3</li>
      <li>Sift both flours, the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices together onto wax paper</li>
      <li>Set aside</li>
      <li>To make the cake batter, use a spoon and a mixing bowl or the electric mixer to cream together the butter and sugar until well blended</li>
      <li>Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition</li>
      <li>Stir in vanilla</li>
      <li>Add the flour mixture in 3 or 4 additions, beating very slowly to blend after each addition</li>
      <li>The batter will be quite stiff</li>
      <li>Stir in the grated apple and applesauce</li>
      <li>Stir the macerated fruit-nut-rum mixture, then add it to the batter along with all the liquid</li>
      <li>Stir the batter with a sturdy wooden spoon until well blended; really the best way to blend is with your bare hands</li>
      <li>4</li>
      <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared pan(s), filling them about 2/3 continued in part 2</li>

    <title>Apricot Almond Meringue Cookies</title>
    <category>Cookies</category>
    <quantity>48</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 large Egg whites; at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt; or cream of tartar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar; superfine</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 ounces Dried apricots; finely diced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Slivered almonds; lightly toasted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees</li>
      <li>Lightly grease two cookie sheets or, if you prefer, grease parchment or waxed paper spread on cookie sheets</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt or cream of tartar until the whites make soft peaks</li>
      <li>To make a tender meringue, gradually add all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar as you continue to beat</li>
      <li>Check to see if the sugar has dissolved by pinching the meringue</li>
      <li>When you can no longer feel the crystals, fold in the remaining sugar, then the vanilla extract, and finally the apricots and almonds</li>
      <li>Drop neat spoonfuls of the meringue batter onto the cookie sheets; give them attractive peaks, as they will not spread or change their shape</li>
      <li>Bake for 1hour without opening the door</li>
      <li>Turn off the oven and keep them in the unopened oven for at least another hour or as long as overnight</li>
      <li>Remove the cookies with a spatula</li>
      <li>Store them in airtight tins or, closed tightly in a plastic bag, in the freezer, where they will keep indefinitely</li>
      <li>NOTES : These light, tender meringue cookies are a good way to use up extra egg whites</li>

    <category>Dough cycle</category>
    <quantity>15</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/8 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Orange extract; optional</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Malt powder; or honey / sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>3 1/3 cups Bread flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Wheat gluten; optional</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Yeast</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Dried apricots; diced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place ingredients in the bread machine in the order listed</li>
      <li>Use the dough setting</li>
      <li>Add the apricots 5 minutes before the end of the kneading phase or work into the dough before shaping</li>
      <li>If you don't have a dough setting stop the machine after the rises</li>
      <li>Prepare the baking sheets or use nonstick sheets</li>
      <li>Remove dough from the machine, punch it down, and roll it out into a rectangle about 14 x 18</li>
      <li>Divide into equal pieces and shape into bagel form or use a cutter</li>
      <li>Place the bagels on the sheets and let them rise again</li>
      <li>I put them in the oven to provide a draft free location</li>
      <li>This rise can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours depending on what else is going on in your life</li>
      <li>Fill a 4 to 6 qt soup pot with water 3 to 4 " deep</li>
      <li>You can add 2 T of malt syrup, honey, sugar or non-diastatic malt powder</li>
      <li>Get the water to boiling</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400</li>
      <li>Drop the bagels one at a time into the boiling water</li>
      <li>Boil only 3 or 4 at a time so they don't crowd</li>
      <li>Simmer each side for a minute and return to the baking sheet</li>
      <li>Add glazes or toppings as desired</li>
      <li>Bake just below the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven</li>
      <li>The book calls for 20 to 25 minutes</li>
      <li>I usually start at 15 minutes for the 1st sheet and less for the second</li>
      <li>These are best eaten while they are still warm</li>
      <li>They can be frozen - you may want to slice them first so you can defost them in the toaster</li>
      <li>Serving Ideas : for peach bagels sub dried peaches for the apricots NOTES : I use orange oil instead of the orange extract</li>
      <li>These are really excellent</li>

    <category>Fruits</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Dried apricots</li>
      <li>1 quart Hot water</li>
      <li>10 large Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 large Onion -- chopped fine</li>
      <li>1 3" piece of fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Vinegar -- (see Note at</li>
      <li>Bottom)</li>
      <li>1 pound Sugar -- (see Note at</li>
      <li>Bottom)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt -- I use at least 1</li>
      <li>Tsp</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cayenne</li>
      <li>1 cup Raisins</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes 5 lbs</li>
      <li>Rinse and put the apricots in a bowl with the hot water (I add the juice of 1 lemon and the cut up lemon peel) Leave to soak for 4 hours</li>
      <li>Chop the garlic</li>
      <li>Peel and chop the ginger</li>
      <li>Blend the garlic and ginger with a little of the vinegar until smooth</li>
      <li>Put the apricots with their soakings water, the onions, the ginger and garlic mixture into an preserving kettle with the rest of the vinegar</li>
      <li>Add the sugar, salt and cayenne</li>
      <li>Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning</li>
      <li>Add the raisins and continue cooking until the chutney thickens and begins to turn shiny</li>
      <li>Pack into hot clean jars, cover, process and cool</li>
      <li>--Note : I use brown sugar and regular raisins for a dark chutney - I use white sugar and golden raisins for a golden chutney</li>
      <li>I don't blend the garlic and ginger mixture - I simply mince very small or put through a garlic press</li>
      <li>You can substitute dried ginger for fresh ginger</li>
      <li>Chutney is not supposed to require a hot water bath, because of the acid level from the vinegar - but I give it a hot water bath anyway</li>
      <li>You can use apple cider vinegar in this recipe</li>
      <li>I use a gas cooktop - and I cook the simmer the mixture with a simmer plate between the pot and the burners</li>
      <li>Be sure you use a heavy bottomed pan - to prevent scorching or burning</li>
      <li>PS: I always refrigerate the Chutney after opening the jar</li>
      <li>"Sweet chutneys provide a delicious finishing touch to cold cuts, cheese and salads</li>
      <li>This slightly hot, spicy way of dealing with dried apricots and raisins is an original and ever popular addition to cold, simple fare?
