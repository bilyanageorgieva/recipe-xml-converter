    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Lemon juice, fresh</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>6 medium Artichoke</li>
      <li>1 cup Olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Onion; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Dill, fresh or 1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>;dried dill weed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large, deep bowl, beat the lemon juice and flour together with a whisk or spoon, add the water and beat to a smooth thin paste. Set aside. With a small, sharp knife, trim 1/8 inch off the stem end of each artichoke and peel the tough outer skin from the remaining stem. Snap off the small bottom leaves and any bruised or discolored outer leaves. Lay each artichoke on its side, grip it firmly, and with a large knife slice about 1 inch off the top. Spread the top leaves apart gently and pull out the inner core of thistle like yellow leaves. With a long handled spoon, scrape out the hair choke inside. Drop the artichokes into the lemon juice mixture, turning them about to coat them evenly and let them soak while you make the sauce. Heat the olive oil over moderate heat in a shallow enameled or stainless steel casserole large enough to hold the artichokes comfortably. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, or until they are soft and transparent but not brown. Drain the artichoke soaking liquid into the casserole, add the dill and salt and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil over high heat. Lay the artichokes side by side in the sauce and baste them thoroughly. Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer for 20 minutes. Then turn the artichokes over and, basting occasionally, simmer 25 minutes longer, or until their bases show no resistance when pierced with the pint of a small knife. Remove from the heat and let the artichokes cool to room temperature. To serve, arrange on a platter and spoon the sauce over them.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>toss the 2 peppers whole into a broiler/toaster oven or regular oven at 375 degrees for 20 min., turning every 5 min to make sure all sides are slightly charred. Remove and plunge into ice water, which will shrivel the peppers and allow you to peel the skin off in a breeze. After peeled, seed and coarsely chop the peppers. While the peppers are roasting, water-fry the onion and garlic til they give up (just translucent :-) when done, toss into a food processor and process a few seconds. Add the peppers, lemon juice, and seasonings to the processor and puree til slightly smooth (we used a bit of rice milk to thin it down a bit). Seve immedaitely (it will still be warm) over the pasta. Posted to fatfree digest V98 #004 by Bloodroses@webtv.net (Audney R. Terry\) (string bean) on Jan 4, 1998</li>

      <li>1 Box (small) sugar free Jello white chocolate pudding mix</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is an angle food based desert that we have had at the end of our aerobics session. So we KNOW it can't be fattening, right? Mix the pudding with the milk, then mix in the sour cream. Fold in Cool Whip. Place 1/2 of the angel food chunks in the bottom of a bowl. Cover with 1/2 of the sliced strawberries. Cover strawberries with 1/2 pudding mix. Repeat with cake chunks, balance of strawberries and rest of pudding mix. Refrigerate for a couple of hours before serving. It is really good and I ate the whole bowl myself (over a weekend, that is.) Posted to TNT - Prodigy's Recipe Exchange Newsletter by babbs2@juno.com on Jul 21, 1997</li>

    <title>Angel Hair with Balsamic Tomatoes</title>

    <category>Pasta</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 teaspoon Minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>5 To 6 Roma tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Balsamic vinegar</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Angel hair pasta; (uncooked)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Saute the garlic in olive oil until lightly browned. Do this in a skillet large enough to hold the tomatoes later. Leave garlic in skillet. Place tomatoes, salt &amp; pepper, basil and balsamic vinegar in a non-reactive bowl and set aside for 10 minutes, stirring occassionally. Boil water for pasta. Just before you put the pasta in the water, drain tomatoes and reserve the juice that runs off. (I usually set my colander on a dinner plate). Put the angel hair pasta in the water to cook for the recommended amount of time. Heat your garlic skillet and toss drained tomatoes briefly JUST to heat. They should retain their shape. The pasta should finish cooking (usually no more than 5 min. for angel hair) at the same time the tomatoes are ready. Toss the pasta and tomato mixture together and serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese Posted to FOODWINE Digest 13 Sep 96 Date: Sat, 14 Sep 1996 11:27:40 -0400 From: Eileen &amp; Bob Holze &lt;beck4@ASAN.COM&gt;</li>

    <ingredient>

      <li>3 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped shallots</li>
      <li>3/4 pounds Fresh mushrooms, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 pints (1 cup) whipping cream</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Angel hair pasta</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>pinches Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the porcini in a small bowl and and 1/2 cup warm water. Allow to soak 45 minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid. Heat a large frying pan. Add the oil and shallots, and saute a minute. Add the fresh mushrooms and saute until tender. Chop the porcini coarsely and add to the frying pan, along with the reserved liquid. Simmer until most of the liquid is evaporated. Bring a large pot of water to a boil along with a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Refrigerate the whipped cream until the pasta is cooked. Cook the pasta in the boiling water until al dente. Drain well, return the drained pasta to the pot and add the mushroom mixture, cheese, whipped cream and salt and pepper to taste. Using a large spatula, fold all of the ingredients together. Do this quickly, yet carefully, so that the whipped cream doesn't collapse entirely. You may want to save a bit of the whipped cream to dollop on top of the pasta as a garnish. Serve immediately. * Or other dried mushrooms Source: Frugal Gourmet Celebrates Christmas Typed by Dale/Gail Shipp File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip</li>

      <li>From: SusanC2552@aol.com Date: Sat, 23 Mar 1996 14:00:19 -0500 Recipe By: Great American Home Baking 1. To prepare filling, in a medium saucepan, mix together berries, sugar, liqueur, and lemon peel. 2. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until berries are soft and sugar has dissolved, 5 to 8 min. (Do not overcook.) Let cool. 3. Using a serrated knife, trim cake of any browned edges. Cut cake into 1/2 inch slices; cut slices into triangles. 4. Tightly line the bottom and sides of a 1 1/2 to 2 quart bowl or souffle dish with three-quarters of the cake. If necessary, fill any gaps with small pieces of cake. 5. Spoon filling into the cake-lined bowl. Top with remaining cake triangles, covering berries completely. 6. Place a plate, just slightly smaller than the bowl's diameter, on top of pudding. Weigh down saucer with a 4 or 5 pound can. Chill for 8 hours or overnight. 7. Remove plate and can. Carefully unmold pudding onto a serving plate. 8. To prepare topping, beat cream at medium speed until soft peaks form. Beat in confectioners' sugar. 9. Spoon cream mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip; pipe small mounds of cream mixture on top of pudding. Garnish with fresh berries and sprigs of fresh mint. NOTES : Sinfully delicious, this puding just gets better as it sits (which is never very long). You can substitue frozen berries for fresh ones.

      <li>NOTE No one ever made a better angel food cake, than my Mom! It was a favorite company dessert, often served with fresh fruit and whipped cream. Onolicious!! She followed the directions in her cookbook *exactly*. Me ke aloha, Mary Spero Here is what her favorite cookbook says about angel food cakes: "True sponge cake is leavened solely by air beaten into eggs. White sponge cake, or angel food, is made with only whites of eggs. Mock sponge cakes are made with baking powder and fewer eggs. Sift flour several times to incorporate as much air as possible. Handle flour lightly. Beat the egg whites until they are just stiff enough to hold up in peaks. The white piles should look moist and glossy. Eggs beaten just to this peaked, glossy stage give the best volume and finest grain. More air can be enclosed in egg whites if you beat them with a flat wire whisk instead of a rotary beater. Underbeaten egg whites makes cake heavy, compact, and undersized because not enough air has been incorporated. Overbeaten whites make dry cake of poor volume because of loss of air and moisture. Add flavoring to the mixture before the flour. It will then be thoroughly blended without the extra folding that would be necessary if it were added last. In combining ingredients, use only the folding motion. (See paragraph 29.) ** Fold mixture just enough to blend ingredients. Undermixing makes uneven grain in cake. Overmixing makes the cake heavy, undersized, close-grained, and tough. Spread batter evenly in ungreased pan. Cut spatula through batter with a circular motion to remove any large air bubbles and to draw batter into unfilled spaces." ** FOLDING is the motion made by gently cutting down through the mixture - and curving up and over. This encloses more air and prevents the escape of that already beaten into the eggs. Down, up, and over - down, up, and over ~ that is the folding motion. It should become a deft, rolling, continuous motion so that no time is lost. Use this motion to combine mixtures that contain important amounts of air.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 small Fresh globe artichokes</li>
      <li>1 1/2 ounces Tarama; rinsed if necessary =OR=- Smoked skinned cod's roe</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Finely grated onion pulp</li>
      <li>2 large Juicy lemons</li>
      <li>1 cup Fruity olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground white pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To clean the artichokes, cut off the stems flush with the base, remove any tough, unsightly outer leaves and cut off the top one-third of the flower bud itself. Force the leaves open a little, and rinse under cold water, with a squeeze of lemon or a splash of vinegar to prevent discoloring. Place the artichokes upside-down in a pot large enough to hold them all in one layer and pour in boiling water to come one-fourth of the way up the sides. Salt and simmer 15-40 minutes, depending on their age and size - until the heart is just tender when pricked with a fork. Drain and refresh them under cold water; drain again and chill. Beat the tarama or smoked cod's roe with the grated onion. You can do this easily in a food processor. Finely grate the zest of one lemon and beat in, with 2 teaspoons boiling water. Squeeze the juice of both lemons. Alternately dribble in lemon juice and olive oil, beating each addition in before adding the next, as though making mayonnaise - it may not need all the oil. If you are doing this by hand, it take perseverence and elbow grease to make it nice and light. Taste and season with pepper. Open the artichokes and remove the inner, soft leaves and then the hairy choke. Spoon tarama into the cup of leaves.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 can (large) of crushed pineapple</li>
      <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Crushed walnuts (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Bake or Purchase an Angel Food Cake and slice it twice to make three layers. Pour on top of each layer the following pineapple sauce. Stir ingredients in pan over stove until bubbly. If not thick enough you can add a small amount apx 1 tsp corn starch (or flour) in 1/8 cup of water stir together and add to pineapple mixture, heat alittle longer while stiring. Cool and layer onto cake. Frosting: Whipped cream with 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla (OR Cool whip) Mix with your favorite JAM (I use raspberry) approximately 1/2 cup. I actually top each layer and the entire cake with mounds of this cream mixture. Imagination is great on holidays for this cake. Different filing mixtures, and different jams for color. Top with coconut and jelly beans for easter. Use peppermint candies for xmas It's a fun cake to decorate. I have also used a box of jello instead of Jam for the frosting. Obviously lemon for yellow frosting raspberry for red and lime for green. Posted to TNT - Prodigy's Recipe Exchange Newsletter by "Peggy L.

      <li>Chopped dill for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Serves: 4 as a light meal, 8 as a first course Cooking time: 45-50 minutes Wash artichokes well and cut off stem close to base. Have ready a bowl of cold water with the juice of 1 lemon and some lemon slices added. If desired stir in 2-3 tablespoons flour as this is quite effective in preventing discoloration. As each artichoke is prepared, rub cut surfaces with a lemon slice from the bowl and place in bowl until all are prepared. Cook as soon as possible after preparation. Remove 3 or 4 layers of leaves until the tender inner leaves remain. Scoop out choke and pink thorny leaves from centre, using a spoon or melon ball scoop. Cut in half. In a large pan gently fry spring onion in oil until soft. Add juice of 1/2 lemon, water, about 2 teaspoons salt and a good grinding of pepper. Bring to the boil. Drain prepared artichokes and add to pan with dill. Return to a slow simmer, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes or until artichokes are tender. Stain cooking liquid into a pan and boil until reduced to half original quantity (about 1-1/2 cups). Keep artichokes hot in a slow oven. Mix cornflour to a paste with a little cold water and stir into simmering liquid. Stir until thickened and bubbling and leave to simmer gently. Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until light and frothy and gradually add remaining lemon juice. Gradually pour in simmering stock, beating constantly. Return to pan and stir over low heat for a minute or 2 to cook the egg. Pile artichokes on a warm platter, pour sauce on top and sprinkle with chopped dill. Serve as a light meal or as a first course. From: "The Complete Middle East Cookbook" by Tess Mallos.

      <li>Ingredient Group: BARB DAY</li>
      <li>1 cup Cake Flour;sifted</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Sugar; granulated/sifted</li>
      <li>1 cup Egg whites</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cream of tartar</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Almond extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sift flour once, measure, add 1/4 cup sugar, and sift together four times. Beat egg whites and salt with rotary egg beater or flat wire whisk. When foamy, add cream of tartar and continue beating until eggs are stiff enough to hold up in peaks, but not dry. Add remaining I cup sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating with rotary egg beater or whisk after each addition until sugar is just blended. Fold in flavoring. Then sift about 1/4 cup flour over mixture and fold in lightly; repeat until all is used. Turn into ungreased angel food pan. Cut gently through batter with knife to remove air bubbles. Bake in slow oven (325 degrees F) 45 to 50 minutes Remove from oven and invert pan 1 hour, or until cold. Spread Raspberry Icing thinly on top and sides of cake. Angel Food Cake is often served plain or sprinkled lightly with confectioners'sugar. For Large Angel Food Cake, use above recipe, increasing sugar and egg whites to 1 1/2 cups each. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar to flour and 1 1/4 cups to egg whites. Bake in slow oven (325 degrees F) 1 hour. Note: Remove eggs from refrigerator several hours be- fore using. They beat up lighter and more easily when at room temperature, and give increased fineness of grain and delicacy of texture to angel food cakes.

    <quantity>5</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Angel Hair or Capellini uncooked</li>
      <li>2 Red bell peppers; OR... Red bell peeper -AND- Yellow bell pepper</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Finely shredded fresh basil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Balsamic vinegar OR fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove; minced</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>Pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>8 ounces Boneless chicken breasts (without skin), cut into small cubes</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chicken broth</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Roast and peel the peppers as follows: Place the peppers directly over a gas jet of the range (or under a pre-heated broiler), turning them often with a pair of tongs, until blackened on all sides. Transfer them to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let them stand until cool. Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and remove the stems and seeds. Scrape off the blackened skin of the pepper. Cut the peppers into 1/4-inch pieces. Toss the diced roasted peppers with the basil, balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. (This salsa may be prepared and refrigerated up to one day in advance.) Prepare pasta according to package directions. While pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and stir until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Add the roasted pepper salsa and stir 30 seconds, scraping up the brown bits that stick to the pan. Remove the skillet from the heat. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water. Add the water and the chicken broth to the skillet with the chicken mixture. Return the pasta to the pot. When the chicken is cooked through, transfer the contents of the skillet to the pot and heat over high heat until the sauce is boiling and reduced enough to lightly coat the pasta. Season to taste.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pint Milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Leeks</li>
      <li>8 Free Range Eggs, Size 2</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Heaped, Cornflour</li>
      <li>1 ounce Butter</li>
      <li>pinches Nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 ounces Grated Caerphilly Cheese or cheddar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim the leeks and wash them thoroughly. Cut into 1 inch lengths. Put the milk ( or milk / cream mixture) into a non-stick saucepan with the leeks and bring to the boil. If you like your leeks soft rather than slightly crisp, let them boil for a minute or two. Remove the leeks (leaving the milk in the pan) and put them into a baking dish. Put the eggs cold into boiling water and cook for exactly five minutes. Remove, cool and shell. The eggs should be soft in the middle but the whites will be firm. Lay the shelled eggs on the leeks. Make a white sauce by whisking in the cornflour, salt and butter and bring gently to the boil while you whisk. When the sauce is smooth, thick and glossy, pour it over the eggs and leeks, sprinkle the top with nutmeg and grated cheese and put it under the grill until it is hot and bubbling. Don't leave it too long or the eggs will be over-cooked. Serve at once with lots of crusty bread and butter From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Sun, 3 Mar 96 08:42:45 PST From: eboyd@shentel.net Sift the flour, sugar, and salt together 3 times. Beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar, slowly at first, then increasing the speed. When the whites are quite frothy, slowly sift in the sugar, beating hard, until firm peaks form. Slowly sift the flour over the whites. Turn into the ungreased tube pan and bake in an oven preheated to 325 for about 50 minutes, until the cake browns well and is slightly resistant to the touch. Cool inverted over a rack. Loosen sides and bottom, if necessary, with a thin knife or spatula to free the cake. Serve at room temperature. SNOWBALLS:Tear an Angel Food Cake (above) into balls about the size of an egg using 2 forks. Coat each ball with whipped cream and roll in freshly grated coconut. Chill well before serving. This very old and clever use of leftover or slightly stale cake is generally adored by children, especially in the heat of summer. Often it is served at birthday parties with a candle in each serving, a play on fire and ice. CHOCOLATE ANGEL FOOD CAKE--15-18 servings: Make the Angel Food Cake (above) recipe, but in place of 1 cup flour, use 3/4 cup flour and 1/3 cup cocoa. Sift flour and cocoa together 3 times. Proceed as for regular Angel Food Cake. When cool and turned out, split twice for 3 layers. Ice between layers and over outside with Two Whiskey Chocolate Mousse (see recipe).

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 large Cooking apples (Yellow Delicious, or Granny Smith)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Nutmeg, grated</li>
      <li>Confectioners sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 475. Peel, core and very thinly slice the apples: you should have approximately 1-1/2 cups. Melt 3 T sp. of the butter over medium low heat in a small fry pan, and saute the apples until they are just tender. Keep apples warm while preparing the batter. Place a 9 or 10 inch cast-iron skillet in the oven to heat for at least 5 minutes--the pan has to be very hot for this to work. When it is well heated, add the remaining 2 T sp. of butter to melt and put the skillet back in the oven; the butter should be very hot buy not brown when you add the apples and the batter. Place the flour, milk, vanilla, salt and nutmeg in a blender and whirl until smooth. Remove the skillet from the oven, quickly arrange the warm apple slices over the melted butter, and pour the batter evenly over all. Bake for 15 min., reduce heat to 375 and bake 10 min longer. The pancake will puff and climb up the sides of the pan. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar, then cut in wedges and serve with maple syrup. Note: If you do not use apples, add 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter to the hot skillet.

      <li>Root</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 To 2 Tbsp hot bean paste</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Pour the boiling water over the TVP and let it sit for 10 minutes. Saute the gingerroot in a very small anount of oil or other liquid. Add the soy sauce, bean paste, salt and TVP. Cook very very gently and stir frequently as it burns easily. Cook about 5 minutes and set aside. Cook the bean threads in the broth until the broth has been absorbed by the noodles. Add the noodles to the TVP mixture and stir until blended evenly...ie. all the "ants" are distributed throughout. Enjoy! Source: This is a dish that was a favorite at our local Chineses eatery. I used to make it with ground turkey (before I saw the light) and have found that TVP works just as well. It's hot and spicy...delicious and just a little different.

      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: robertp@meaddata.com (Robert Penrod) Date: Mon, 29 Aug 1994 03:42:06 GMT Applesauce: Use tart apples for the applesauce, no sugar when cooking and very little water. It should be as thick as possible (drain off water as it cooks). Use a heavy pan so the applesauce will cook without sticking. Soak the gelatin in 1/2 cup of the applesauce. Bring the rest of the applesauce and the sugar to a boil. After it is boiling, add the applesauce-gelatin mixture and bring back to a slow boil for 15 minutes, stirring almost constantly. Add the walnuts, lemon extract and vanilla. Pour into a buttered pan. Let stand at least 24 hours, then cut into squares and roll in confectioners' sugar. Store in refrigerator. A 8-inch square pan, might make the candy too thick. A 9 by 13-inch pan would probably make it too thin. The mixture should be about 3/4-inch deep, so adjust the pan size. Cotlets: Use 1 cup apricot jam and 1 cup applesauce, cutting sugar to 3 cups. Or use canned unsweetened apricots, drained. Mash well with a potato masher. Use 2 cups mashed apricots and and follow recipe as written. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CANDY From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>1 3-lb chicken; (or favorite pieces)</li>
      <li>1 pint Cream or milk</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>1 Celery with leaves</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; quartered</li>
      <li>1 medium Carrot; peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE DUMPLING DOUGH</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Shortening; that's crisco</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Posted to RFC Preparation Time: 0:30 First, cut the chicken in half. Right down the middle. Makes it easier to cook. In fact, I cut the halves in half. If you want you can just get a couple packages of your favorite chicken parts (more expensive than a whole chicken, however). Wash chicken good under running water. Put chicken into a stewing pot with enough water to cover the chicken about two inches. Bring it to a boil, reduce the heat, and let it simmer until done, about 30 minutes. While it's cooking, every once in a while skim the foam off the top of the water with a spoon and sling it into the sink, then turn the chicken in the pot once in a while. While it's cooking, make the dumplings. Mix flour, salt, shortening. Crumble it in your hands until it looks like flour "bee-bees". Add egg and water and mix it well. Pat it into a big circle, dust it with flour, and roll it out to about 1/8-inch thickness Let it rest 15 minutes. By now the chicken should be done. Remove the onion, celery stalk and carrot pieces &amp; discard. Take it out of the pot and let it cool until you can handle it. Remove the meat from the chicken and discard all the skin, bones and some unknown stuff. Chop the meat into bite-sized pieces. Bring the broth back to a boil. Cut the dumplings into strips about 1-inch wide (I use a pizza cutter to do this). Pick up the strips one at a time and pinch off pieces and drop them into the boiling broth. Every so often, stop and stir to make sure they're not sticking together (I use a wooden spoon to do this). When all the dumplings are in the broth, let the whole thing cook about five more minutes, then test a dumpling to see if it has the texture you want. It should be done by now, but if the dumpling is still raw in the middle, let it all cook a little longer. Finally, add about half-teaspoon of salt and taste to see if it needs more. Now add the cream or milk and dump the chicken back into the bowl and dust it with black pepper. "Okay, Edward, pay attention. You're going to get some posts for dumpling recipes that have BAKING POWDER in them. You're going to IGNORE those, right? You're from Auburn, right? Auburn is the 51st state, right? Auburn was one of the states that seceded from the Union, right? And what's the definition of the Union? "A bunch of states where people put baking powder in flour and call it dumplings." That's the definition of the Union. Well, if it has baking powder in it, it ain't dumplings, it's biscuits, and the dish ain't "chicken 'n dumplin's", it's "Chicken Flavored Number of notes exported: 6 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1056 by "M.

Boil remaining juice with the sugar for 15 minutes to concentrate it. Mix the lemon and lime juice, and add all but 1/4 cup cornstarch to dissolve it in the mixture. Add both gelatin mixture and cornstarch mixture to the boiled juice and boil again rapidly for 10 minutes until very thick, stirring constantly. Taste for sweet and sour and add more lemon juice if wanted. Mix in the walnuts and pour mixture into a 9-by-9-by-2-inch baking pan that has been dipped in cold water. Let paste harden 12 hours or overnight, then cut with a sharp knife into squares. Mix together the reserved 1/4 cup cornstarch and powdered sugar.

      <li>1 tablespoon Oil, sesame, toasted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Iceberg lettuce leaves, 2 or 3 for each person Bone and finely chop the pork. Do not grind this as you want very small pieces to "climb" on the branches of the noodles. Marinate the pork in the soy, wine and ginger for about 15 minutes. Slice the green onions. Finely chop the cabbage and mushrooms, reserving the soaking water from the mushrooms. Heat the oil in a wok until it is just beginning to smoke. Use good ventilation in your kitchen for this one! Open the noodle package and undo them a bit. Drop into the hot fat in small batches. They will immediately puff up into wonderful white crunchy noodles. Turn quickly to be sure that all of them are cooked. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels. Be very careful with this. You could burn yourself. Set the noodles aside. Heat another wok or frying pan and add 1 Tablespoon of the peanut oil. Add the chopped garlic and toss for a moment. Add the meat and marinade and stir fry, mixing it about, until the meat is tender but not dry, about 3 minutes on high heat. Remove the meat mixture and add the vegetables to the wok. Stir fry over high heat for 3 more minutes. Return the meat to the pan and add the hot bean sauce, sugar and black pepper. Stir fry for 1 minute and then add the cornstarch dissolved in the water. Stir until the sauce thickens. If you have too little sauce, add a bit of the water in which you have soaked the mushrooms. Add the sesame oil and stir. Place the fried noodles on a large platter and pour the meat and vegetable mixture over the noodles. Do this carefully so that the little pieces of pork and mushrooms will cling to the "branches". Toss at the table in front of your guests. Each person then takes a bit of noodle and meat sauce and places it in the center of a lettuce leaf. Roll it up like a burrito and enjoy.

    <category>Stews</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Red bell peppers</li>
      <li>5 Green anaheim chiles</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sunflower oil</li>
      <li>1 pound Venison, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 Onion, diced</li>
      <li>3 Garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 Carrots, sliced</li>
      <li>3 cups Cooked Indian hominy</li>
      <li>8 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon White pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup Tumbleweed greens, thoroughly cleaned, or curly endive</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Roast the peppers, then peel, seed, and cut into long strips. Roast the chiles, then peel, seed, devein and dice. Heat the oil in a large stew pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is almost smoking, add the venison and cook until the meat is lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the onion and garlic and saute 2 minutes more. Stir in the carrots, peppers, and chiles and cook 1 minute more. Add the hominy, water, salt, and pepper and bring the mixture ot a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let the stew simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until the meat is very tender. Just before serving, add the tumbleweed greens, stir 1 minute and spoon into bowls. ***** The Apache people lived in many regions throughout southeastern Arizona and New Mexico. The men hunted the animals that roamed the mountains, and the women gathered and harvested both wild foods and the foods that they cultivated on the land. This recipe is based on a traditional stew that was taught to me by a San Carlos medicine man during one of my visits to his ranch. When I prepare the stew now, I can vividly remember the tapping of his traditional water drum and the songs he chanted in his native Apache tongue. Through his songs, he asked for all people to walk in harmony with Mother Earth and be guided by the spirit of the mountains and the spirit of his drum. I still remember the sincerity and yearning of his songs. Depending on what type of produce was available, the ingredients added to the venison varied each time the stew was prepared. This recipe includes the basics of the stew, but you can substitute other vegetables.

    <title>An Absolutely Perfect Roast Goose!</title>
    <category>Info/help</category>
    <category>Alt./birds</category>
    <category>Holidays</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 10 to 12 lb. goose either fresh or frozen and thawed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I have made a Thanksgiving goose every year for at least 15 years. I have steadily gained on making the perfect bird but I finally found the greatest recipe ever in Cook's Magazine. The divine part of this approach to cooking the goose is that it employs some of the eastern method of drying the skin which is used in Peking Duck. The skin simply drops all its fat and leaves a crispy, dry, delectable skin that folks fight over! No more rubbery, yucky goose skin full of fat! A frozen goose is perfectly adequate. Have thawed 24 to 48 hours before the meal (48 is better.) Prick the goose well all over, especially on the breast and on the upper legs, holding the skewer almost paralel with the bird so as to avoid piercing the flesh. Fill a very large pot 2/3 full of water (pot should be large enough to almost accomodate the bird) and bring to a boil. Using rubber gloves submerge bird (neck side down) for 1 minute (till goose bumps arise.) Repeat the process (this time with the tail side down.) Drain the goose, breast side up on a rack in a large roasting pan and set in the refrigerator, naked, to dry the skin for 24 to 48 hours. When you are ready to roast the bird, on the big day. Make your favorite stuffing. I made one in "94" that seemed to be well liked. The night before Thanksgiving I cooked 1 1/2 cups (raw) wild rice in about 5 cups of water. Drained and chilled overnight. In the morning I added soaked, cut up dry shitake mushrooms along with their soaking water with an egg beaten into it. A tablespoon of poultry seasoning, a sauteed onion, plenty of salt and freshly ground pepper. Now you salt and pepper the bird insdie and out, liberally. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees while you are stuffing and sewing up the bird. Place it in the oven in a roaster and on a rack on it's breast. For a 12 1/3 lb. goose I needed a full 5 hours but this is quite a large bird. Just close the oven and let it stay, undisturbed for 1 1/2 hours. After this time, take it out of the oven. Use a baster to draw out the fat that has accumulated in the bottom of the pan (schmaltz lovers, send up a cheer) You can strain this fat through a coffee filter, putting the schmaltz in small bottles which keep very well in the freezer for up to a year.) Turn the bird over on its back before you put it back in the oven. put it back in for another hour before you start checking for doneness. The recipe gave the best advice on checking for doneness, at this point, that I have ever seen. With a piece of terry rag, squeeze the upper drumstick (not thigh) lightly. If it feels kind of squishy, like roast beef, it's done. Every bird is different so you must judge when it is done. When meat is done (be patient, it may take a while), raise the heat to 400 degrees. Remove roaster from the oven and transfer bird (rack and all) to a jelly roll pan. Put it back in the oven for 15 minutes to further crisp and brown the bird. Take it out and let it sit, uncovered for a half an hour. Regarding the roaster, after you remove the bird to a jelly roll pan and put that in the oven, remove the fat from the roaster and put it over 2 burners adding about 2/3 cup of dry sherry and deglaze the pan with a wooden spoon. combine these drippings with your giblet broth either to make a gravy or to use later for goose carcass, slow cooker broth.

      <li>This coming Monday (25 April 94) Australia and New Zealand commemorate their war dead on Anzac Day (Australian &amp; New Zealand Army Corps, which were among the first soldiers ashore in the battle at Gallipoli in 1915 during World War I - a 9-month campaign with grievous losses). This day has become our most important national day of remembrance. Scottish oatmeal biscuits were cooked at home during WWI and sent to the soldiers fighting overseas. After the war, these oat-based biscuits were named Anzac Biscuits when they were made and sold as fund-raisers for returned soldiers. Method: Mix oats, flour, sugar and coconut. Melt syrup and margarine [butter!] together in a small saucepan. Mix soda with boiling water and add to the syrup and margarine mix. Add dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. Place globs (about 1 T each) of the mix onto greased trays, allowing room for spreading while cooking. Cook for about 30 minutes at 150 degrees Celsius [about 300 F] Cool completely on racks before storing any you might have left :-) ianst@qdpii.ind.dpi.qld.gov.au (Ian Staples) Recipe By : _The Cairns Post_ 20 April 1994.

      <li>Ever so delicately, you break the eggs into a fine porcelain bowl—porcelain for reasons of elegance, nothing more—and beat lightly, adding salt and pepper. You warm the butter in the omelet pan sacred to every good cook, and as soon as the butter begins to turn the tint of warm Caribbean skin, you pour in the eggs. When the omelet is half cooked on the bottom, loosen it with infinite gentleness, whispering encouragingly, because if you are rough, it will lose its enchanting disposition; add the chives and salmon and fold it over, exactly as you would close a book. To free it entirely, experts move the skillet back and forth with the pulsing syncopation of a good dancer, and then, with a sudden flip of the wrist, toss it up in the air and catch it, now reversed, so it will cook to a golden brown on both sides—although I admit that every time I've tried that move, the omelet has landed on my head. These gyrations are pure exhibitionism, because when you make an omelet, as when y! ! ou make love, affection counts or more than technique. Serve your omelet on your most beautiful plates, already warmed in the oven. Spoon on the caviar, and beside this triumph place the warm toast and sour cream. After a night of passion, this is the breakfast indicated for making love, no holds barred, the rest of the day.

      <li>NOPE! This isn't a recipe.....but I sure wanted to keep this! --Glen Date: Thu, 14 Mar 1996 16:47:11 -0800 From: Brent Thompson &lt;brent@hplbct.hpl.hp.com&gt; &gt; Are spiders harmful to plants? No, they are beneficial, since they eat pests which attack/damage plants. Except when they are babies, which can confound the picture for maybe a day or two, spiders mostly are larger than, say, 1/8" across (finger-to-toe), and don't travel in herds. &gt; I recently moved to a new apt, and my &gt; plants are now the home to many small spiders. From what I've read, &gt; these don't seem to be spider mites, but I'm not certain. Spraying &gt; with soap cured the problem for about an hour. Any advice? Many mites, on the other hand, e.g. spider mites, are in the set of damage causers. Different types of spider mites vary of course, but most are 1mm or smaller across (finger-to-toe), and once established tend to exist in great population densities, like hundreds per leaf. There are biological controls for spider mites, including various predatory mites. Mark Andersen &lt;mnanders@ingr.com&gt; wrote on 13Jan96 that aphids and fungus gnats are controlled by spraying with a mixture of: 1 C. rubbing alcohol 3 C. water 1/8 C. Dawn dishwashing detergent so maybe this will work for spider mites, too. I'll probably try it this year -- last summer spider mites ate up all my eggplant plants. The life cycle of spider mites is such that mite control spray programs usually specify spraying at least three times, a week apart. ~-- Brent CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #268 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

Per Serving: 75 Calories (22% from fat) Fat 1.8G (Saturated Fat 0.4G) Protein 3.4G Carbohydrate 12.0G Cholesterol5MG Sodium213MG I had some modifications: I omitted the celery (Yuck!) I omitted the pepperoncini peppers (Yuck!) I doubled the artichoke hearts (Yum!!) I used large mushrooms sliced, since there weren't small ones at the store I had no Italian seasoning, so I used about a tablespoon of oregano and a tablespoon of basil, and it worked out fine. I increased the olive oil by about a teaspoon. You could use a light cheese tortellini or a different type of tortellini, or even bow-tie pasta or something, to lessen the fat content. This tasted the best after it had marinated for about 2 days. Recipe taken from "Low Fat Ways to Cook Pasta" by Susan M.

      <li>1 tablespoon Minced lime; lemon, or orange zest, see note</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1 cup Buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups Loosely packed fruit; see note</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. For the topping, mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl or work bowl of a food processor, add butter. If mixing by hand, use fingertips, a pastry blender, or 2 forks to blend the fat into dry ingredients until mixture looks like coarse irregular crumbs, with no visible lumps of fat. If mixing in a food processor, pulse about 10 times, then process 5 to 10 seconds, until there are no visible lumps of fat-, stir in nuts and set aside. 2. For the muffins, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly grease the top surface of a 12-cup muffin pan- use liners, if necessary. Whisk 2 1/2 cups flour with next 4 ingredients in a medium bowl-, set aside. 3. Whisk together next 4 ingredients in a large bowl-, whisk in buttermilk and vanilla. Gently whisk dry ingredients into wet ingredients to partially blend. Continue mixing batter with a rubber spatula, making sure that ingredients at the bottom are incorporated into batter fold in fruit. (Frozen fruit will help "firm" up batter. If batter seems too wet add a few more tablespoons of flour, up to 1/4 cup-to stiffen batter.) 4. Using an ice-cream scoop, place a portion of batter into each muffin cup, filling to the brim. Sprinkle a portion of streusal topping over batter in each muffin cup. 5. Bake 15 minutes-, reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake until muffins are golden brown and spring back when lightly pressed with fingertips, 10 to 12 minutes. Let muffins cool in pan for 5 minutes then transfer them to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 1 dozen. Cook's Illustrated, Sept./Oct. 1993,Page 8. Credit: Stephen Schmidt. Nationality: USA Season:any Courses: batter bread, breakfast Method: baked Start to Finish 1 1/2 hours Preparation 10 minutes Attention 1 hour Finishing 5 minutes Converted from Mangia!, Cook's Illustrated 1993-1995 Cookbook NOTES : To simplify muffin making, quadruple the streusel topping recipe and freeze. Orange, lemon, or lime zests can be used to flavor the muffins, if you like. Lemon works well with blueberry-, orange zest with cranberry or rhubarb-, lime zest with banana chunks.Almost any fruit works in this recipe. Good choices include: fresh or frozen rhubarb, diced-, cranberries, coarsely chopped-,blueberries-, apples, cut into small dice-, bananas, cut into firm,small chunks-, raspberries-, strawberries, quartered or cut into small dice-, dried sour cherries or cranberries. To prevent delicate,highly colored fruits like raspberries, cranberries, and blueberries from getting mashed and discoloring the batter, use semi frozen fruit. It is not necessary to use paper baking liners if the muffin tin is commercial, glazed, or nonstick. continued in part 2</li>

      <li>From: ianst@qdpii.ind.dpi.qld.gov.au (Ian Staples) Date: Sat, 23 Apr 94 22:02:29 +1000 This coming Monday (25 April 94) Australia and New Zealand commemorate their war dead on Anzac Day (Australian &amp; New Zealand Army Corps, which were among the first soldiers ashore in the battle at Gallipoli in 1915 during World War I - a 9-month campaign with grievous losses). This day has become our most important national day of remembrance. Scottish oatmeal biscuits were cooked at home during WWI and sent to the soldiers fighting overseas. After the war, these oat-based biscuits were named Anzac Biscuits when they were made and sold as fund-raisers for returned soldiers. The following recipe was published in _The Cairns Post_ 20 April 1994. Mix oats, flour, sugar and coconut. Melt syrup and margarine [butter!] together in a small saucepan. Mix soda with boiling water and add to the syrup and margarine mix. Add dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. Place globs (about 1 T each) of the mix onto greased trays, allowing room for spreading while cooking. Cook for about 30 minutes at 150 degrees Celsius [about 300 F] Cool completely on racks before storing any you might have left :-) Makes 24.

      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>12 Pork hangers; (Irish breakfast sausages)</li>
      <li>6 slices Irish bacon</li>
      <li>1 package (8-oz) White Breakfast Pudding; sliced into 1/4 inch-thick rounds (see Note)</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>6 large Eggs</li>
      <li>Fresh thyme sprigs; (opt.)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Just a few recipes from Country Living I downloaded and wanted to share. 1. Heat oven to 200'F. Prepare Potato Pancakes and place on large ovenproof platter; keep warm in oven while preparing re- maining ingredients, 2. In large skillet, heat just enough oil to thinly coat bottom of skillet over low heat. Add hangers, arranged in a single layer, and cook, turning frequently, until browned on all sides. Remove hangers to oven platter with Potato Pancakes. Add bacon to skillet and fry, turning frequently, until done. (Irish bacon does not become crispy when cooked; it has the texture and color of smoked ham.) Remove bacon to platter in oven. Add breakfast pudding rounds to skillet and cook, turning, until firm and browned on cut sides; remove to oven platter. 3. Cut tomatoes crosswise in half; sprinkle with 1/8 t salt and 1/8 t pepper. Fry tomatoes, cut sides down, in skillet until lightly browned (do not overcook; tomatoes should retain their shape). Remove to oven platter. 4. Just before serving, fry eggs, in batches, sunny-side up or as desired; transfer to platter and top with remaining salt and ground pepper. Garnish platter with fresh thyme, if desired, and serve immediately. Potato Pancakes: In 4-quart saucepan, cover 4 medium baking potatoes with water and heat to boiling; cover and cook potatoes 25 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain potatoes and cool until easy to han- dle. Peel potatoes and mash in bowl with 1/4 C (1/2 stick) butter. Stir in 1/2 C unsifted all-purpose flour, 1 large egg, 1 T chopped fresh parsley leaves, 1 T chopped fresh chives, 1 t salt, and 1/2 t ground black pepper; mix until well blended. In large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium heat. Shape potato mixture into twelve 2 1/2-inch patties and fry, in batches, until golden brown on both sides, adding more oil as necessary. Serve immediately or keep warm until serving.

      <li>1/4 cups Sherry</li>
      <li>3 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>2 cups Heavy cream</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sherry</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
      <li>Chicken-Hazelnut Quenelles</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Hazelnuts; skins removed, and chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To roast the hazelnuts you should place them on a sheet pan and put them in a 400øF oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the outside skin starts to break away. Rub the hazelnuts together so that the outer dark skins flake off. You do not want to toast them, you just want the skin to loosen up. In a large skillet place the butter and heat it on medium high until it has melted. Add the mushrooms and saut‚ them for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are brown. Add the 1/4 cup of sherry and deglaze the pan. Add the chicken stock. Cook the ingredients on medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced by 1/2. In a small saucepan place the 3/4 cup of sherry. Cook it on medium high heat for 4 to 6 minutes, or until it is reduced by 3/4. Add the reduced sherry, salt, and pepper to soup, and stir them in. In each of 4 individual serving bowls place 3 of the Chicken-Hazelnut Quenelles. Ladle the soup on top. Sprinkle on the hazelnuts.

The favorite around our house is Any Vegetable Soup, especially when I do the cooking. Here it is: PLACE all the ingredients in a soup pot. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until the vegatables are tender, about 20 minutes. Serve hot. We used 2 cups of carrots, 2 cups of celery, 2 cups onions, 2 cups of potatoes, 2 or 3 cups of cabbage, 1 can of corn (2 cups). We used the liquid from the canned corn and the remainder water (about 9 cups of liquid). We used the oregeno one time and and the basil about five times. I prefer the basil.. We also used 1 teas. onion powder and 1/2 teas. garlic powder. We use a generous amount of black pepper to give the soup some zing.

    <recipetext>
      <li>My Granny was a mountain woman from the heart of the Appalachians. She cooked three huge meals a day, and she made corn bread every day...sometimes twice a day. I formulated this recipe from watching her make bread. She never measured anything, so one time I made her stop and let me measure what she was doing. I then cut that amount in half. She baked her cornbread in a big cast-iron skillet in a wood stove. Here's my adaptation of what Granny made.... Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Put about 1 teaspoon bacon drippings in an 8x8 pan, and put it into the oven to heat. In medium bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. stir in remaining ingredients, beating by hand JUST until smooth. Batter will still be lumpy. Pour into hot, prepared pan. Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until done in center. Immediately remove from pan, and cool a little. Cut into nine squares. Posted to EAT-L Digest by "Sharon H.

      <li>Message-ID: &lt;31cp01$383@sunb.ocs.mq.edu.au&gt; Organization: Macquarie University Date: Sat, 30 Jul 1994 15:00:08 GMT I had it in mind to post this recipe just before Anzac Day (25 April). To the best of my knowledge, these biscuits earned their name because they were a favoured item in food parcels sent by families to Australian troops serving overseas in WW2. The biscuit is nourishing, keeps well, isn't reduced to crumbs through rough handling, and can be softened by a dunking in hot tea. (Though personally I prefer ice-cold creamy milk.) Mix all the dry ingredients together. Melt butter and syrup in a saucepan, add soda and water, pour over dry ingredients. Mix well. Drop pieces the size of walnuts onto greased trays, leaving room for them to spread to about 2 1/2 inches. Cook about 15 minutes in a slow oven, until a golden brown. When taken from the oven biscuits are very soft, so leave on the tray for one minute, then cool on a wire rack till crisp. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /COOKIES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>Fresh ground pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet. When foam subsides add the bacon. Fry 5 to 10 minutes or until the bacon is lightly browned. Remove from skillet and set on paper towels to drain. Fry the onion slices for 6 to 8 minutes in the fat remaining in the skillet, adding more butter as necessary. When the onions are soft and transparent, add the apple rings and cover the pan. Simmer over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently at intervals to prevent the apples from sticking. When the apple rings are sufficiently cooked (they should offer little or no resistence when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer), return the drained bacon to the skillet. Cover and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until the bacon is heated through. Grind fresh black pepper liberally over the top and serve directly from the pan as a luncheon entr‚e or Sunday night supper.

      <li>Bob "Docpepr" Opersteny &lt;RAO@CORHCC1.HCC.COM&gt; Aoli (Garlic Dressing) (Base recipe by Frugal Gourmet: Jeff Smith) Pedro's Spanish Alioli below reminded me of the greek version of this recipe; which is essentially garlic mayonaise/salad dressing. You can add chiles or Sriracha for a dip/bread spread for fast garlic bread, etc. Blend/whip 1 egg at room temperature add garlic (pressed) into blender blend and slowly add olive oil; till emulsion turns white/whipped-will look like mayonaise stir in juice of 1/2 lemon or 1 lime (if you've got the really big ones, taste after adding 1/2 amount) Use for potato salad, salad dressing, cold chicken salad, garlic bread, Keep Refrigerated! Note: no salt was added to base recipe, as this was to be a blood-pressure friendly recipe; the natural aolin(?sp) from the garlic, along with the olive oil has been known to help blood pressure and heart stress. You may add salt, chiles, spices as desired to create effect as desired. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

Meanwhile, in crockpot, place chicken broth (I used 1/2 cup warm water with 3 chicken bouillon cubes), cumin, coriander, parsley flakes, curry powder, and pepper. In a small separate dish, combine the cornstarch and soy sauce. When smooth, stir into the crockpot with the spice mixture. Add the browned chicken and onion mixture into the broth/spice mixture in crockpot. Gently stir in the yogurt. Set crockpot on low and cook for about 3 to 4 hours. Genevieve Lehman, Rockville, MD submitted the original format of this recipe in the National Chicken Cooking Contest. Serving Ideas : Over fresh pasta or basmati rice. NOTES : This recipe has been modified from its original format by Leilani Young. Served this to my hubby with rave reviews. Original recipe called for 1 whole cut-up broiler-fryer chicken, and to be prepared on stovetop in large covered skillet.

Continue cooking, stirring frequently, to soft ball stage. Remove from heat and mix in peanut butter. Cool to about 120 degrees F and mix in vanilla. Spread in suitable size pan (the larger the pan, the thinner each piece of candy will be; I use a 8x8 pan). Fudge will still be very soft at this stage; it takes a few hours to set up.

      <li>Add dry ingredients to the batter, mixing well. Stir in 1/4 C raisins or date pieces (found in the bulk bins at some health food stores). Fill cupcake size muffin tins 3/4 full. (Batter is very thick.) Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees, until top is brown and has a hard crust. Cool slightly, then remove from tins. Makes 12. This is a great recipe to double or triple, depending on how many ripe bananas you have. These freeze beautifully and can be popped in the oven or toaster oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes to give them that fresh baked feel, if desired. I use a nonstick muffin pan but I just picked up some cushionaire muffin tins and find the breads came out lighter now. I do NOT spray the tins with any Pam.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Milk</li>
      <li>2 packages Dry yeast</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>3 Eggs -- room temp</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>6 1/2 cups Flour -- to 7-1/2 cups</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>Butter or margarine --</li>
      <li>Melted</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>12 ounces Dark raisins</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine milk, water, and 1/3 c. margarine in a saucepan. Heat until liquids are very warm (120-130~). Margarine doesn't need to melt. Place 6 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast in Bowl. Mix for about 1 minute, then gradually add eggs, then warm liquid. Mix until smooth. Add remaining flour until dough clings to dough hook (or becomes unmanageable for your mixer). Remove from bowl and knead for 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes. (Know what I do? I put a towel on a rack in my oven and set the bowl there. And then I close the oven door and turn the oven on its lowest setting while counting to 20. Turn the oven off; this seems to provide the bread an optimal temperature for rising.) Meanwhile, combine 1/2 c. sugar and cinnamon. Punch dough down. Little by little, knead in those raisins until distributed evenly. Divide dough in half; roll each half to a 14x9" rectangle. Brush lightly with melted margarine. Sprinkle each with half cinnamon-sugar mixture. Beginning at the 9" end, tightly roll dough and shape into loaves. Place in 2 greased 9" loaf pans. Cover; let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes. Take the loaves AND the towel out of your oven (towel flambe just ain't that chic, folks). Place oven rack on lowest position. Loosely "tent" aluminum foil over top of each loaf. Preheat oven to 375~. Bake for about 40 minutes; remove foil "tents" and brush tops of loaves with margarine. Bake 5 minutes longer. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks. NOTE: Best to toast this in a toaster oven inasmuch as the cinnamon swirls tend to "separate" a bit. But this alters the taste not in the slightest! Millions (well LOTS) of palates have thrilled to this stuff. Yours will, too!

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 tablespoons Oil</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>450 grams Potatoes, diced into 2cm</li>
      <li>Pieces</li>
      <li>1 small Cauliflower</li>
      <li>Cut into 2cm pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1/3 teaspoons Chilli powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cummin</li>
      <li>2 Tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>200 grams Peas</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Garam Masala (see below)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Heat the oil in a karahi(wok) over medium high heat 2. Add the onions and fry for 3-4 minutes until light brown 3. Add the potatoes and cauliflower and stir. Add the turmeric, chilli, cummin, tomatoes, salt and sugar. Stir fry for 2-3 minutes. 4. Add the peas, cover and reduce heat to a medium low and cook for about 20 minutes until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender. During the cooking period stir the vegetables a few times to stop them sticking. 5. Sprinkle with garam masala. It's that easy! Garam Masala means "hot spices" and is a mixture of ground spices that is used sparingly, sprinkled either on a finished dish or on to the foods just before it has finished cooking. It is far better to grind your own spices than to buy the mixture ready-ground. Bought garam masala often contains inferior quality spices and will not keep its flavour for long. For homemade garam masala, grind together cardamom seeds from 10 pods, 25g cinnamon stick, 6 cloves and 6-8 whole black peppercorns. Store in an airtight jar in a cool place.

      <li>2 pounds Anaheim or New Mex. chiles; Roast; peel, deseed</li>
      <li>1 pound Yellow Hungarian Wax chiles; seeded and chopped</li>
      <li>1 Serranos and jalapeno; seeded and chopped</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Lime juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Salt</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Corn Starch</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe By: Bill Wight via chile-heads Heat a large cast iron skillet to hot and toast the tomatoes and tomatillos without any oil. Do just one layer at a time and give each slice a nice dark brown color on both sides without burning. Remove when toasted to a glass bowl. Do not deglaze the pan. In a blender, combine the onion, cilantro, chiles, tomatoes, garlic and tomatillos in batch sizes to half-fill the blender jar. Pur‚e. If any dark brown liquid collects in the bottom of the toasted tomato and tomatillo bowl, add this to the last blender load. Mix the cornstarch in the lime juice/vinegar. In a large stewing pot, combine the blender loads, add the cornstarch mixture and heat until the sauce comes to a low boil, mixing constantly. Be careful here, if you don't mix constantly the thick sauce will tend to erupt in hot little geysers of taco sauce that could burn you. Allow sauce to cool and add salt to taste. Transfer to clean jars, filling them 3/4 full and freeze what you can't use in a few weeks. Be careful not to fill the jars too full or they'll break when you freeze them. I made a batch of sauce last year and it tastes just fine after a year in the freezer. The sauce keeps OK in my refrigerator for at least a month. * Adjust heat level to your personal taste. The La Victoria sauce is mild. 3 to 4 quarts Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #089 Date: Fri, 30 Aug 1996 22:56:42 -0400 From: kmeade@ids2.idsonline.com (The Meades) CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #089 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 cups Lowfat chicken broth OR vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 ounce Bean sprouts; rinsed</li>
      <li>1 ounce Bamboo shoots; rinsed and julienned</li>
      <li>1 Stalk bok choy; diagonally sliced (altertive: celery and napa cabbage leaves)</li>
      <li>3 ounces Chinese pea pods; rinsed and strings pulled</li>
      <li>6 Dried Chinese mushrooms; soaked in boiling water, rinsed and drained and julienned</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Tamari soy; or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kung pao sauce; or more to taste</li>
      <li>Leftover soba noodle; optional</li>
      <li>10 ounces Firm tofu; or as packaged drained and sliced, *see instructions</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Potato starch; dissolved in</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Egg substitute; beaten with</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Light sesame oil</li>
      <li>Cilantro leaves; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 dash Dark sesame oil; for aroma</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Hot pepper sauce; optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Rinse the pea pods and trim, pulling strings if necessary; leave them whole. If bok choy is not available, use a combination of celery and napa cabbage leaves; slice on the bias into bite-sized pieces. Slice the tofo (bean Curd) cakes into 1/4-inch thick pieces, then carefully slice again into strips 1 by 1/4-inch (julienned). Place the broth in a large soup pan; add the bean sprouts, then bamboo shoots, bok choy, pea pods, and mushrooms. Slowly bring to a gentle boil. Add the sauces: hoisin, soy and kung pao. Let simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or until bok choy is wilted and the sprouts have lost their bitter bite. Add a little cooked soba noodle, if using. Add the bean curd slivers. And as soon as the soup returns to a boil, slowly stir in the well-stirred dissolved potato starch. Slowly bring to a boil again. Slowly pour in the beaten egg through the gap of a pair of chopsticks or along the back of a fork, moving the chopsticks or fork in a circular motion to shirr the egg. Remove at once from heat and cover for 30 seconds to allow egg to set and the soup will also clear somewhat. Remove from heat. Add the coriander leaves. Stir gently to mix. Season with vinegar. Then adjust the sauces: soy, hoisin, or kung pao, to taste. Offer pepper oil at the table for those who want it hotter. By KitPATh &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; Notes: Recipe was revised for bottled sauces. Quantities are approximate; to taste and to what is on hand. The technique and the use of potato starch are ideas from CHINESE COOKING by Yan Kit Martin. Have ingredients prepared and assembled. This is a variation of an egg drop soup. The boil is also gentle and steady; never allow the broth to roil. Recipe by: Hanneman* Posted to EAT-LF Digest by KitPATh &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; on Apr 20, 1998</li>

      <li>1 Box vanilla wafers</li>
      <li>1 Stick butter</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: DIRECTIONS</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Crush wafers in food processor or blender until finely ground. Melt butter and mix with wafers for crust. Press into a 10 inch springform pan with your fingers, take care to make the crust as thin as possible with special attention to the corners where the crust tends to be a bit thick. Filling: Ingredients: 3 large pkg. cream cheese 3/4 cup sugar juice of one large lemon 3 grade A large eggs Directions: Blend thoroughly the cream cheese, sugar and lemon juice. Mix until smooth . Add eggs and blend well. Pour mixture into crust and bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees. When done the cake will be set (not solid), slightly golden, and perhaps split on top. It is better slightly over and not under done. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. It will firm up more on cooling. This is an important step...cool for about 45 minutes. Topping: Ingredients: 3 cups sour cream 3/4 cup sugar 2 tsp vanilla Directions: Mix sour cream, 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla. Pour on top of cooled cake. Return to 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate and cool thoroughly (overnight is fine) but at least 5-6 hours). Freezes well. You may serve now if you do not care for a glaze or for a killer bodiller glaze.... Glaze: Ingredients: 1 can (1 lb) sour pitted cherries (packed in water) 1/2 cup sugar 1 tbs cornstarch 1 tbs lemon juice 2 drops red food coloring Directions: Drain cherries, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Put aside cherries. In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch. Add cherry liquid, stir until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil 1 minute..until thick and clear. Remove from heat, let cool slightly. Add lemon juice, cherries, food coloring. Cool until still warm but pourable. Pour on top on chilled cheese cake. Refrigerate for an hour or so.....While the cake may be prepared a day before, do not glaze until the day that you plan to serve. I have also used commercially prepared pie fillings as a glaze with good results.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds (700g) potatoes</li>
      <li>1 pound (450g) fresh spinach (weighed without stalks) or frozen thawed</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Grated fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Turmeric powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Red chilli powder (or to taste, and depending on its heat!)</li>
      <li>2 medium Tomatoes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe adapted from Sameen Rushdie's `Indian Cookery' Serves 6 as part of a mixed meal, maybe 3-4 on its own with rice/naan and a pickle. This works well with either fresh or frozen spinach. I have made it with kale as well; 10oz (275g) weighed without stalks. 1. Scrub potatoes and boil them in their skins until almost, but not quite, done. Leave to cool, then cut into small cubes. 2. Meanwhile, if using fresh spinach or kale, remove the coarse stalks then rinse and cook gently for 10 minutes, in just the water clinging to the leaves in a covered pan. Cool and chop (reserve any remaining liquid). For frozen spinach, just defrost and chop. 3. Chop the onion finely, crush or finely chop the garlic and finely chop the tomatoes (keep them all separate). Measure the spices out into a little bowl. 4. Now brown the onion in a little vegetable stock or water until golden brown - about 10 minutes perhaps, topping up with hot water as necessary. Let it stick slightly from time to time to get that fried smell. 5. Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and stir for a moment. Add the spices, and a little more water if necessary. Cook for a few minutes, then add the tomato. Cook gently 3-5 minutes. 6. Add the potatoes and spinach, mix well then cover and simmer gently until ready, stirring once or twice to prevent sticking. It's done whenever the potatoes are cooked to your liking and the spices have permeated the vegetables.

      <li>3 cups Broth chicken, beef, or</li>
      <li>Vegetable</li>

      <li>1 pound (2 medium) rutabagas</li>

      <li>3/4 cups Jarlsberg cheese (I used ff</li>
      <li>Cheese instead)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a 5-6 quart pan (I used a small roaster) cook onions and carrots in 1/2 cup of broth until softened. Add to this the parsley. Peel and thinly slice the potatoes and rutabagas. Arrange half of the potato/rutabaga combo in the bottom of the pan (I sprayed with Pam first). Top with half the onion/carrot mixture. Repeat with the other half of the ingredients. Over the top, pour the rest of the broth. Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours in a 425 degree oven. Top with cheese and sprinkle with nutmeg. Broil until cheese is browned. Makes 10-12 servings Comment: I wanted to share a recipe which I have been making this winter for my family. It is a good cold weather dish. It makes enough for a crowd ~ my family (2 adults and 3 teens) only eat about half. This can be made ahead and chilled until ready to use. Source: Sunset Magazine.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Must be all the postings with great Indian recipes (and because the cauliflower in the local supermarket looked superb) that we had this dish tonight. As I remember, someone asked for more veggie Indian dishes, and this is veggie, low fat, and delicious. The amount of spices is up to you and your taste buds. Also, the recipe as given in the book is sort of skimpy for 4, so I tossed in more cauliflower, more peas, more potatoes, and double the amount of spices. Enjoy! Source: Indian Light Cooking, by Ruth Law Category: pareve veggie main dishes Preparation time: 45-60 min. (depends on how fast you can chop) Serves: 4 Cook the cauliflower, potatoes, and fresh peas, each separately, in boiling water until tender. Drain and set aside. Combine the turmeric, cumin, cayenne, and coriander powder in a small bowl. Heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet over moderate heat, and add the spices. Cook for a few seconds to release the flavors. Add the cauliflower, potatoes, peas, and tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes over medium to low heat, and add perhaps a 1/4-cup of water if needed. Cook a bit more until all is heated through, add salt and coriander leaves, and cook a few more minutes. Serve with rice and enjoy!

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat oven to 350º. French cut beans by cutting them in half lengthwise, running the knife down the flat part between the seams of the bean. If the beans are long, cut them at an angle into lengths of about 2 inches. Steam until crisply tender, from 3 to 5 minutes. When cooked through, but still slightly crunchy, remove from the steamer. 2. In large skillet, melt 2 tbs of the butter and add the onion. Cook until translucent. Stir in the sour, pepper and the green beans. Add salt to taste. Mix to coat all ingredients and turn off heat. 3. Spread mixture into a lightly greased casserole. Layer the cheese over it. Top with bread crumbs, and dot with the remaining butter. (At this point the dish can be baked immediately or refrigerated for 24 hours; bring to room temperature before cooking.) 4. Bake for 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the sauce bubbly. Serve hot or warm.

      <li>;pitted (about 2 pounds)</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the cherries and sugar in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan, and, stirring gently, bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 2 or 3 minutes, or until the cherries have softened somewhat and given off most of their liquid. Remove from the heat. In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole, heat the olive oil over moderate heat until a light haze forms above it. Pat the chicken completely dry with paper towels and sprinkle it inside and out with salt. Brown the chicken in the hot oil, turning it frequently with a large spoon or tongs and regulating the heat so that the bird colors quickly and deeply without burning. Place the chicken on a plate and add the onion slices to the oil remaining in the casserole. Stirring frequently, cook for about 10 minutes, or until the slices are richly browned. Return the chicken and all of the juices which have accumulated on the plate to the casserole, add the « cup of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Transfer the chicken to a plate, set aside 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid and discard the onion slices. When the bird is cool enough to handle, cut it into 6 or 8 serving pieces. Meanwhile, bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a heavy 4 to 5 quart casserole with a tightly fitting lid. Pour in the rice in a slow, thin stream so the water does not stop boiling. Stir once or twice, boil briskly for 5 minutes, then drain the rice in a sieve. Pour the reserved chicken cooking liquid and 4 tablespoons of the melted butter into the casserole and stir them together. Add half of the rice and, with a spatula or spoon, smooth it to the edges of the casserole. Cook uncovered over moderate heat for 5 minutes, then remove the casserole from the heat and add the chicken and half of the reserved cherries. Spread the remaining rice on top and pour in all the remaining cherries and their cooking liquid. Cover tightly and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender. To serve, spoon about a cup of the rice into a small bowl, add the remaining 4 tablespoons of melted butter and the dissolved saffron and stir until the mixture is bright yellow. Place a layer of rice on a heated platter. Arrange the chicken on top of it, cover the chicken with the remaining rice and cherry mixture. Sprinkle the saffron rice on top. With a metal spatula, lift the rice crust from the bottom of the casserole and arrange small pieces of it around the edge of the platter. 92 of 116 Source: Time Life Series: Middle Eastern Cooking "circa 69" MMed by: earl.cravens@salata.com Beach, CA * 310-543-0439 28.8k (1:102/125) Ä Area: International Cooking ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Msg#: 66 Date: 24 Mar 95 23:22:00 From: EARL CRAVENS Read: Yes Replied: No To: ALL Mark: Save Subj: T/L Mid East 093-116 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ ÄÄÄ File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip</li>

SERVES: 4 Source: _From Bengal to Punjab: The Cuisines of India_ by Smita Chandra posted by Anne MacLellan Paneer Cheese You can substitute farmer's cheese if you don't want to make your own paneer. Ingredients 1/2 gallon of milk 2-3 Tbsp lemon juice Preparation Put the milk in a stainless steel pot and start boiling it. It's best if you stir it with a wooden sppon. You must stir it regularly, to make sure it doesn't burn (if it burns, it will be absolutely unusable). Once the milk is thoroughly boiling, remove the heat and add the lemon juice. The milk starts curdling right now. Have another pot ready. Also, you'll need a strainer covered with a cheesecloth. Scoop the curds and whey into the strainer, dripping the liquids into the pot. The curds should all have remained in the cheesecloth. Wrap the cheesecloth so as to cover the curds completely. Press the cheesecloth a little bit with your hands or a spoon. The point is to squeeze every last bit of whey out of the paneer. Makes 1 block of paneer cheese. Posted to EAT-L Digest by Tania Hewes &lt;taniah@NSERV1.CLSI.US.GEAC.COM&gt; on</li>

      <li>I've made something similar quite often. The only difference is I mix the ground meat with the rice and 1 Tbs. of Worschestershire to form meatballs. Once the rest of the mixture starts to boil, I add the meatballs and let cook for at least an hour. The longer it cooks, the thicker it is. And yes, I do add golden raisins. Even thought I'm not a raisin fan, they do add a sweetness to the dish. I love this over mashed potatoes!

      <li>Here in the South, Brunswick stew and/or Burgoo have long been traditionally served alongside barbeque. Since it's been so cold here on the east coast this past week, I thought I'd share some Brunswick Stew and Burgoo recipes from the Bubba-L archives to pass the time. Y'all enjoy--they're good! As a fellow Southron "shivering" in this inhospitable Northern iceland (why go to Reyjavik when you can have it all here?), I want to pass on to you one of my Brunswick Stew recipe to fortify you before grading student papers, prepare lectures, and such. Starting way in advance, poach one 4 lb chicken. Then add a 2 lb rabbit that's been quartered (if you don't find any in your backyard by all means substitute veal) and put on high heat and then simmer with the chicken with additional water to cover. You should add the rabbit some 35 minutes after having poached the chicken. When done, drain, reserve the stock and cool the meats on a platter. Once the meats are cool enough to touch with your fingers, bone the chicken and the rabbit and chop into bite-size pieces. Return the chicken and rabbit morsels into the stockpot and add a Virginia ham bone (if you got one) along with 2 cups of sliced onions, 2 cups of chopped celery, 1 cup carrots, and 2 cups of sliced cabbage. Add garlic, marjoram, 2 bay leaves, and a little dash of cayenne (optional). Stir in 2-3 lbs of chopped tomatoes with juice, bring to a boil, then simmer for 25 minutes. Add 1 lb of lima beans, 1 1/2 lbs chopped potatoes, and 4 cups of corn. Bring to a boil again and then simmer, stir the pot a bit to prevent burning. This will take another hour. Season with salt and black pepper. An option is to sprinkle finely chopped parsley into the pot. You can serve this on a bed of rice, or with biscuit, or, as I like to do, with fresh baguettes. A nicely tossed salad with vinaigrette dressing would be a nice accompaniment to your stew. Choose a good, full-bodied red wine to serve with your stew and you and your guests can tell winter to do its worst.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Mini- Quiche Appetizers; Serves 30</li>
      <li>Stuffed Mushrooms; Serves 18</li>
      <li>Alouette French Canapes</li>
      <li>Provencal Flat bread; Serves 4</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mini- Quiche Appetizers: Blend 1/2 cup milk, 2 eggs and 1 (6.5 oz) pkg of Alouette. Fill two (2.1 oz) pkgs. mini-phyllo shells and bake at 375~ for 8-10 minutes or until set. Makes 30 appetizers. Stuffed Mushrooms: Clean 18 mushrooms and remove stems. Place hollow side up on baking sheet. Fill with 1 tsp Alouette and sprinkle with seasoned bread crumbs. Bake at 375~ for 12-15 minutes. Garnish and serve. Alouette French Canapes: Using cookie cutters, cut out shapes of thawed puff pastry, brush with beaten egg and bake at 400~ for approx. 5 minutes or until golden. Cool and using a decorative tip, pipe on Alouette and garnish. Provencal Flat bread: Spread Alouette on pre-baked 7" gourmet flat bread, top with your favorite topping choices such as olives, peppers, sundried or cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts, shrimp or chicken and bake until the cheese bubbles. Cut into small wedges and serve as an appetizer. Serves 4. Entertaining Tips: Surround Alouette with creative accompaniments such as spiced nuts, olives, crusty breads, Italian toasts, fresh or marinated mushrooms, crudites, etc. Attractive garnishes are fast, fun and always add appetite appeal and color. Try sliced olives, capers, red caviar, pimentos, fresh herbs or edible flowers. For outstanding color and appetite appeal, arrange leaves of purple kale in a circle in the center of serving plate. Position the Alouette ramekin cup in the center of the kale leaves and surround with colorful vegetables. Planning your party. Allow 1 pkg of Alouette for every 4 people. Offer guests a variety of beverages such as fine wines, wine coolers, aperitives, sparkling waters or ciders, freshly squeezed fruit juices, iced teas, etc. In Summer or warm weather, remember to keep Alouette cool at all times. If your party will last several hours, put the Alouette ramekin on ice. NOTES : I bought the 6.5 oz pkg of Alouette Sundried Tomato et Basil gourmet spreadable cheese and all these wonderful recipes and party ideas were on the back of the pkg. There were other flavored cheeses by Alouette as well so I imagine you could use any of those flavored cheeses with these recipes.

      <li>Clean the artichokes: remove the external leaves and cut off the stem. Cut off the top leaves with a sharp knife, too. Put the clean artichokes in a bowl with cold water, to avoid that they become black. In another bowl, boil water and add the drained artichokes one by one, to avoid that the water stop boiling. In the meantime, fry the chopped onion in a pan with oil, the chopped garlic cloves and the sliced bacon or ham. When they become golden, remove the pan from fire and add the flour. Drain the bowled artichokes and add to the onion sauce. Serve hot. I hope you understand my little English and you enjoy this receipe.

      <li>Here is a recipe that is best assembled the night before, after the kids are in bed, then popped into the oven when you get home from work. While it bakes, put your feet up, let the kids watch Barney (the purple dinosaur I hate), have a glass of chilled wine, and relax..... Brown hamburger and onion; drain. Add Ragu, spices, sugar, salt, and water. Simmer for about 30 minutes. Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain. In a "lasagna" sized casserole, layer the drained noodles and the ragu mixture, beginning and ending with the sauce. Top with shredded cheese. Bake at 375 degrees (covered) for 45 minutes. Uncover, and bake for 10 minutes more. Optional center layer: Mix together 1 egg, 1 1/2 cups cottage cheese, salt, and pepper. Spread this over the first layer of sauce/noodles, and then continue layering. This optional center layer will make this casserole taste just like lasagna. This casserole can be prepared to the baking point, then frozen. Thaw before baking. Make TWO casseroles out of this if you have a small family. Bake one and freeze one for an emergency. Personal note: This recipe was given to me by Alice Robertson, my next door neighbor. Whenever either of us makes this, we divide the casserole in two parts and share with each other.

      <li>2 Cloves garlic; pressed (up to 3)</li>
      <li>1 package (8 oz) cream cheese; cut up</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Fresh Parmesan cheese; grated (up to 3/4)</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large sauce pan lightly cook the garlic (DO NOT BROWN) . Add the cheeses, butter, cream and milk, whisking constantly until smooth. If the sauce is too thick, you may want to add a little milk. Toss fettucini lightly with sauce, coating well. This recipe is easily doubled, tripled, or whatever for large crowds and any leftover sauce freezes well. This recipe is enough sauce for about 1/2 to 3/4 pound (before cooking) of fettucini and will serve 3 or 4 as a side dish. NOTES : E hele mai oukou e ai! (Come and eat!)

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/3 cups Whole Wheat Flour - 100%</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Butter -- Margarine or Veg</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Vital Gluten or Gluten</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Barley Malt Liquid</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Lecithin Granules</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups Water (11 fl oz)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Dry milk powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Yeast -- Red Star</li>
      <li>Quick-Rise</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>DIRECTIONS: This recipe is made-to-order for Panasonic 65. Convert as necessary to use in other machines. Place ingredients in baking kettle as listed, with the exception of the yeast, which should be placed in the dispenser. Set on Rapid Rise Cycle or 3 hour cycle. The Barley Malt Liquid is used in place of other liquid sweetener such as molasses or honey. The gluten is added so that the loaf will rise higher than it would with Whole Wheat Flour alone, and the Lecithin is added for texture and tenderness of crumb. Be sure to use Quick-Rise yeast for this particular recipe to assure a good rise. It has a nice crust and elastic texture, is easy to slice. This makes a 1-1/2 loaf for the Panasonic 65 - appx 7.5 long x 4.5 wide x 7.5-7.75 high, 1-1/2 lb loaf. Have tested it several times and turns out fine each time.

      <li>Alfred Portale's Jumbo Asparagus Salad with Prosciuttode Parma, Parmesan, and Lemon Vinaigrette 1. For the vinaigrette, mix lemon juice, zest, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl. Whisk in olive oil and set aside. 2. Bring 1 inch water to boil in a soup kettle. Put asparagus in steamer basket then carefully place steamer basket in kettle and cover and steam over medium-high heat until asparagus spears bend slightly when picked up and flesh at cut end yields when squeezed, 4 to 5 minutes for asparagus under 1/2 inch in diameter, 5 to 6 minutes for the jumbo size. Drain and plunge spears immediately into ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain again, cover, and refrigerate until chilled, as long as overnight. 3. In a medium bowl, combine the shallots, thyme, asparagus, sliced potatoes, and 1 tablespoon chives. Add 1/4 cup vinaigrette toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 4. Arrange asparagus-potato mixture with the prosciutto alongside it on 4 large serving plates. Dress lettuces with another 1/4 cup vinaigrette, and arrange a portion on each plate. Use a vegetable peeler to shave Parmesan curls over each salad. Press eggs through a fine sieve. Sprinkle each salad with sieved egg and remaining chives-, serve immediately with remaining dressing passed separately. Cook's Illustrated, May/June 1993, Page 7. Credit: Stephanie Lyness.

      <li>1 Or more Tb butter</li>
      <li>5 Raw jumbo shrimp; shelled/deveined</li>
      <li>4 Black olives; pitted</li>
      <li>4 Green olives; pitted</li>
      <li>4 Ripe cherry tomatoes</li>

      <li>1 pinch Dried tarragon; generous-crumbled</li>
      <li>1 Portion cooked orzo</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt the butter in a saute pan over fairly high heat. Toss in the remaining ingredients, except the orzo, all at once. Let it all sizzle up, turning the shrimp once, and immediately serve over the orzo the moment the shrimp are cooked. It takes just minutes. In the restaurant, each portion was cooked to order in its own little pan. Four or so portions can be prepared at a time in a 12-inch or larger pan. The ingredients should not be crowded. NOTES : This dish was created for visual and culinary effect. It turned out to be an all-time favorite at Alice's Restaurant. Serves 1.

    <title>Alfred a Knopf Peanut Butter Candy</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>32</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 cups Graham cracker crumbs</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Confectioners sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Chunky peanut butter</li>
      <li>8 ounces Milk chocolate</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Line an 8-inch square pan as follows. Turn the pan over, cover with a 12-inch square of aluminum foil shiny side down, fold down the sides and corners to shape the foil, remove the foil, turn the pan over again, and place the foil into the pan, pressing it carefully to fit smooth. Set aside. In the large bowl of an electric mixer (or any large bowl, with a wooden spatula) mix the butter with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and peanut butter. Turn into the lined pan. With the bottom of a teaspoon smooth the mixture to make an even layer. Let stand at room temperature. Break up the chocolate and place it in the top of a small double boiler over hot water on low heat. Cover with a folded paper towel (to absorb steam) and the pot cover. Let stand for a few minutes until partly melted. Then uncover and stir until completely melted and smooth. Remove the top of the double boiler (dry its underside), and pour the chocolate onto the peanut butter layer. With the bottom of a teaspoon smooth the chocolate all over the bottom layer, touching the sides of the foil. Refrigerate for an hour (or longer, if you wish) until firm. Lift the candy from the pan by lifting the aluminum foil. Place the candy, still on the foil, on a cutting board. Fold down the sides of the foil and let stand. If you cut this into squares while it is cold it will crumble. Let it stand for about an hour, then cut into 32 small bars. Serve at room temperature. The taste will remind you of Reese's peanut butter cups. Recipe is from _Maida Heatter's Book of Great American Desserts_.

    <title>All-American Cole Slaw</title>
    <category>Salads</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Green cabbage; quartered, cored, and shredded fine</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Vinegar; cider, malt, distld</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 Onion, small; grated (optnl)</li>
      <li>2 Carrot, medium; grated</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, toss the cabbage with the vinegar and salt. Grate the carrots and optional onion directly into the bowl. Add the mayonnaise and toss well. The slaw can be served immediately, but it is much better -- more melded and tender -- if allowed to stand and tossed occasionally for 30 minutes to 1 hour. For a very limp slaw, refrigerate several hours or overnight. ^^^^^^^^^^ The law on cole slaw is cabbage and vinegar. All the rest is interpretation. Adjust the recipe to taste: Add more mayonnaise, substitute sour cream or yogurt for some (but not all) of the mayonnaise, or add a supplement of one or the other. Add diced green and/or red pepper if you have one, celery or caraway seeds if you like that kind of thing, or shredded celery for an extra fresh taste.

Bring to boil, add molasses, Cascade, and Mt. Hood hops. Boil one hour. Add finishing hops. Boil 5 min. Cool down in sink. Add yeast from starter. I recently tasted my all-grain porter against Anchor's and the big thing I notice was Anchor Porter is thick, creamy. Mine is low carbonated, but it does not have that creamy feel. This was my first all-grain brew and my first porter. It has a good malt flavor. Next time I would cut back on the hops some.

      <li>2 ounces Pork drippings**</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons. ** Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet. You may change the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be all chicken, etc., provided the total amount remains the same. You can use partridge, quail, duck, and so on... Boil the meats together long enough to make the bones separate from the meat by themselves. Reserve the resulting broth and set meats aside. In a large bowl place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth. Cover with a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with an wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and a little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix thoroughly. When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and the pork drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie each 'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling concentrated in the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty. Smoke for 2 or 3 hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together before selling or using - the 'alheira' should be U shaped. A typical way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil, and presenting them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add broccoli as a side dish. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1. Preheat the oven to 375 F. Butter and lightly flour two 8-inch round cake pans. 2. Make the cake: Place the cocoa in a small bowl and whisk in the boiling water to form a paste. 3. Combine the chocolate and milk in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir frequently until the chocolate melts, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Whisk a small amount of the hot chocolate milk into the cocoa paste to warm it. Whisk the cocoa mixture into the milk mixture. Return the pan to medium heat and stir for 1 minute. Remove and set aside to cool until tepid. 4. In the bowl of a mixer, cream the butter and sugar together. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, and add the vanilla. Slowly stir in the chocolate mixture. 5. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using a spatula or a wooden spoon, slowly add the flour mixture to the chocolate mixture. Fold in until just mixed. 6. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the batter. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, 45 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a rack for 15 minutes. Gently remove the cakes from the pans and continue to cool. 7. While the cake is baking, make the filling: Combine the cocoa and boiling water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in the sugar and chocolate. Add the dissolved cornstarch paste and salt to the pan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the vanilla and butter. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until cool. 8. Make the frosting: Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot, not simmering, water, stirring until smooth. Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat and whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Return the top to the heat, if necessary, to melt the butter. 9. Whisk in the hot water all at once and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the corn syrup and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for up to 15 minutes prior to using. 10. Assemble the cake: Use a sharp serrated knife to slice each cake layer horizontally in half to form 4 layers. Set 1 layer aside. Place 1 layer on a cake round or plate. Generously swath the layer with one- third of the filling. Add the second layer and repeat. Set the third layer on top. Quickly apply a layer of frosting to the top and the sides of the cake. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. 11. Meanwhile, crumble the remaining cake layer. Apply the remaining frosting to the cake. Sprinkle it liberally with the cake crumbs. Serve the cake within 24 hours. Store in a cool place. continued in part 2</li>

      <li>From: Marilyn Sultar &lt;spartica@FRONTIERNET.NET&gt; Date: Sat, 10 Aug 1996 12:52:55 +0000 When I was working for the Jewish Home in Rochester, a wonderful resident by the name of Mary Shapiro, may she rest in peace, told me to get her sister's recipe for kreplach. I did, and this is it! It makes declicious kreplach! DOUGH: Mix all ingredients in mixer with dough hooks until dough forms ball. Put dough on floured board &amp; knead for a bit. Divide the dough into 2 and roll thin. Cut into strips &amp; then squares. Fill. Fold into triangles. Pinch sides together. FILLING: Cook meat in oil with onion &amp; carrot before you grind. After cool, add egg. Then mix everything together. After Kreplach are filled, blast freeze. Throw into plastic bag after frozen. When ready to serve, boil in salted water (1 tbsp. regular salt). Boil 20-25 mins., then throw into hot soup. If dough feels sticky, add a little flour. JEWISH-FOOD digest 312 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

    <title>Alexandrian Cumin Bread</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 cups Unbleached, all-purpose</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>1 package Dried yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cumin seed, ground</li>
      <li>1 cup Plus 3 oz. lukewarm water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1) Place the flour, yeast, salt, and ground cumin in a large mixing bowl. Blend well. Add the water and mix the dough for 2-3 minutes, until all the water is absorbed and evenly distributed. The dough will be damp and very sticky, but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the mixing. If they do, mix a few minutes more, or add a little more water and mix again. 2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes. Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsps. flour over the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and only slightly sticky. Add more flour if needed (e.g. in humid weather). Let the dough rest for 2 minutes more. 3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30 seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3 hours; the dough should almost triple in size. 4) Flour the top of the dough lightly, punch it down, and remove the dough from the mixing bowl. Form the dough into a rectangular loaf and place in a well greasad loaf pan, 9-1/4 in. by 5-1/4 in. by 2-3/4 in. Cover with a towel and let rise 1 hr., until nicely risen. 5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until browned on top; the bottom of the bread should sound hollow when tapped with the finger. Let the bread cool, then serve. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Whipping Cream</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons Unsalted Butter; Cut Into Pieces</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh Lemon Juice; (+ More As Needed)</li>
      <li>1 Clove Garlic (Small); Finely Minced</li>
      <li>Coarse Salt</li>
      <li>Freshly Ground White Pepper To Taste</li>
      <li>Cayenne Pepper To Taste</li>
      <li>1 pound Fresh Or Dried Linguine Or Tagliarini</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh Chives; Finely Minced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a medium saucepan, bring cream to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, to make a creamy sauce. Whisk in lemon juice and garlic. Taste, and season with salt, white pepper and cayenne. 2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the linguine and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes for fresh, 8 to 10 minutes for dried. Drain well. Return to the warm pot. 3. Add the warm sauce, chopped basil and chives. Toss well. Taste the sauce to check for an authoritative tang. Season with more lemon juice, salt, white pepper and cayenne as needed. 4. Using a carving fork with two long, straight tines, spear a serving of pasta onto the bottom tine. Place the pasta-entwined fork over a plate, and invert the fork, letting the pasta slide off into a neat stack. Repeat with the remaining pasta. Garnish with the whole basil leaves and serve immediately. NOTE: For a variation on the basil, use 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh tarragon and garnish with whole tarragon sprigs.

      <li>SERVES 6-8 James Brown, of Engine Company 81 in the Bronx, New York, won the contest with this dish. You can tell just by reading the recipe that this fireman knows his stuff. I can imagine the pleasure that Company 81 gets when this man turns on the fires . . . on his stove. He calls this dish "All Hands" because the line refers to that difficult situation in a fire when absolutely everyone is needed. I can tell you that all hands will show up when you cook this chicken dish. Officer Brown gives help to everyday cooks as when he points out that this dish "has the advantage of holding in heat in case of an alarm or they can sit for a while and be reheated." (At about six each evening, doesn't your house sound as if there is about to be a four-alarm fire?) You will enjoy this and it is not really difficult to make. I am not giving you his proportions, as they might seem a bit large for a family of four. So, cut down. I have already cut it in half! Using a heavy water glass or wooden mallet, pound each breast between 2 sheets of plastic until about double in area size but not torn. Heat a large frying pan and add the olive oil and garlic. Stir for a moment and add the spinach. Saut‚ the spinach until barely wilted. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cool and drain in a colander. Lay each chicken portion flat on the counter and salt and pepper to taste. Place 1/12 of spinach in a layer on each piece of chicken and add a bit of the cheese. Roll up and hold together with toothpicks. Mix the milk with the eggs and dip each piece into the egg wash and then dredge in the bread crumbs. Pan-fry in a bit of peanut oil until golden brown, turning once. Or deep-fry in oil at 375ø until golden brown. I really prefer these pan-fried. Remove the pieces to a pan and cover. Bake in a 350ø oven for 30 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the gravy. Drain the fat from the frying pan, leaving the scrapings in the pan. Heat the pan and add the butter and mushrooms. Saut‚ until tender and then stir in the flour, being careful to keep stirring as it thickens. We don't need lumps! Add the chicken stock, wine, and lemon juice. Cook until thickened, stirring with a wire whip. Check for seasoning of salt and pepper. Pour the gravy over the chicken rolls and serve with a parsley garnish. For a winner menu, serve this with Frittorta and Corn Oysters (see recipes). From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

      <li>submitted by: brendad@corp.cirrus.com This one is from San Jose, California, USA. My husband enjoys fishing. While on a fishing trip for Dorado (Mahi Mahi) to the Gulf of California, Sea of Cortez, he picked up this recipe from one of the local fishing guides. Mix all the above ingredients in deep dish. Marinate fish for one hour before grilling. Tastes very good on fresh Mahi Mahi or Ahi Tuna. Depending on your preference you can cut back on the salt. I prefer to cut back on the salt by at least half or not add it to the recipe. Try it full strength at least once, then decide.

      <li>1/2 cups Onion; sliced</li>
      <li>10 Cloves Garlic; sliced thin</li>
      <li>2 cups Carrots; sliced thin</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Corn oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Tumeric; ground</li>
      <li>1 Fresh hot green peppers; halved, to 3 peppers</li>
      <li>1 pound Cabbage; coarsely sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Queman; see note</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt; to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound Potatoes; cut like french</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Aleecha is a mixed vegetable stew. Quemam contains an ingredient not found in the US. I'd substitute dry berbere spice mix. In dry pan over moderate low heat, stir fry onion, garlic, and carrots for 2 mins. Add 1/2c of the water and cook 5 mins longer. Add the oil and continue to simmer. Add the tumeric, chilies, and cabbage. Cover the pan and steam to reduce the bulk for 2 mins. Stir well and add the quemam, tomato paste, salt and the potatoes. Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins. Add the remaining water and simmer for 5 minutes more to soften the potatoes and thicken the sauce somewhat. Serve at room temperature with Injeera.

      <li>haworth_pedro@prc.com phaworth@gmu.edu Yesterday I was digging through an old footlocker with memories and I came across a recipe that I was given by the cook at the boarding school where I studied in Barcelona. This stuff, as I remember, is really, really good on light colored meats, i.e. chicken, rabbit, pork, fish, etc. I translated it from Catalan (I was a little rusty) and initially came up with a really strange translation, but this is what I settled on: by Jordi Pijoan (he always reminded me of Einstein, but with a cleaver) Escola Internacional, Sta. Clara, Barcelona, Espana 1. In a mortar crush the four cloves of garlic to a pulp, seasoning them lightly with a pinch of salt. 2. Once they form a paste, with your *left* hand (that's what the recipe says) slowly drip olive oil into the mortar while with your right hand you continue stirring and crushing the mixture with the pestle, keeping in mind to always move the pestle in the same direction at a consistent pace. Continue this procedure until a fine paste, with good consistency, is formed. If for any reason the alioli does not thin (that is, if the paste does not become very fine), or if it becomes too light after it has been mixed, remove it from the mortar and place in it a piece of bread to soak up the excess oil. You then remove the bread and place the garlic back in the mortar and begin to *slowly* drip oil and mix in a consistent fashion. I remember making a batch several years ago where I also added a chiltepe, but I really can't remember how it turned out. I'm going to try it tonight and I'll let you guys know. Please feel free to experiment and please, please, post results, suggestions, etc.!!! CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

Mix the flour in well, and put into a greased lined loaf tin and bake for approximately 1 hour at 375F. Notes: The cake is delicious, and served in slices with a little margarine on. If you wrap it in foil and keep for a few days (if it lasts that long) the flavour gets even better. The all-bran is available in the UK as Kellogg's AllBran. It's sort of little sticks of high-fibre bran stuff. If you can't get it in the US, I don't know what the equivalent is (not having been to the US myself).

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Bobb1744@aol.com Date: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 21:37:02 -0500 Recipe By: Jo Anne Merrill 1. Cut beef roast into serving-sized portions. Use more beef if you need more than 6 servings. Brown beef in a bit of vegetable oil, although you can skip this step if rushed for time. 2. Slice onion and separate into rings. Dice the peeled carrots, dice the celery and slice the peppers into thin strips or circles. Place these into bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle the beef pieces with fresh ground black pepper, minced garlic and the onion soup mix. Place on top of the vegetables. 3. Mix the steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl with about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup tomato juice. Pour this over the meat. 4. Turn the crockpot to high for 30 minutes, or, if you're in a hurry, skip this step. Turn to low, cover and cook for 7-9 hours. Keep the crockpot covered as much as possible throughout cooking time. A crockpot can be used to cook this type of meal for a varied amount of time, depending on your schedule. It is not important that you take the meat and vegetables out at a specific amount of time. One or two hours either way usually makes no difference. When ready to serve, dip meat and vegetables out of pot with a slotted spoon. Use the liquid as is or turn crockpot to high and thicken liquid with a little flour or cornstarch. Serving Ideas : Serve with mashed potatoes and a healthy bread.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>SirWill1 &lt;SirWill1@omni.voicenet.com&gt; STEP 1: Put all ingredients in a large pot with a tablespoon or two of oil. Cook until browning just begins. STEP 2: Pour beer into blender and start a high speed vortex going. Keep it covered as you drop in first the ginger and garlic and get them good and liquefied, then add the peppers. Add more beer (or some of the juices from the vegetables you're cooking) if it gets too thick. When it's all nicely liquefied, pour it into the pot. Simmer an hour or so and give it a taste test. You might want to add a can of tomato paste, maybe a tsp of Kitchen Bouguet, or some herbs. I usually find myself tossing in a bit of allspice and cinnamon, maybe half a tsp of each, and sometimes some herbs (rosemary, sage, oregano, dill, even a little mint and/or fresh dill. I've also sliced scallions crosswise into little circles and added them late so they stay crisp and flavorful. Meat is optional. When I add meat I use about a half pound each of chopped sirloin and chopped turkey cooked together in a separate pot until well cooked, then I drain all the fat off in a colander and wash it down with hot water before adding it to the mix. Keeps the whole thing fairly low in fat. Another variation is to pour off and reserve the juices from the original pot of veggies before adding the blended chiles and use it for a soup starter. Let it simmer at least another two to three hours. Note -- no salt! Be good to your cardiovascular system! If there's something missing, try a little cumin or coriander or a bit more allspice and/or cinnamon! I use this as a spaghetti sauce or a topping for nachos. It lasts forever (I've kept it as long as three weeks) in the bottom of the fridge in tight tupperware containers and gets better with age. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>Alice Robertson, my next door neighbor, gave me this recipe in 1977 when we bought this house right next door to them. We immediately "took" to each other and we're now closer than sisters. Layer 2: Mix together and spread over layer 1, being sure you touch the sides of the bowl to "seal" it. Layer 3: Sprinkle over layer 2. Cover with saran wrap and refrigerate overnight. LAYER 4: Just before serving, add the following to the top of layer 3. To serve: Do not toss. Dig to the bottom to serve some of each of the four layers. This makes a lot, and is great for a make-ahead salad. It looks really pretty in a clear salad bowl so all the layers show through. This was one of my late mother-in-law's favorites.

    <title>All-American Pie Pastry</title>
    <category>Pies</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Frozen lard or shortening cut into bits</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Ice water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To ensure a tender crust, this recipe should not be doubled. Thoroughly freezing the lard or shortening will give you the flakiest crust. PLACE THE FLOUR AND SALT in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2-3 times. Scatter the lard or shortening over the flour mixture. Sprinkle with the water and process about 5 seconds or until dough just begins to form. Shape into a ball, then flatten it slightly. Dust lightly with flour and place in the center of a 2-gallon-size plastic storage bag. It may be refrigerated at this point up to 40 minutes. With the storage bag open and the dough circle centered in the bag, roll the dough into a circle that almost touches the edges of the bag. Cut and discard the top sheet of the plastic bag so that the dough is lying on the bottom sheet. Flip onto the pie plate; peel the plastic off and discard. Cut the pastry so it hangs about an inch over the rim. Lightly press the overhanging pastry under (between the pastry and the pie tin). Pinch or crease the edges of the pastry in a zigzag or fluted pattern. This is not only decorative, it also acts as a wall to keep the filling in. Yield: 1 single-crust 8- to 10-inch pie shell.

    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/3 cups (approximately) corn oil</li>
      <li>6 pounds Beef chuck; in 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>cups Minced onion</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Minced garlic</li>
      <li>3 cups (approximately) beef broth</li>
      <li>3 cups Flat beer</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/4 cups High-quality chili powder; or more, to taste</li>
      <li>6 pounds Tomatoes (three 2 lb. cans); drained and chopped</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Minced fresh oregano</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Cumin seed</li>
      <li>Salt; to taste</li>
      <li>Cayenne pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>Masa harina or cornmeal; if needed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the oil. Brown beef in batches, adding more oil as necessary and transferring meat with a slotted spoon to a large stockpot when well browned. Do not crowd skillet. 2. Reduce heat to moderately low. Add onion and garlic and saute until softened (about 10 minutes). Add to stockpot along with broth, beer, the water, chili powder, tomato, tomato paste, and oregano. 3. In a small skillet over low heat, toast cumin seed until fragrant; do not allow to burn. Grind in an electric minichopper or with a mortar and pestle. Add to stockpot. 4. Over high heat bring mixture to a simmer. Add salt, cayenne, and more chili powder to taste. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, partially covered, until beef is tender (about 1-1/2 hours). Check occasionally and add more broth if mixture seems dry. If chili is too thin when meat is tender, stir in up to 2 tablespoons masa harina. Cook an additional 5 minutes to thicken. Serve chili hot. NOTES : No Texan worth his or her ten-gallon hat would put beans in chili. This one's all beef, calling on beer and freshly ground cumin to give it distinction. Masa harina, the finely ground corn used for corn tortillas, is often used to thicken soups or chili. It is available in Latin markets and some supermarkets.

      <li>2 pounds Wheat malt</li>
      <li>1 pound Barley malt</li>
      <li>1 pound Dried malt extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 ounces Mt. Hood hops</li>
      <li>Wyeast Wheat beer yeast</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make a yeast starter two days beforehand. Mash the three pounds of malt a la Miller. Boil for one hour, adding 1-1/2 ounces hops at the start, 1/2 ounce at 30 minutes, and 1/2 ounce at 5 minutes. Cool and pitch yeast. Ferment. Bottle. I primed half the batch (5 gal) with 1/3 cup corn sugar and the other half with 1/2 cup clover honey. After two weeks, the beer was great. The beer primed with honey, however, was way too carbonated. All you can taste is bubbles. In direct taste tests, this beer has more body than WheatHook, and is slightly sweeter. Compared to EKU, the beer is similar, but EKU Wiezen is slightly sweeter.

      <li>1 pinch Ground allspice;(optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(Use favorite pastry) These turnovers are best with at least two varieties of firm cooking apples, such as Granny Smith, Jonathan, Winesap &amp; Golden Delicious, for differences in texture and acidity. Sweet spices optional. 1. Melt butter in a lg nonreactive skillet over mod. high heat. Add 2 c of diced apples &amp; cook, stirring frequently, 'til they begin to color, ab.5 min. Stir in cider, sugar, lemon ju &amp; salt; reduce heat to mod. &amp; cook 'til the liquid is reduced &amp; the apples appear almost dry but still retain their shape, about 5 min. longer. Remove skillet from heat &amp; stir in apple butter, currants, lemon zest, cinnamon, cloves &amp; allspice, along w remaining 1 c of raw chopped apple. Transfer apple mixture to a med. bowl &amp; refrigerate, uncovered, till cooled completely. 2. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry dough to an 18x20" rectangle, 1/16th inch thick. Using a 6" plate or bowl as a guide, cut out eight, 6"rounds as close together as possible. Gather and reroll the dough scraps, then cut out 2 additional rounds. 3. Spoon the cooled apple filling on the lower half of each of the rounds. Lightly moisten the edges of the rounds with water and fold the dough over the filling to form semicircular turnovers. Press down on the edges to seal, first with your fingers, then with the tines of a fork. Using back of a small knife, press into sealed edges at 1/2-inch intervals to create a scalloped effect. Transfer turnovers to a heavy baking sheet &amp; refrigerate at least 15 min. 4. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Brush turnovers w egg wash. Using a sharp knife, cut 2 small slits in top of each turnover to vent steam. 5. Bake turnovers in mid. of oven for 10 min.

      <li>Sticks (1/4 lb</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Milk</li>

      <li>Mix sugar and Crisco together. Heat milk until hot on finger. (Do not boil.) Add half of the milk to sugar ~ Crisco mixture and beat 2 minutes. Add rest of milk and beat 8 minutes longer (a total of 10 minutes all together). The beating breaks up the sugar granules to a whipped cream consistency, but is a butter type. To make a whipped cream frosting, use white Crisco instead of butter-flavored. (This is Audrey's (my sister-in-laws recipe.) (I use these often as I don't always have confectioners sugar on hand.)

      <li>Date: Sat, 17 Feb 1996 15:15:58 -0500 (EST) From: "Montiel Arredondo" &lt;arredon1@pilot.msu.edu&gt; Its snowing here in lovely *sarcasm rears its ugly head* Michigan, and I decided something warm is definitely in order. So, here goes something my mom used to make.. Albondigas: Soak bread in water, squeeze it dry, and mix with meat, egg, and seasonings. Shape meat into walnut-sized balls. Brown onion in 2T fat. Remove onion and reserve. Brown meatballs. After meat has browned, add reserved onion, tomato, more spices as above and cilantro to taste, and 4-6C boiling water. Simmer slowly for 1 1/2 hours. For Soup: Mash tomato through a sieve or in a blender. Bring to a boil in a large pan, adding enough water to make 2 quarts of liquid. Add chile pulp, salt and oregano. Boil down to about 3 pints liquid. Add albondigas, and simmer for about 1 hour. NOTE: we like anchos for this, but pasilla or other dried pepper soaked in hot (not boiling) water for about 30 minutes would work well. Discard water, and process till you get a nice paste. Any leftover can be frozen for later use. CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #243 From the Chile-Heads recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

      <li>2 pounds Pale malt (very light)</li>
      <li>2 pounds Vienna malt</li>
      <li>2 pounds Barley flakes</li>
      <li>1 pound Untyped malted barley</li>
      <li>8 ounces Roasted barley</li>

      <li>Wyeast German ale</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The flaked barley has no husk, so I saw no reason not to grind it finely. Mash in at 130 degrees. Let rest 20 minutes or so. Mash at 150 degrees for 115 minutes. Sparge. Let the spargings settle. What seemed to be 3 or 4" of hot break settled out of the initial spargings! Boil for 2 hours. Add hops as follows: 14 grams bullion and 16 grams cascade (very fresh) for 1:45. 10 g bullion and 14 g cascade for 1:05. 4 grams hallertauer finish. Chill with an immersion chiller, and strain the wort through the hops. Makes about 5.5 gallons of 1.068 wort. I had 374 out of 450 pt * gals of possible extraction, so an efficiency of about 85%.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Unsalted butter, chilled and</li>
      <li>Cut into bits</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Raspberry preserves (12 oz)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Soft butter</li>
      <li>2 cups Confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Cold water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the chilled butter, 3 cups of the flour and the sugar and, with your fingertips, rub until the mixture resembles flakes of coarse meal. Beat in the egg and continue to mix until the pastry is smooth. Shape it into a ball, wrap it in wax paper, and refrigerate 1 hour, or until the dough is form. With the back of a spoon, rub the preserves through a fine sieve set over a 1-quart saucepan, then cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they thicken into a thin puree. Set aside off the heat. Preheat the oven to 250F. Cut the chilled pastry in half and shape each half into a rectangle. One half at a time, roll the pastry between two sheets of lightly floured wax paper into a rectangle approximately 10 inches wide and 15 inches long. With a pastry brush, coat each of 2 cookie sheets with 1 tablespoon of butter and sprinkle them with flour, tipping the sheets from side to side to coat them evenly. Then invert the sheets and tap them against a hard surface to dislodge any excess flour. Peel off the top sheets of wax paper and use the bottom ones to lift the 2 rectangles of pastry onto the 2 cookie sheets. Peel off the remaining sheets of wax paper. Bake 40 minutes, or until the pastry begins to turn a pale gold. Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly. With a metal spatula, spread the raspberry puree evenly over one sheet of the pastry, covering it completely and smoothly. Slide the second sheet of pastry gently onto the first. With a spoon stir the sugar, water and lemon juice together in a large mixing bowl to form a thin paste. Spread the icing over the top layer of pastry with the spatula, and set the cake aside to cool to room temperature. With a small, sharp knife or pastry wheel, slice the Aleksander Torte into strips 1 inch wide and 2 inches long, cutting the ends on the diagonal.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 12 cup bundt or angel food cake pan. Beat all ingredients in a large bowl on low speed, scraping bowl constantly, 1 minute. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally, for 2 more minutes. Pour into prepared pan and bake 40-45 minutes, until a wooden pick comes out clean. Cool 15 minutes before removing from pan. Decorate with frosting, or make a glaze of 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp milk or cream, liqueur to thin. I'd say that you could use a chocolate cake mix, kahlua or bailey's instead of amaretto, then melt a half cup of chocolate chips, 2-3 Tbsp butter and maybe a bit of milk or cream, as needed to thin, and drizzle that over the top, and it'd look like you spent hours in the kitchen. I &gt;know&lt; that this recipe tastes good enough that you need super sensitive taste buds to know it started with a mix. Don't ruin it with a commercial frosting, though. There's absolutely no possible way to disguise &gt;that&lt; flavor. Recipe By: Antoinette Hartman Serving Size: 12 * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627.

      <li>From: 21329KAD@msu.edu (Kim Dyer) Date: Thu, 10 Aug 1995 16:54:06 GMT (A multitude of variations possible ... amaretto, chocolate, grand marnier, etc.) A food processor makes this whole thing VERY easy. You just toss stuff in and blend. You can make it without one, but it is more work. A spring form pan will give you a pretty cake. But it tastes just as good baked in a regular cake pan and served a little on the mangled side. crust: Toss it all in a food processor and blend. Crumbs should stick together. If they don't, add a little more melted butter. Pack into bottom and up the sides of a springform pan filling: Once again, toss it all in a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour into the prepared crust. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees ... or until filling is firm and top is golden brown. When cake is cooled you can add topping. Topping: Like before ... toss it all in a food processor, and go at it. Pour on cake. Chill for about an hour so it sets up nice. Put the cake on your serving plate and remove the springform pan. If you want to be really decadent, pour a can of prepared cherry pie filling over the whole thing just before serving. Serve with bedraggled but proud look, and tell all your friends the effort involved is worth it for the look on their faces. ;-) CAUTION: Once people try this, they MAY keep asking you to make them one.

    <category>Italian</category>
    <quantity>42</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Canned almond paste</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>2 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>Granulated sugar for dusting</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375F. Break the almond paste into small pieces and combine it with the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mix on low speed until very fine. Add egg whites in 4 additions, mixing about 1 minute between each. Beat the paste until very smooth, about 2-to-3 minutes. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tube with the mixture. Line 2 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment paper. Pipe the mixture on the paper in 1-to-1 1/2-inch mounds, about 1-inch apart. Fold a clean kitchen towel into a long strip and moisten the towel with water. Squeeze lightly to eliminate excess water, leaving the towel more than damp. Slap the surface of the Amaretti gently with the towel to moisten them and make the surface smooth. Sprinkle the Amaretti with granulated sugar. Bake about 15-to-20 minutes, until they are well risen, a deep golden color, and their surface is covered with tiny cracks. Remove from the oven and place the pans on racks to cool. To remove the Amaretti from the papers, turn the papers over with the Amaretti still adhering to them and wet the papers with hot water, using a brush. Leave a few minutes, then pull on the papers to release the Amaretti. HERE ARE 2 VARIATIONS OF AMARETTI: Amaretti di Pinoli: After moistening the piped Amaretti, strew them with pine nuts, sprinkling them on heavily, then pressing lightly with the fingertips so that the pine nuts adhere. Do not dust with sugar. Bake as for the Amaretti. Fior di Mandorla: This variation of Amaretti is popular in Southern Italy and Sicily, where the mixture is sometimes colored green or pink during the mixing. Their rough, craggy appearance is a nice contrast to the smoothness of the standard Amaretti. Prepare the Amaretti, up to, and including, moistening them with the towel. Dust heavily with confectioners' sugar and allow the piped mixture to dry at room temperature, uncovered, at least 12 hours, or overnight. After they have dried, indent each of the piped mounds with the thumb, first and middle fingers of one hand, positioning them equidistant around the circumference, and pinching gently inward, about half way into the center. Bake the Fior di Mandorla at 375F, about 15-to-20 minutes. Cool and loosen the Fior di Mandorla as for the Amaretti. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <category>Usenet</category>
    <quantity>16</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CRUST</li>
      <li>7 ounces Amaretti (see note)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Sweet butter</li>
      <li>1 ounce Chocolate, unsweetened (1 square)</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>6 ounces Chocolate, semisweet</li>
      <li>7 ounces Amaretti</li>
      <li>4 ounces Almond paste</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Amaretto liqueur</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar, granulated</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Cream cheese (room temperature)</li>
      <li>4 large Eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Heavy cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>MAKE CRUST: Butter the sides only (not the bottom) of a 9-inch spring-form pan (about 2 1/2 to 3 inches deep). Grind the Amaretti very fine in a food processor or blender. Mix with sugar in a mixing bowl. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler, stirring occasionally. Add the melted mixture to the Amaretti crumbs and sugar and mix thoroughly. (Don't wash the double boiler; you'll be using it again in a minute.) Turn the mixture into the prepared pan. With your fingers, distribute it evenly over the bottom and press it down into a very firm, compact layer. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling. MAKE FILLING: Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Partially melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler, then uncover and stir until completely melted. Remove the top of the double boiler and set aside to cool. Break the Amaretti coarsely into a bowl and set aside. Cut the almond paste into small pieces, and beat on low speed with an electric mixer, while gradually adding the Amaretto liqueur. Beat until thoroughly mixed and set aside. Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar and beat until smooth again. Add the almond paste-Amaretto mixture and beat until thoroughly mixed. Add the melted chocolate and beat well again. Add the eggs one at a time, beating at low speed until they are incorporated after each addition. Add the heavy cream and beat until smooth. Add the coarsely broken Amaretti and stir gently only to mix. Turn into the prepared pan, pouring the mixture over the bottom crust. Rotate the pan gently to level the batter. (Don't worry if the mixture comes almost to the top; it won't run over.) Bake 45 minutes. It will seem soft and not done, but don't bake any more; it will become firm when chilled. The top of the cake is supposed to look bumpy because of the large chunks of Amaretti. Let cool completely at room temperature, then carefully remove the sides of the pan and refrigerate the cake (still on the bottom of the pan) for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight. NOTES: * This is adapted from Maida Heatter's "Book of Great Chocolate Desserts," (Knopf 1980). It won me a blue ribbon at the Martha's Vineyard Agricultural Exhibition and Fair in 1983. If you ever find yourself in front of a firing squad, this makes an unbeatable last request. * Amaretti are Italian almond-flavored wafer cookies. They are usually sold in metal tins with the wafers wrapped in packages of two inside the tin. You can also buy Amarettini, which are the same flavor but much smaller and not individually wrapped. Since you're going to grind some of the wafers and break the others into chunks, it doesn't matter which size you start with. One brand is Amaretti di Saronna, Lazzaroni &amp; Co. * This is an expensive cake, both in terms of the cost of the ingredients ($15-$20) and the number of calories. : Difficulty: moderate to hard. : Time: 30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking, overnight cooling. : Precision: measure ingredients carefully. : Jan Wolitzky : AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA : ihnp4!mhuxd!wolit : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Butter</li>
      <li>2 cups Buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup Boiling water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(Adapted from Hodgson Mill wheat bran box) "These muffins are mixed, stored in the refirigerator and baked whenever they are wanted. When preparing to back, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Stir batter weel and spoon into buttered muffin tins, filling 2/3 full. Bake 20-22 minutes and serve. You can make 2 muffins or enough for a large family." Combine 1 C bran and 1 C boiling water, stir and let steep. In a separate bowl, cream sugar and butter. Beat eggs. Combine the flour, soda and salt. Combine the 1 C of steeped bran with remaining 2 C of bran, the eggs, flour mixture and buttermilk, butter and sugar. Mix. Store in tightly covered container (non-metallic). Let stand at least 12 hours before baking. Batter will keep in refrigerator for 6 weeks. Chemical action will cause the batter to turn dark on top. No problem, just stir before using. Note: I never had enough batter around to last more than 2 or 3 days. Six weeks seems mighty long to me. But these are delicious!

      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Almond extract</li>

      <li>6 drops Red food coloring</li>
      <li>2 drops Blue food coloring</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Glycerin</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipie looks very similar to one found in: "Classic Liqueurs; The Art of Making and Cooking with Liqueurs" by Cheryl Long and Heather Kibbey. Combine sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer until all sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and cool. In an aging container, combine apricot halves, almond extract, grain alcohol with 1/2 cup water, and brandy. Stir in cooled sugar syrup mixture. Cap and let age for 2 days. Remove apricot halves. (Save apricot halves, as they may be used for cooking). Add food coloring and glycerin. Stir, recap and continue aging for 1 to 2 months. Re-bottle as desired. Liqueur is ready to serve but will continue to improve with additional aging. Variation: For a more prominent 'bitter almond' flavor, add 4 apricot nuts,** split in half, to basic mixture. Leave in for 2 days to 2 weeks depending upon depth of flavor desired. Remove and discard apricot nuts. Continue as directed. **Note: Apricot 'nuts' come from within the apricot pit. You may split pits yourself or obtain them dried at a health food store. TREY@BIG-BIRD.CS.BERKELEY.EDU (MACDONALD JACKSON) REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

Put 1 c of the wheat bran in a small bowl. Add the boiling water, stir once and let stand to soften. Cream the margarine and sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat the eggs slightly and add to the margarine mixture, mixing well. Combine the flour soda and salt in a mixing bowl. Combine the wheat bran, the softened bran, and the flour mixture, and then combine with the egg/margarine/sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Stir until thoroughly mixed. Pour into a plastic container with a tight lid. Store in the refrigerator for a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 6 weeks. Makes 2 dozen. These muffins are made, stored in the refrigerator, and baked whenever they are wanted. About 25 minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spoon the batter into teflon-lined or buttered muffin tins, filling them 2/3 full. Bake 18 minutes and serve. I like to add rasins and pecans to the muffin tins before cooking.

In a separate a bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Gradually beat in the granulated sugar until stiff. Fold in the lemon zest and almond extract. Pipe the mixture with a pastry bag using a round 1/4-inch tip into 1 1/2-inch rounds onto baking sheets lined with lightly buttered waxed paper or parchment. Bake in a preheated 275-degree oven for 1 hour, checking to make sure the amaretti don't brown. Turn off the oven and let the amaretti dry out for an additional hour--they should be very crisp. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer.

      <li>1/4 cups Nuts; finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar, confectioners'</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>24 ounces Cream cheese; softened</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>4 large Egg; room temp</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Amaretto</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: TOPPING</li>
      <li>2 cups Sour cream; room temp</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Amaretto</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Almonds, toasted sliced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375-F. Lightly butter the bottom and side of a 9 x 3" round springform pan. Trim a 9" cardboard cake circle so that it fits snugly within the curved lip of the bottom of the springform pan. Cover the top of the cardboard lined springform bottom with a piece of aluminum foil, leaving a 2" overhang all the way around the edge. Carefully attach the side of the springform so as not to tear the foil. Wrap the foil overhang halfway up the side of the springform pan. Lightly butter the foil covered bottom and side of the springform pan. In the top of a double boiler over hot, not simmering, water, melt the chocolate chips with the butter, stirring frequently, until smooth. Remove the top part of the double boiler from the bottom and cool the chocolate mixture until tepid. In a large bowl, stir together the crumbs, nuts and sugar until combined. Add the chocolate mixture and using a fork, stir together the chocolate and crumbs, until combined. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan, making sure that the crust extends 1" up the side of the pan. Set aside. Make the filling: In a large bowl, using a hand held electric mixer set at medium high speed, beat the cream cheese with the sugar for 2 to 3 minutes, or until smooth. One at a time, beat in the eggs, beating well after each addition. Beat in the liqueur, cornstarch and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the chocolate chips. Pour the cheesecake filling into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with a rubber spatula. Bake the cheesecake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean when inserted near the center. Cool for 5 minutes. Do not turn off the oven. Make the topping: In a large bowl, stir together the sour cream, sugar and liqueur until combined and spread it evenly over the surface of the cake. Bake for 5 minutes longer. Cool the cheesecake completely on a wire rack. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Remove the side of the pan and sprinkle the top with the almonds.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Pecans, chopped finely</li>
      <li>2 cups Confectioner's sugar, sifted</li>
      <li>2 cups Chocolate wafer crumbs</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Amaretto</li>
      <li>Pecans, additional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Process pecans and wafers separately; combine in food processor with sugar. SLOWLY pour in liqueur until mixture forms a ball. You might not need the whole amount, depending on the humidity level. (If mixture gets too wet, put it in the refrigerator -- uncovered -- overnight to dry out some.) Shape into small balls; roll in additional finely chopped pecans. Store in tightly sealed container. Yield: Not nearly enough. Vicki's notes: * One Christmas Eve I had to work, but I took a break to pop in a bookstore. They were having an open house, and I managed to snarf a lot of these morsels during those stolen minutes! After Christmas I came back to hunt down the clerk who brought these -- my finest bit of sleuthing yet... * These are equally enjoyed and requested by my friends. Although some have tried other liqueurs -- including bourbon -- the results are never as good as the original! * I substitute Oreos for the wafers, plus use only 1 1/3 C confec sugar; don't worry about the cookies' filling because it is nothing more than confec sugar.

      <li>From: christi@meaddata.com (Christi Wilson) Date: 4 Aug 1994 20:44:26 -0400 From The Toronto Star, February 3, 1993. Base: In 9-inch microwavable quiche dish, shallow round baking dish or deep pie plate, melt butter at high (100 per cent power) 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in almonds and sugar until evenly coated with butter. Press into bottom and sides of dish. Microwave at high 2 to 3 minutes or until firm. If necessary, rotate dish during cooking. Filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar until light. Beat in eggs one at a time. Add sour cream, 2 tablespoons Amaretto or almond liqueur, vanilla and almond extract. Beat until smooth. Pour into baked crust. Microwave uncovered at medium (50 per cent power) 14 to 18 minutes or until cheesecake is almost set in centre. Rotate dish partway through cooking, if necessary. Cool on countertop to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until serving time. Sauce: Reserve some whole raspberries for garnish. Puree remaining raspberries. Push through sieve to remove seeds. Stir 2 tablespoons Amaretto or almond liqueur into puree. Add sugar to taste. To serve, spoon some sauce on to dessert plates. Place slice of cheesecake on sauce. Garnish with reserved berries. Makes 6 to 8 servings. If you prefer, use 1 cup graham cracker crumbs with 1/2 cup finely chopped almonds for the crust. Use a food processor and pulse to chop nuts to an even consistency, rather than a fine powder. Also, you could substitute strawberries for the raspberries. To omit liqueur, increase almond extract in the filling to 1 teaspoon and use just a drop in the raspberry puree. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou. Celebrations: Holiday Brunch: Celebrations is a class that shows you how to have a dining event that not only tastes good and looks good but is generally enjoyable. Fitting with the holiday season, we worked on a holiday brunch. Aside from these recipes, we learned about table presentation, planning and tricks to make the event memorable. We also created several types of food related decorations. In a large bowl combine all the ingredients. Tie 1-tablespoon batches of the mix in cheese cloth or muslin bags and tie with string. As decoration, you can tie a stick of cinnamon to the outside of the bag. One bag makes enough to flavor 1 quart of cider. To make mulled cider, put the bag in a pot with 1 quart of cider. Bring to a slow boil and simmer for 20 minutes, covered. A 1/4 cup of rum may be added to spice it up a bit more.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine syrup, hot water and butter and bring to a boil. Mix cornstarch, salt and enough cold water to make a thin paste, add egg yolks and beat well. Add cornstarch mixture to hot syrup gradually, return to heat and cook until thickened to the consistency of pudding, stirring constantly. Cool slightly. Pour into pie crust. Beat egg whites stiff, adding slowly the tablespoon of syrup. Pile on pie and brown in 400 F oven. Notes: The filling never thickened enough. Anything less than pudding consistency just doesn't work.

We still need to get the consistency of the filling right, but I think it may just be a matter of more corn starch. * From the Polka Dot Cottage, 1-201-822-3627, NJ's BBS for Homemakers!

      <li>Pats comments.... "This bread is really good. It can be used on the timer. On my Panasonic I use the regular cycle, but with the light crust due to all the juices in it. Makes a beautiful high rising loaf with a warm cinnamon color. Definitely use the vital gluten as it rises much better. I use frozen apple juice concentrate. You could also add raisins or chopped apples, either fresh or dried, or even nuts might be nice. Fits McD beautifully, don't you think?!"

If using dried chipotles, soak them in 1/2 cup warm apple juice for 30 minutes, then remove the stems and mince the chilies. If using canned chipotles, mince them. For a milder jelly, you can remove the seeds. 2. Combine the sugar, remaining apple juice, vinegar, and chipotles in a large heavy saucepan and stir to mix. Simmer the mixture over medium heat, stirring gently, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface. 3. Stir in the dry and liquid pectins and boil for 2 minutes. Skim well. Pour the mixture into sterile jelly jars (three 1-pint jars or six 1-cup jars) and cover tightly. Invert the jars for 10 minutes, then reinvert. Shake the jars from time to time as the jelly cools, to evenly distribute the pepper pieces. The jelly will keep for several months in a cool, dark place, unopened. Refrigerate it, once it is opened.

      <li>From: pasquale@lanl.gov (Gina Pasquale) Date: 21 Apr 1994 19:04:51 -0400 I have enjoyed this newsgroup immensely. I've gotten so many good recipes from postings that I thought I'd post one of my favorites. This came from a newspaper many years ago, and I always get compliments when I make it. Beat eggs until light &amp; fluffy. Gradually add in sugar, oil &amp; vanilla. Sift together flour, salt, soda, cinnamon &amp; nutmeg (I don't sift, just mix); add to first mixture. Stir in apples &amp; walnuts. Place in greased 9x13" pan. Bake in 350 deg. oven for 45 min. or until center springs back when touched. Allow to cool in pan on a rack for 15 min; spread with Cream Cheese Frosting (recipe follows). CREAM CHEESE FROSTING: Beat cream cheese and butter together. Add vanilla and beat. Gradually beat in powdered sugar until smooth. Note: Both cake and frosting freeze well. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CAKES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>I can't remember who was asking for baked doughnuts (sorry!), but here is the recipe I have. It came from Eating Well. I found this a little too sweet, so now I skip or halve the glaze. I've also tried this using artificial sweetener and the texture is fine. Use a 6-cake minibundt pan or a regular bundt pan. For minibundt pan, oven 400 degrees cook 10 to 12 minutes. For regular bundt pan, oven 375 and cook 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat oven and prepare pan by coating it with nonstick spray and a light dusting of granulated sugar. Mix flour, baking powder, soda, salt, cinnamon. Set aside. In another bowl, mix egg, brown sugar, apple butter, syrup, cider, yogurt, and oil. Add dry ingredients and stir until just moistened. Use about two generous tablespoons per minibundt cup - makes twelve. Dip shaped side of "doughnuts" in glaze to coat. Each (or 1/12 of coffee cake): 252 cal, 3 g protein, 4 g fat, 52 g carbohydrates, 255 mg sodium, 18 mg cholesterol Maple Glaze: Mix. Use as directed above.

      <li>Date: Mon, 18 Mar 1996 18:03:34 -0500 From: kmeade@ids2.idsonline.com (The Meades) Recipe By: Mollie Katzen 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously oil a 9-inch square pan &amp; dust with flour. 2. Place the egg whites in a large bowl, and beat with an electric mixer at high speed until they form sturdy peaks. 3. In another large bowl, combine apples with all remaining ingredients (including optional nuts &amp; cranberries) &amp; mix well. 4. Use a rubber spatula to fold the beaten egg white into the apple mixture until fairly well combined. Transfer to the prepared pan, and bake about 30 minutes - until a probe comes out clean. Cool before slicing. Serve plain or dusted with powdered sugar. NOTES: As its name suggests, this cake is very light &amp; fluffy, thanks to the presence of 8 beaten egg whites (&amp; the absence of egg yolks, butter, oil or dairy products). A few tips: 1. Separate the eggs when cold, then let the whites come to room temperature before beating them. 2. You can grate the apples in a food processor with the grating attachment. 3. Be generous when you oil &amp; flour the pan. This cake has a tendency to stick. 4. If you can't bring yourself to throw out the egg yolks, save them to brush over bread (I buy the litre containers of egg whites at the supermarket, so there's no waste., stimps).

    <ingredient>

      <li>2 cups Frozen vegetables (your choice) Add-ins -</li>
      <li>1 Chopped onion 3 minced cloves garlic frozen pearl onions minced shallots sliced leeks (1 bunch) (any of these will add a sharper taste to the casserole. Use them all you want!) Sauce:</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Milk OR</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk AND 2 c sharp grated cheese salt and pepper to taste Nutmeg, for cheese sauce curry powder, if you add sherry, white wine, or vermouth, no more than 1/4 c. Other optional seasonings: Italian Seasoning Cajun Seasoning</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Take the pasta or rice, the meat, and the veggies, and dump them into a 9x9 baking dish. Make the sauce by melting the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. If you want to saute the onions or garlic or whatever add-in you're using, use one more Tbsp butter. Add the flour and stir until completely mixed into a thick paste. Add the milk and slowly bring to a boil. Lower heat and cook just until thick. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Remove the sauce from the heat. Add cheese if making a cheese sauce. Stir until melted. Add desired seasonings to taste. Pour over top of casserole mixture and stir gently until mixed well. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Let stand about 10 minutes before serving. This is a great way to use up leftovers, and it's different every time you make it because you improvise. Very easy, too, and it freezes well as long as you're not using a very hard cheese (hard cheeses will separate and the oil will float to the top. Use a breadcrumb topping if you've got a craving for Jarlsberg or Gruyere or Parmesan.) * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627 Posted by FAYLEN Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #703 by Lisa Clarke &lt;lisa@gaf.com&gt; on Aug 1, 9</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>There are of course nearly as many salsa recipes as there are chile-heads, but here are a few comments and a basic recipe. 1. There's a huge difference between cooked and fresh salsas. Canned tomatoes are cooked. I think you're interested in a basic fresh salsa; you can go from there into a variety of red and green fresh and cooked salsas. 2. I don't much like tomatoes, fresh or otherwise - basically the only food I don't like - so if preparing just for myself I leave them out. When preparing salsa to share with others, I use under-ripe tomatoes, and sparingly. Just my taste, but it seems to run in our family. 3. No need for sugar. No way of knowing what "2 green and 1 red chilli" means. No problem with some fresh white onion and some coriander (cilantro). Scallions are okay too, but are a bit of a variation. Garlic - matter of taste; it's a strong flavor. 4. A fresh Mexican salsa, often called "pico de gallo," will usually include the following, so this might be considered a basic recipe: 1 fresh, not too ripe tomato, diced fine 1 Maui or other sweet onion, diced fine Cilantro to taste - maybe 2 tablespoons 2 fresh jalapeno or serrano chiles, diced fine - more to taste juice of 2 limes or a lemon Stir well, keep chilled and covered until you serve it, and use within 24 hours (the tomato will start to get weird on you after that). Adding some small cubes or hunks of ripe avocado right before serving is a good variation. Will &lt;wdborgeson@ucdavis.edu&gt; CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

Set the oven control at broil/or 550 degrees F. Broil the slices with the tops 3 to 4 inches from the heat for 5 minutes. Spread the potatoes on the slices and sprinkle with shredded Cheddar cheese. Broil until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes and serve hot. SOUPED-UP MEAT LOAF: For four 1/2-inch slices of meat loaf, mix 1/2 to 1 can of your favorite condensed cream soup, such as cream of mushroom, (10 3/4 oz size) and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of milk in a skillet. Heat to boiling, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat and place the slices in the skilled, turning to coat all sides with the sauce.

      <li>Tatum writes: "The young, tender, tightly curled fronds - croziers or fiddleheads - of bracken (or brake ferns) and of ostrich and cinnamon ferns are all prepared in the same way. "Rub off the fuzz (or, for some ferns, the scaly coating) of the young, crisp fronds, wash them and place them, lying flat, in a saucepan or skillet with a small amount of boiling salted water. Bring water again to a boil. Turn to low heat, cover and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes, or until fronds are just tender (time will depend on the size and kind of fronds)."

    <title>Basic Fondue</title>
    <category>Appetizers</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/2 fluid ounces Dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic</li>
      <li>5 1/2 ounces Emmental and Gruyere cheese; grated and, mixed half-and-half</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/2 fluid ounces Kirsch</li>
      <li>1 dash Pepper</li>
      <li>1 Grind fresh nutmeg</li>
      <li>6 ounces Sliced French bread;, cubed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The above measurements are for one person. Multiply by your number of guests. In Switzerland, fondue is usually prepared in a "caquelon," and earthenware dish with a handle, glazed inside. If you do not have a fondue pot with stand and Sterno heat source, use an enameled saucepan, or not-too-shallow fire proof dish. Rub the inside of the pan with half a cut clove of garlic and let it dry until the rubbed places feel tacky. Put the wine in the dish and bring it to a boil. Slowly start adding cheese to the boiling wine, stirring constantly until each bit is dissolved before adding the next. When all the cheese is in, reduce heat. In a small dish, combine the Kirsh and cornstarch, stirring well; add to the cheese mixture and keep stirring over heat until the mixture comes to a boil again. Add freshly ground pepper and nutmeg to taste. Remove the dish to the stand and light Sterno. The fondue should remain bubbling slowly. Provide each guest with a fondue fork or bamboo skewer. Guests then proceed to spear a bread cube and stir it around in the cheese and then eat it. NOTES : The old custom is that, if you are a male and you lose the cube in the dish, you must buy a round of drinks for the table; if female, you must kiss everybody. Other lore: Do not drink water with fondue; it reacts unkindly in your stomach with the cheese and bread. Dry white wine and tea are the usual accompaniments. Another tradition: the "coupe d'midi" or "shot in the middle", for when you get full. A thimbleful of Kirsch, knocked straight back in the middle of the meal usually produces more room if you're feeling too full. The crusty bit that forms at the bottom of the pot as the cheese keeps cooking is called the "crouton" and is very nice peeled off and divvied up among the guests as a sort of farewell to dinner.

Pour the warm granola back into the mixing bowl and gently fold in dried fruit. When cool, store in an airtight container. That's the basic recipe, but it's easy to modify. Here are things I substitute or add: honey, nutmeg, maple syrup, Smuckers syrup, amaranth seeds, oat bran, rye flakes, craisins, dried apricots. Here are a few baking tricks: * Don't overcook it. You'll end up with a pan-o-pebbles. Bake only until "al dente". * It's less messy (with all that stirring) to use a pan with high sides. * zip lock bags make good storage containers.

Slowly start adding cheese to the boiling wine, and stir constantly until each bit is dissolved, then add more. When all the cheese is in, stir the kirsch into the cornstarch well, then add the mixture to the cheese and keep stirring over the heat until the mixture comes to a boil again. Add freshly ground pepper and nutmeg to taste. -- Remove the dish to on top of a small live flame (Sterno or alcohol burner) and keep it bubbling slowly. Bread should have been cubed ~- about 1-inch cubes -- for spearing with fondue forks and stirring around in the cheese. The old custom is that if you accidentally lose the bread into the cheese from the end of your fork, if you're male, you have to buy a round of drinks for the table: if you're female, you have to kiss everybody. (Hmm.) . Other fondue info: Do not drink water with fondue -- it reacts unkindly in your stomach with the cheese and bread. Dry white wine or tea are the usual accompaniments. Another tradition: the "coupe d'midi", or "shot in the middle", for when you get full: a thimbleful of Kirsch, knocked straight back in the middle of the meal, usually magically produces more room if you're feeling too full. Don't ask me how this works...it just does. -- The crusty bit that forms at the bottom of the pot as the cheese keeps cooking is called the "crouton", and is very nice peeled off and divvied up among the guests as a sort of farewell to dinner.

      <li>From: albersa@aztec.asu.edu (ANN ALBERS) Date: 31 May 1995 05:20:19 -0600 Here's a yummy focaccia recipe from my local paper. It's lighter in texture, and less flat than some recipes, but tasty nonetheless: For the sponge: Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large mixing bowl. Whisk it in and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in flour. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand until bubbly and doubled in volume, about 45 minutes. For the dough, sprinkle yeast over warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 5-10 minutes. With a wooden spoon, stir the yeast mixture and the olive oil into the sponge and mix well. Stir in 1 c of the flour and the salt. Stir in enough remaining flour to produce a soft dough. Knead on a lightly floured board until soft and smooth, about 6-8 minutes. Place dough in a lighly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled 1 to 1 14/ hrs or overnight in the fridge. Divide dough in half and press into two lightly oiled 9" round cake pans. If dough shrinks from the sides, let rest a few minutes then stretch it again. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes or until dough is full of air bubbles. Just before baking, press your fingertips deep into the dough all over the surface to dimple the loaf. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake at 425 deg. for 20-25 minutes until top is golden. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>This airy, crusty, loaf is perfect sandwich bread fro tuna fish, peanut butter or lettuce and tomato. If you don't slice it too thick, it will even fit into a low-calorie diet. Since this recipe has no shortening, the bread will turn stale, after only one day, but it will still make fine toast, especially good for a fried egg sandwich. Variation I used: Decreased the bread flour to 2 1/2 C and added 1/2 C yellow cornmeal. Added 2 T sesame seeds It really made it a totally different bread.

The Seed of a Bright Idea By JOHN ASH The most basic of mustards is simply a mixture of mustard powder and water. This recipe has a little more going for it. Remember that most homemade mustards tend to be a bit more runny and more pungent than commercially made, but that's their charm. Also, homemade mustard needs to mature at least a day, and preferably longer, before being used. When it's first made, the flavor will be almost unpleasant. Coarsely grind yellow and brown mustard seeds in spice grinder or coffee mill. Mix together with mustard powder and water. Allow mixture to stand at least 1 hour. Stir in vinegar, brown sugar and salt. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 day before using. 1 cup.

    <category>Breakfast</category>
    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cream</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine eggs, milk, and salt in bowl. Beat gently. Place butter in skillet and heat until butter is very slightly browned. Add eggs and immediately stir them briskly with back of fork. When the eggs have thickened and there are no more liquid eggs in skillet, stop stirring and continue cooking for a few seconds, gently shaking the pan back and forth over the heat. Take skillet off fire and with fork fold one-third of omelet over center. Then fold other third over first. Slide omelet onto heated serving dish. COMMENTS French omelets are famous for their smoothness and lightness. This is because the eggs are cooked very quickly and remain moist -- as they should. Once the butter is hot, it does not take more than two minutes to make the omelet itself. There is in every French household an "omelet skillet," used only for that purpose. It is a cast iron or heavy aluminum skillet, approximately 9-inches across. It is never washed but is carefully wiped after each use with paper towels. If it becomes necessary to wash it, it is scoured with a scouring pad, then oiled and wiped with paper. Some omelet skillets are larger for bigger omelets, but it is never advisable to make an omelet of more than 4 eggs. It is much easier to cook two 3-egg omelets than a 6-egg one. The eggs should be taken out of the refrigerator one hour before cooking. They are beaten lightly, just enough to break them and blend the whites and yolks together. This is done at the last minute. The one essential factor in the successful making of an omelet is the temperature of the butter. The eggs are not poured into the skillet until the butter bubbles and turns "noisette" (hazelnut), that is, slightly brown. Then the eggs are turned into the skillet and the omelet is briskly made. Many cooks, just before serving, rub a piece of butter over the top of the omelet to give it a "shine," which does not make it any better but does make it more appetizing.

      <li>basic Lebanese aoili (garlic dressing) doesn't use egg for its base but will still achieve the "mayo" consistancy - needless to say, for lo-fat use less oil or substitute with one of the "better" oils - the original recipe given to me called for putting the raw garlic in a blender &amp; pureeing it until you had a smooth paste, then a little lemon juice &amp; pepper, then slowly add oil (while the blender's running) - this will result in a consistency so we can take your basic recipe : 1 head roasted garlic - add some fresh garlic cloves for more flavor blend till garlic is smooth paste then add 1 tsp Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, fresh ground pepper to tste. turn blender on &amp; add 2 TBS olive oil, 1/4 cup unsalted chicken broth, 1/4 cup wine vinegar - try balsamic vinegar instead for more flavor &amp; zest.

      <li>2 quarts Cold water</li>
      <li>8 cups Vegetables; cut into 1" pieces</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>First choose the ingredients to reflect the soup in which the broth is being used. A general guideline for making vegetable broth is to use about 8 to 12 cups of vegetables cut into pieces no bigger than 1 inch. Put these with 2 quarts of cold water in a large nonreactive pot with no more than six different herbs. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Strain and use as is or concentarte the flavor by simmering to the desired strength (by taste). When using dried herbs, lessen quantities by one-half to two-thirds but always add *to taste* vegetable: carrots, celery, potatoes, winter squash, summer squash, chard, kale, tomatoes, mushrooms, eggplant, lettuce, green beans, celeriac When available use: fennel bulbs, asparagus, peas herbs (limit 6): basil, bay, borage, garlic, garlic chives, hyssop, lovage, morjoram, oregano, parsley, sage, savory, thyme spices (limit 2) coriander, cumin, cardamon, fennel seeds, whole cloves, cinnamon Reprinted in Maggie Oster's Herb Garden (1993:36) NY: MacMillan Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #198 Date: Wed, 14 Aug 1996 15:01:20 -0700 (PDT) From: PatH &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; NOTES : Stock is very personal. It's quickly prepared. Or make ahead and= freeze in a size that's convenient for you. -- Maggie Cabbage family vegetables were left off the list of ingredients because= they give a strong (dominant) flavor; the flavor grows stronger (ages in= the freezer). If you like, use mild cabbages: napa, bok choy, a little= savoy, young brussels. Or use chard and endive. When using cabbage, try to= use the broth right away. Also, straining is important.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a version of the most common type of garam masala used throughout Uttar Pradesh and the Punjab, which goes well with onion-based sauces for meats and poultry. It is a spicy, pungent blend. Change the proportions to suit your taste and the dish. Break the cinnamon sticks into pieces. Crumble the bay leaves. Heat a heavy frying pan and after 2-3 minutes put in the whole spices. Dry roast over a medium heat until the color darkens, stirring or shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning. Leave to cool, then grind and blend with the mace. In an airtight container, the mixture will keep for 3-4 months. * To make a mild and subtle Moghul Masala, use only green cardamoms, cinnamon, black peppercorns, mace and a few cloves. * For a hot Gujerati Masala, add sesame seeds, fennel seeds, ajowan seeds and chilies. * For a mildish Kashmiri Masala, use black cumin seeds, green cardamoms, black peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, mace, and add a little grated nutmeg. * For a hot Parsi Dhansak Masala, add fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, chilies and ground turmeric, and double the amount of coriander seeds.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 large Onion; peeled and minced (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>2 Ribs celery; diced fine</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic; smashed and peeled, minced</li>
      <li>7 cups Matzo farfel; (OR about 10 boards finely broken matzos)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground white pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Hungarian paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Egg substitute or 3 extra large egg whites</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>2 cups Defatted sodium-reduced chicken broth; (Use 3 cups broth if you like it moist.)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Saute the onion and celery in the oil in a covered non-stick saute pan for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the cover, add the garlic, and continue to saute until wilted and tender. (Do not brown.) 2. Add the matzo farfel and stir until lightly toasted. 3. Combine the seasonings, egg substitute, parsley and chicken broth in a bowl. 4. Add to the matzo mixture, mix, and use to stuff the bird under the skin and/or in the seasoned body cavity. Secure with toothpicks or metal skewers. Linda's note: I made this recipe in a greased casserole dish and baked it (covered with foil) at 325 degrees F for approximately 45 minutes. Uncovered it and continued baking until top was lightly browned.... I have made the mushroom and nut variations- both were delicious. VARIATIONS: Mushroom Stuffing: Saute 2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms with the onion. You may add 1 tsp of crushed dried thyme or 1 tbsp of chopped fresh thyme to this mixture. Nut Stuffing: One cup coarsely chopped toasted walnuts and/or almonds may be added to the onion with the matzo farfel. Fruit Stuffing: Ten, drained pitted chopped prunes or apricots; 2 cups peeled, cored and diced apples; 1/2 cup dark raisins may be added with the seasonings and broth.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: WrdsmithME@aol.com Date: 29 Mar 1995 03:39:59 -0700 Here's a hard candy recipe that's published in a leaflet, "Guide to Hard Candy Making," by Apollo Mold Company. It's pretty good, though you have to be careful to use enough coloring and flavoring! In a saucepan, blend sugar, corn syrup, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat until mixture reaches 290 degrees Fahrenheit. Stir frequently with a metal (not wood) spoon. Remove pan from heat. Allow to stand until bubbles have simmered down. Add flavoring and color, as desired. Too much stirring will cause the syrup to solidify into a hard sugary lump. Mold into desired shapes in Apollo Hard Candy Molds sprayed lightly with a nonstick vegetable oil spray. Work fast. If mixture becomes too cold and thick, it may be warmed for a few seconds in a microwave. When hard candies are completely cooled, store them in airtight containers or place them, individually, in 3- by 5-inch plastic sucker bags.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Lean boneless meat</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Onion powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Liquid smoke</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil cooking spray</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Freeze meat until firm but not hard; then cut into 1/8 to 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a medium-size glass, stoneware, plastic or stainless steel bowl, combine soy sauce, Worcestershire, onion powder, pepper, garlic powder, and liquid smoke. Stir to dissolve seasonings. Add meat and mix until all surfaces are thoroughly coated. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or until next day, stirring occasionally; recover tightly after stirring. Drying the jerky: Depending upon the drying method you're using, evenly coat dehydrator racks or metal racks with cooking spray; if oven drying, place racks over rimmed baking pans. Lift meat form bowl, shaking off any excess liquid. Arrange meat strips close together, but not overlapping, on racks. Dehydrator drying: Arrange trays according to manufacturer's directions and dry at 140-degrees until a piece of jerky cracks, but does not break, when bent (8 to 10 hours; let jerky cool for 5 minutes before testing). Pat off any beads of oil from jerky. Let jerky cool completely on racks; remove from racks, place in a rigid freezer container, and freeze for 72 hour. Then store in airtight, insectproof containers in a cool, dry place; or freeze or refrigerate. Makes about 3/4 pound. Storage time: Up to 3 weeks at room temperature; up to 4 months in refrigerator, up to 8 months in freezer.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Machine Procedure (For a 2-cup capacity bread machine): All ingredients must be at room temperature, unless otherwise noted. Add ingredients, except toppings, in the order specified in your bread machine owner's manual. Set bread machine on dough/manual setting. At the end of the program, press clear/stop. To punch dough down, press start and let knead for 60 seconds. Press clear/stop again. Remove dough and let rest 5 minutes before hand-shaping. If your bread machine does not have a dough/manual setting, follow normal bread making procedure, but let dough knead only once. At the end of the kneading cycle, press clear/stop. Let dough rise for 60 minutes, checking after the first 30 minutes to make sure dough does not overrise and touch lid. Press start and let machine run for 60 seconds to punch dough down. Press clear/stop again. Remove dough and let rest 5 minutes before hand-shaping. Hand-Shaping Technique: Sprinkle hands with flour. With fingertips, spread dough evenly into a 13- X 9- X 1-inch lightly oiled baking pan. Cover with a clean kitchen cloth. Let rise until doubled in height, about 30 to 60 minutes. Preheat oven to 400F. Make light indentations with your fingertips in the surface of the risen dough. Brush with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt and black pepper. Bake on bottom rack of oven for approximately 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool in pan. Cut into twelve equal pieces and serve at room temperature.

In a mixing bowl, whip egg whites, water, salt, and black pepper together, using a fork. Pour egg mixture into skillet. Cook over moderately high heat until the bottom is set. Using a heatproof spatula, move the cooked mixture to the center and allow the uncooked mixture to flow into the bottom of the pan. When cooked, the omelet should be barely brown on the bottom, soft and moist in the center. Spoon the filling down the center of the omelet (*see note).

      <li>I usually add herbs to this (which I never measure, but about 2 tsp total is pretty flavorful), and top with seeds. I've also substituted or added whole wheat flour(up to 2 cups), wheat and/or oat bran, cheese, oil, dried garlic and onions, even spinach powder (which turned the bread green; I thought it looked gross, but everybody else liked it.) My favorite herb combo is dried, minced garlic (or garlic powder), dill weed, and dill seed. I use a mix of seeds for the top, usually sesame, poppy, flax, and caraway.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Hershey's Cocoa, heaping</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Pecans (opt)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Notes: Before you begin, be sure to fill sink half full of cold water. Also, butter a dinner plate (or similar dish) to the edge to pour the fudge on when it is done. In a deep, heavy bottomed pan (I use a pressure cooker pan), mix together sugar, cocoa and milk. Cook on high heat, stirring constantly to remove any lumps from cocoa and prevent burning, until mixture comes to a boil. Continue boiling, stirring occasionally, until mixture reaches soft ball stage (about 10-15 minutes) and turn off heat (if you have an electric stove, move pan off burner as it will overcook the fudge with the remaining heat on the burner). Add vanilla extract and butter. Place pan in sink of cold water to speed cooling; do not let the water come over the edge of the pan. Beat with spoon until fudge starts to thicken slightly, it will still have a glossy look to it. After it has cooled, remove pan from water (be sure and put a kitchen towel on your lap for protection as the pan will still be quite warm!) and continue to beat until the fudge loses its gloss and begins to get stiff. Add the pecans then. Beat a couple more minutes. Pour out onto buttered plate, scrape the sides and bottom to get as much on the plate as you can, let cool (if you can wait at least 10 minutes), and it is ready to serve. Notes: Test for soft ball stage by dropping a partial spoonful into a cup of cold water. When the mixture forms a `soft' ball, it is ready or you can use a candy thermometer (I never have mastered those things). If your fudge comes out runny or a bit soft, it was undercooked; if it is hard and grainy, it was overcooked. Mine turns out all ways and we eat it. This recipe is *not* fail proof and it takes a lot of practice and patience to get the hang of it, good luck and watch the waistline!

      <li>[The original author's general directions for pizza dough-making are quite lengthy and explicit; I include here only a portion of the general directions for bread machines and for making dough by hand. Her directions are more detailed, and include specific instructions for using dough makers, food processors, and heavy-duty mixers with dough hooks. I highly recommend the cookbook for any pizza-lover!] If using a bread machine, add the ingredients in the order specified for your particular machine. If your machine has a double kneading cycle, remove the dough after an hour of rising and turn off your machine; allowing the dough to knead a second time causes bubbles which are difficult to roll. If making by hand, proof the yeast in 1/4 to 1/3 of the water with a pinch of sugar. Then add the remaining liquid ingredients, mix well, then add the dry ingredients and stir until you can no longer work the dough with a spoon. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured counter, knead for 5 to 10 minutes, and allow to rise covered in a warm place for 50 to 60 minutes. =46or a thin-crust pizza, roll the dough out 1/8 inch thick; slightly thicke= r at the edges. Turn the edges up slightly to prevent run-off in the oven, and place toppings no closer than 1/4 inch to the edge of the dough, preferably no closer than 1/2 inch.

Add stock and heat quickly. Then cook,covered, 3 minutes over medium heat. Stir in snow peas. Combine mixture with tossed noodles (*See below) Variations: Substitute cooked beef,ham, chicken, duck, crabmeat, lobster or shrimp. You can also add shredded green onion to the garlic/ginger mixture. I use Shaoxing wine instead of sherry, which is more authentic. *To cook noodles, prepare boiling water with a little salt. Add noodles and cook until barely done. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Separate noodles with a fork, then toss them with a little sesame oil or peanut oil and set aside until they are ready to go into your stir-fry for the final heat. You will want about a pound of noodles for the above recipe. This recipe is simply a guideline for a dish that can be varied in a thousand ways!

Cut or mix fat into flour mixture utnil all particles are thouroughly coated and mixture esembels coarse cornmeal. Sotre mix in a jar or can with a tight lid. It can be measured into 2 cup amounts and put in plastic bags or jarsd where it will be ready for use. It may be stored at room temperature for 6 weeks. Vary the liquids: dry milk solids are already in the mix so more milk is not need. You can use fruit juice, water or meat broth for the liquid called for in a recipe. The recipes in this Pick-A-pocket book were written for commercial packaged baking mix which has no milk so it is the liquid called for in recipes. This mix is a perfect substitte.

    <title>Basic Fruit Jelly Recipe</title>

    <category>Christmas</category>
    <quantity>50</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Plus 2 oz fruit pulp</li>
      <li>(cup measurements are given</li>
      <li>With specific recipes)</li>
      <li>Syrup from canned fruits</li>
      <li>(used only with certain</li>
      <li>Fruits- see specific recipes</li>
      <li>3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Liquid, pectin-based,</li>
      <li>Jelling agent (Certo)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>PREPARING THE FRUIT:Wash, peel and seed the fruit if necessary. Most fruits are then pureed (see instructions given with specific recipes). Some fruits are used as they are and others are mixed with syrup from canned fruit. Because of their relatively neutral taste, peach and apricot syrups are best. They can even be mixed together. PREPARING THE MOLD AND JELLING AGENT: Line a small brownie pan(8x8x2-in.) with parchment paper. If using the jelling agent in a bottle, simply open the bottle; if using pouches, cut them open and stand them upright in a large jar or measuring cup so that they will be ready to use. COOKING THE FRUIT JELLY: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, place the fruit pulp or the fruit pulp-syrup mixture and the sugar. Bring to a rapid boil over high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula. Once a full rolling boil is reached start the cooking time; this will be from 4 to 9 minutes, always at a rapid boil and stirring constantly, depending on the fruit used (specific cooking times are given in specific recipes). Add the butter halfway through the cooking time. When it is time, remove the saucepan from the heat and immediatly add the liquid jelling agent; stir vegorously for a few seconds to be sure that it is completely mixed into the jelly mixture. TO MOLD, CUT AND SERVE THE FRUIT JELLIES: As soon as the jelling agent has been stirred in, pour the boiling hot fruit jelly into the brownie pan. Allow to set and cool completely, which will thke at least 2 to 3 hours. When the jelly is completely cold, run the blade of a knife all around the edge of the pan. Unmold and remove the paper; then cut it into squares about 3/4 inch on a side. Roll the squares one at a time in granulated sugar (preferably large grained). This step is not absolutely necessary; it does, however, keep the jellies from sticking to one another if piled on top of each other when served, and makes them more attractive. The fruit jellies can be placed in individual paper cases and served in a wooden box or a basket, or they can simply be piled on top of each other on a plate. TO STORE: The uncut jellies will keep for two months wrapped in the nonstick parchment paper it is molded on, placed in a box and kept in a cool cellar or refrigerator. If kept in a refrigerator the jelly picks up a little moisture but keeps its shine better. Once cut and rolled in sugar, the jellies will keep for a week in a closed container in the refrigerator. It is preferable to place them in individual paper cases if they are to be stored this way, to keep them from sticking together. These homemade fruit jellies are much softer than commercial ones.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Fish</li>
      <li>See instructions for additional ingredients; also see "Fishball Mixture" recipes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Fishballs can be used in a variety of ways: they can be deep-fried and served with a sweet-and-pungent sauce, combined with stir-fried vegetables, or added to soups and red-cooked dishes. Preparing the fish: Use either fish fillets or whole fish. With the latter, have the fish split in half and the head and big bones removed. Then, with a spoon or blunt knife, scrape the flesh from the skin. Always work from tail to head. (If you work the other way, the fine bones will come loose and be difficult to separate out.) Making the fish mixture: Follow any of the four recipes "Fishball Mixture A", B, C or D. Forming the fishballs: If the fish mixture is moist, take a fistful and squeeze it through a hole made by joining thumb and index finger, to form walnut-size balls. Or, if the mixture is of a drier consistency, shape the fishballs between the palms of the hands. (Moisten the hands first.) Cooking the fishballs: Bring 4 to 5 cups of water almost to a boil. Add fishballs and cook over medium heat until done (3 to 5 minutes). The fish liquid may be enriched with 4 beaten egg yolks and 1 teaspoon salt, stirred in at the end of cooking, and then served with the fish. Or a fish stock may be substituted and the fishballs cooked in it. To prepare stock, simmer the fish head and bones in 4 to 5 cups of water for an hour. Then stir in 1 tablespoon vinegar, a few drops of sherry, and either 1 tablespoon lard or a few drops of sesame oil. Storing fishballs: Fisbballs cannot be stored raw, but must be parboiled first. Plunge fishballs, a few at a time, into boiling water and cook until they float. Drain and let cool. Place in a large bowl of cold water, cover, and refrigerate. The fishballs will keep several days. NOTE: Two pounds of fish fillets make about 20 fishballs. From &lt;The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook&gt;, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.

(In some tribal traditions a hole is always made in the center which has spiritual significance) Fry in deep hot oil to a light golden brown, turn once to brown both sides. (Oil is hot enough if a small test piece of dough dropped in the oil begins cooking almost immediately and rises to the top.) Drain bread well and pat with paper towel to remove excess oil. Keep covered in a bowl while cooking to keep bread warm. Serving - Usually eaten like bread with soup, stew or posole Variations - Eat with honey, powedered sugar, cinnamon.

    <recipetext>
      <li>(Cooking Light) 1. Combine the first 3 ingredients in a bowl, and set aside. Beat margarine at medium speed of a mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually add sugar, beating at medium speed of a mixer until well-blended. Add vanilla and egg white, and beat well. Add flour mixture, and stir until well-blended. Turn dough out onto wax paper, and shape into a 6-inch log. Wrap log in wax paper, and freeze for 3 hours or until very firm. 2. Preheat oven to 350°. 3. Cut log into 24 (1/4-inch) slices, and place slices 1 inch apart on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. (For slicing, they recmmend either using dental floss, or a sharp knife). Bake at 350° for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from pan, and cool on wire racks. Yield: 2 dozen (serving size: 1 cookie). Variations: CHOCOLATE ICEBOX COOKIES: Reduce flour to 3/4 cup and add 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder with the dry ingredients. PEANUT BUTTER ICEBOX COOKIES: Reduce margarine to 3 Tablespoons, add 2TB peanut butter, and change the 2/3 cup sugar to 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup granulated sugar. BROWN SUGAR ICEBOX COOKIES: Instead of the granulated sugar, use 2/3 cup brown sugar. LEMON-CORNMEAL ICEBOX COOKIES: Reduce flour to 3/4 cup and add 1/4 cup yellow cornmeal with the dry ingredients. Also, increase the 2/3 cup granulated sugar to 3/4 cup, and add 2 tsp grated lemon rind with the wet ingredients. There are even additional variations listed in the magazine under each of the above categories which I won't include - but they all sound yummy! I highly recommend this double issue - thumb through it at the store. I am not affiliated with Cooking Light, I'm just a happy subscriber.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 small Cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 can Crushed tomatoes 28 oz.</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh oregano (Italian),</li>
      <li>Chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Parsley, chopped fine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the oil and garlic into a 2 quart saucepan and heat just until the aroma of the garlic releases - DON'T overcook the garlic (it shouldn't even turn brown)! Pour in the crushed tomatoes and set heat to simmer Stir in the sugar until disolved Stir in the oregano and parsley Simmer for fifteen minutes NOTES : Dried oregano can be used if you don't have fresh, but it definitely affects the flavor. This sauce can be used as a base for a variety of recipes - its great as a pizza sauce; loves to have things added to it like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms etc. and is even better after it has set for a day. Cooking Tip: When removing the cover from a simmering pot of tomato sauce, don't let the condensation from the lid drip back into the sauce. Its acidity will effect the flavor.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 large Artichokes</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fresh lemon juice OR juice of 2 lemons</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 medium Or large onions; sliced</li>
      <li>4 large Minced garlic cloves; or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 quart Water or stock; *see tip</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>2 pounds New potatoes; quartered OR cut into large dice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh chopped parsley</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>TIP: About 1 quart of water is needed, more or less. You can enhance flavors by using chicken or vegetable broth; or try a garlic stock (see separate recipe). Cut away the top leaves of the artichokes and break off the bottom leaves. Trim the bottoms and rub with the cut side of a lemon. Cut small artichokes in half, larger artichokes into quarters, and remove the spiny fibers with a sharp knife. Rub the cut edges with a cut lemon and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a lidded large heavy-bottomed saucepan or casserole over medium-low heat and add the onions. Saute, stirring, until tender, about 8 minutes. Add half the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic begins to color, about 1 minute. Add the artichokes, the juice of 1/2 lemon, water or stock to cover, the bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Add the potatoes, remaining garlic, remaining lemon juice, thyme, and parsley. Make sure the liquid covers everything (add as needed), cover, and simmer for another 30 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Adjust the seasonings and serve. ADVANCE PREP: This can be made several hours before serving and reheated.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 medium Sized artichokes or 4 small</li>
      <li>1/2 Lemon for preparing artichokes</li>
      <li>1 ounce Pancetta, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil preferably extra</li>
      <li>Virgin</li>
      <li>1 Onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>Salt &amp; freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 Large leek, thoroughly claned and sliced thinly</li>
      <li>3/4 pounds Pizza Dough</li>
      <li>Semolina or cornmeal for dusting</li>
      <li>2 ounces Mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated (2/3 cup)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place a pizza stone, baking tiles or an inverted baking sheet on the lowest rack of a cold oven; preheat for 30 minutes to 500 degrees F or the highest setting. For each of the artichokes, peel away and discard the tough outer leaves, snapping them off at the base, until you reach the pale yellow leaves with the darker green tops. Slice off the darkest green top and rub the artichoke with the cut side of the lemon half. With a paring knife, trim the artichoke where you snapped off the leaves, removing any green portions. Rub with lemon. Trim the bottom 1/4 inch off the stem and pare away the tough outer skin. With a melon baller or paring knife, remove the fuzzy choke from the center of the artichoke. Cut the heart into quarters, then cut each quarter into 4 pieces. Squeeze the lemon into a bowl of water and place the artichoke pieces into the acidulated water to keep them from turning brown. Heat a skillet over the medium heat, add pacetta and cook, stirring until golden about 4 minutes. Drain the pancetta on paper towels. Pour off fat from the skillet. Add 1 1/2 tsp. of the olive oil and onions to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft but not brown, about 3 minutes. Add the drained artichoke pieces and stir to mix well. Add pepper and 2/3 cup water. Cover and cook over low heat until the artichoke pieces are tender and most of the liquid has cooked away, about 15 minutes. Add leeks and stir to mix well. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding salt if desired. Let cool completely. Here we go with the dough again...Place dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a disk. Use a rolling pin or your hands to roll or stretch the dough into a circle that is 1/4 inch thick and 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a semolina or cornmeal dusted pizza peel or inverted baking sheet. Brush the dough with a little of the remaining olive oil. Distribute the artichoke mixture over the dough. Sprinkle the cheeses over the artichoke mixture. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Carefully slide the pizza onto the heated pizza stone and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the bottom is crisp and browned and the top is bubbling.

    <ingredient>
      <li>24 Baby artichokes or canned artichoke hearts--not marinated</li>
      <li>2 Lemons</li>
      <li>8 ounces Uncooked cannelloni</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Low-fat mozzarella cheese; diced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Skim milk or soymilk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>If you're using fresh artichokes, fill a large bowl with cold water and squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon into it. Reserve both lemon halves. Peel away any hard green leaves from each artichoke and slice off the top of each stem. Cut away the yellow leaves as close to the base as possible, then skin the base and the stem, removing the tough, green outside layer. Remove the fuzzy "choke" (center part) with the tip of a knife and discard it. Cut each artichoke in half and rub the squeezed lemon half over all surfaces, then drop the artichokes into the bowl of water. When all the artichokes are trimmed, drain and rinse them; then place them in a pan with enough water to cover. Simmer, covered, over medium heat until tender, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside. If you're using canned artichoke hearts, drain and set aside. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, dice the artichokes and combine with the diced mozzarella. Add salt. Peel the rind from the uncut lemon, being careful to keep it in one or two large pieces; set aside. Juice this lemon and the remaining 1/2 lemon; set aside the juice. When the artichoke mixture and pasta are ready, pour the milk into a small pot and add the lemon rind. Heat until the milk begins to bubble; then remove the lemon rind and remove the pot from the heat. In a separate pan, melt the butter or margarine over low heat and whisk in the flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, stirring constantly. When all the flour has been added, continue to cook and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and slowly add hot milk, stirring constantly. Add the reserved lemon juice. Over low heat, cook and stir until the sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400F. Spread a little sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13" baking pan. If you're using fresh pasta, roll each rectangle around a portion of the artichoke mixture and place the cannelloni in the baking pan; if you'r using uncooked cannelloni, prepare the pasta according to the package directions; drain and let cool. Stuff each piece with the artichoke mixture and place in the pan. Spread the remaining sauce over the top. Cover the pan with foil and bake 15 minutes.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 large Artichokes</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 Lemons cut in wedges</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pull off outer layers of deep green leaves from each artichoke and discard. Cut off stem and set aside. Rub each cut with a lemon wedge. Place artichoke on its side and cut off top third. Discard these points. Using a pair of scissors, cut offthe sharp points. Soak 10 minutes in cold water with 1 ounce. lemon juice. Carefully open the leaves by prying with your fingers as if opening a flower and the pressing down on the counter the opening face. Drain each artichoke on paper towels, shaking to remove all liquid. Season aggressively with salt and pepper between each leaf and all over. Heat the virgin olive oil in a tall side sauce pan, 8-inch to 10-inch wide at base until just smoking. Cook artichokes in this hot oil 12 to 15 minutes, until golden all over. After 10 minutes of cooking, spritz the pan by shaking your wet hand over the artichokes to mist them. Be careful: this will cause the oil to sizzle and spatter.. When the artichokes are cooked, remove each one, and holding the artichoke by skewering its base with a fork, press the flower side down to force it further open. Drain on paper towels, season with salt and pepper again and serve with lemon wedges.

      <li>1 1/2 pounds Chicken legs, skinless; cut up and defatted</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions; peel thinly slice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground saffron; dissolved in</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Hot water</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Chopped fresh mint</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>1 pound Fresh artichoke hearts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>STEP #1 - Heat a non-stick saute pan and lightly brown chicken. Add 1 tablespoon oil and the onion. Fry over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes or until onion becomes translucent. Add salt, pepper, saffron water, and turmeric. Pour in 1 1/2 cups water. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. STEP #2 - In a non-stick skillet, fry the parsley and mint in 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat for 10 minutes and add to the chicken. STEP #3 - Add lime juice and the artichoke hearts to the chicken. Cover and simmer for 40 to 55 minutes over low heat. STEP #4 - Check to see if the artichoke hearts are tender. Taste the khoresh and adjust seasoning. Transfer it to a deep casserole. Cover and place in a warm oven until ready to serve. STEP #5 - Serve hot from the same dish with steamed basmati; cook it very slowly with a very tight fitting lid. Add salt to water to help rice withstand a longer cooking time. Nush-e jan! (Enjoy this food of life.) VARIATIONS: For *ab ghureh* substitute 3/4 cup unripe grape juice for the lime juice. Frozen (2 9-oz pkgs) or bottled artichokes may be substituted. Drain well. If pre-cooked, adjust cooking time, adding artichoke hearts when appropriate to step 3. Chicken can be replaced with 1 pound lean stew meat such as lamb, veal or beef, cut into 1 inch cubes. In step 1, increase water to 2-1/2 cups; and simmer for 55 minutes instead of 30 minutes. Copyright (c) 1994 by Najmieh Khalili Batmanglij. Persian Cooking for a Healthy Kitchen.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 medium Onions</li>
      <li>1 pound Red potatoes, small</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large Clove garlic; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt; or to taste</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Artichoke hearts, marinated; well drained</li>
      <li>10 Eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Flat-leaf parsley; chopped</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Parmesan cheese; grated</li>
      <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel, quarter, and slice the onions. Scrub the potatoes, and if they are very samll, cut in 1/4-inch slices; if they're larger, quarter them lengthwise, then slice them. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large non-stick saute pan. Cook the onions, potatoes, and garlic in the oil, with a little salt, stirring them often until they are tender. Drain the marinated artichoke hearts well and trim off any tough, fibrous leaves. Quarter the artichoke hearts and add them to the potatoes and onions in the pan; stir everything together, then remove the pan from the heat. Beat the eggs in a large bowl with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the chopped parsley, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper to taste. Add all the vegetables in the pan to the eggs, and stir it all together. Clean the saute pan to remove the starchy residue from the potatoes, wipe it dry, and then heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil in it. Pour in the egg and vegetable mixture, spreading it evenly, lower the heat to a very small flame, and cover the pan. Cook the frittata for 8-10 minutes, or until the eggs at the top are almost set. Put the pan under a hot broiler for a few minutes to finish the frittata. It should be just slightly golden brown on top. Loosen the frittata gently with a knife or spatula until it moves freely in the pan, then slide it out onto a platter or place a platter over the pan and invert. Cut the frittata in wedges to serve. This is best eaten warm or at room temperature, so if you are taking it to a picnic, pack it into the hamper rather than the cooler. If you must keep it longer than a few hours, refrigerate it but allow it to come to room temperature before serving for best flavor.

    <category>Import</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 tablespoon Freshly squeezed lemon juice or vinegar</li>
      <li>3 Artichokes; (about 1/2 pound each)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large Onion,; finely chopped</li>
      <li>6 Extra-large eggs</li>
      <li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Freshly grated Parmigiano</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped fresh marjoram, or; 1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Coarsely chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat a broiler. Have ready a large ceramic bowl (do not use metal) filled with cold water to which you have added the lemon juice or vinegar. Trim only a thin slice from the bottom of the stem of each artichoke to remove the dark skin. Pare off all the green skin. The flesh of the stem is good. With your hand, pull off the tough outer leaves until you reach leaves that have tender, white areas at their base. (cut off only the upper part of the inner leaves that are dark green at the top and light greenish yellow at the base.) The inner rows of leaves are the tender part you want, so be careful not to cut away too much. Cut the artichoke in half lengthwise and, with a small knife, cut out the hairy choke and any other tough inner purple leaves. Immediately put the cleaned artichokes into the acidulated water to prevent them from turning brown. When all of the artichokes have been turned, drain them. Place each artichoke half cut side down on a surface and cut lengthwise into 1 /4-inch-thick slices. Bring a large saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the artichokes and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and boil until tender but not mushy. Fresh, young artichokes will be ready in approximately 5 minutes; old, tough artichokes may take up to 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and allow to cool. In a small skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the onion and saute until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs lightly with a fork. Beat in the remaining Parmigiano with the oil, lemon juice, garlic, and pepper to taste. Drizzle over the fish. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve at room temperature. Recipe By :CHEF DU JOUR SHOW #DJ9210 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #265 Date: Mon, 28 Oct 1996 08:56:25 -0500 From: Meg Antczak &lt;meginny@node1.frontiernet.net&gt;</li>

      <li>1 pound Bacon; raw med slice</li>
      <li>2 cups Artichoke hearts; marinated, drained</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut package of bacon slices in halves or thirds crosswise to make shorter strips. Cut artichoke hearts in half. Wrap each piece of artichoke heart with a bacon strip and fasten with a toothpick. Spray a broiler pan (like the two-piece one that came with your stove) with Pam and arrage appetizers on it, not touching if possible. Up to this point recipe can be done ahead, wrapped in foil, and refrigerated if it has to wait more than 2 hours. 15 minutes before serving time, sprinkle brown sugar over the top and bake in a 350 F. oven until bacon is crisped to your taste. Serve on a plate lined with paper napkins, or if on a buffet put in warmer lined with paper towels or a rack.

      <li>Garry Howard, Cambridge, MA. &lt;garhow@hpubmaa.esr.hp.com&gt; Recipe By: John Bilos - jbilos@labs-n.bbn.com The following appetizer is sure to be a crowd pleaser. I have never taken it anywhere without being asked for the recipe. Cup up pita bread into chip size triangles, separate and bake on a cookie sheet until crispy (approx 5 minutes). Combine all other ingredients and mash (a KitchenAid mixer works great). Bake in an uncovered casserole dish for approx 30 minutes @ 350 or until bubbly. Serve hot out of the oven and scoop up dip with pita bread. If you intend to take this to a party or are having friends over be prepared to recite this recipe a number of times. My wife and I bring xerox copies with us! John Bilos NOTES: I got this recipe off the internet five years ago and have made it many times. I made it to take to a party this past New Year's Eve (95). It was originally posted by John Bilos at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. in Cambridge, MA. What he says is true. Someone asked for the recipe again on New Year's Eve. I create my own adaption of the recipe by adding some green chiles. The last time I made it, I used about 4 poblano chiles and 3 hot New Mexican chiles roasted and chopped. I personally think this is a delicious addition! CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>large Basil leaves; sliced in strips</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>SLICE THE UPPER 2/3 of the leaves off the artichokes, then break off the remaining leaves, snapping them off at the base. Trim off the dark green stubs, going around the artichoke with a paring knife. Cut them in quarters, remove the fuzzy choke and slice each quarter into pieces 1/4-to-1/2-inch thick. As you work, rub the cut surfaces with lemon and put them in a bowl with the lemon juice and water to cover. Gently warm the olive oil with half the basil. When it is fairly hot, but not sizzling, add the onions and the sliced artichokes. Salt lightly and give them a stir to coat them with the oil, then add 3/4 cup water and cook over a medium-low flame. As the water cooks off, add more, in 1/2-cup increments until the artichokes are cooked, about 25 minutes. Add the peas and continue cooking until they are done. Let any liquids reduce until they are syrupy. Taste and season with salt. Add the rest of the basil, the parsley and the butter or olive oil. To brighten the flavors, stir in a little lemon juice or champagne vinegar to taste.

      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh oregano; chopped</li>

      <li>*To prepare the artichokes: Squeeze juice from 2 lemon halves into large bowl of cold water; add squeezed lemon halves. Cut off top half of each artichoke and discard. Cut off stem of artichoke. Starting at base, bend tough outer leaves back and snap off where they break naturally, leaving tender inner leaves. Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until no dark green areas remain. Scoop out fibrous choke and small purple-tipped leaves, using spoon. Rub exposed areas with lemon half. Place in lemon water until ready to use or up to 2 hours. Heat oven to 400øF. Mix breadcrumbs and oil in medium bowl. Spread mixture on large rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden on edges, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in lemon juice, oregano, garlic and lemon peel. Season with salt and pepper. Drain artichokes. Gently pull leaves outward from center until leaves open slightly. Fill artichoke cavities with bread stuffing. Pack stuffing between leaves. Place artichokes in 13x9x2 glass baking dish. Dot tops with butter. Pour 1/2 cup water into dish. Cover dish with foil; bake until wooden skewer pierces artichokes easily; adding more water as necessary, about 40 minutes. Remove foil. Continue baking until tops are golden, about 20 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.

    <title>Artichokes Stuffed with Herbed Goat Cheese</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 medium Artichokes; (About 1/2 Lb. Each)</li>
      <li>4 ounces Chevre Cheese; Softened</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Fresh Herbs; Chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh Chives; Chopped</li>
      <li>2 small Cloves Garlic; Finely Minced</li>
      <li>1 pinch Black Pepper; Freshly Ground</li>
      <li>1 small Baguette</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Prepare and cook medium artichokes as directed - remove any stem to form a flat base. (Scrape off stem's fibrous skin with a vegetable peeler and cook along with the globe, or use it as an ingredient in a stuffing or saute.) Cut straight across the artichoke, removing about the top third of the leaves. Using kitchen shears, trim off the torny tips of the other leaves. Turn the artichokes upside down in water, and shake well to wash off any pesticides, dirt, and insects. Cut artichokes tend to darken quickly, so as soon as they are trimmed and washed, place them in a mixture of 2 T of lemon juice or vinegar per quart of water while you finish your recipe preparation. Usually place trimmed artichokes leaf side down in poaching liquid. Cover and simmer over medium to low heat from about 30-40 minutes. Cool, then remove choke and scrape out thistle. Set aside. Preheat oven to 375. In a small bowl, combine chevre with herbs, chives, garlic and black pepper. Fill cavity of artichoke with cheese mixture, and spoon some in between leaves. Place artichokes in a shallow pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes, or until goat cheese is thoroughly warm. Serve with hand-torn pieces of bread. Shared by Jill Proehl, REG 2 - St. Louis, MO NOTES : For Herb Mix, it is recommended you use a combination of oregano, basil, marjoram, and parsley. To stuff - grab hold of the choke, willfully pulling it out. Dig down with a small knife or serrated grapefruit spoon and remove the thistle. To make it easier, parboil the artichoke for about 10 minutes, turn leaf side down and press firmly on the base of the heart, spreading leaves and opening choke area for removal and stuffing.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 large Artichokes</li>
      <li>Juice of 1 large lemon</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Virgin olive oil; (up to 5 Tab.)</li>
      <li>1 large Garlic clove; sliced</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>15 Peppercorns; coarsely ground in a mortar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Parsley; finely chopped</li>
      <li>6 Eggs; lightly beaten, can use up to 8 eggs in this recipe</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Coarsely grated Romano cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Break off the hard outer leaves of the artichokes; then cut off the top two thirds of the greens. Trim the outsides, cut the artichokes into quarters, and immediately put them in a bowl with cold water to cover and the lemon juice. Remove the choke from each piece with a knife; then thinly slice each quarter into 3 or 4 pieces and return them to the water. Just before cooking, remove the pieces from the water and blot them dry with a towel. Heat 2 or 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in an 8-inch frying pan with the garlic. When the garlic colors, remove it and then add the drained artichokes. Give pan a shake right away to coat the pieces with oil, then season with salt and pepper and add about 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Saute' until the artichokes browned and thoroughly cooked. Beat the eggs, season them lightly with salt, and add the rest of the parsley, cheese, and the cooked artichokes. Wipe out the pan, add enough of the remaining oil just to coat the bottom, and pour in the eggs. Give the pan a shake to loosen the eggs, then lower the heat. Cook, covered, until the bottom is golden. Slide the frittata onto a plate, then turn it back into the pan, with the opposite side down, and continue to cook until it is also nicely colored. Serve warm or at room temperature, sliced into wedges. This Italian-style omelet can be cooked either at the last minute and served warm. or, to make it easier on the cook, ahead of time and served at room temperature The artichokes are first fried in olive oil with pepper and parsley and then cooked with the eggs. Use a nonstick or seasoned frying pan to keep eggs from sticking.

I prefer the "unglazed" versions, because I think the hold more moisture, but try these two recipes for starters... Place mushrooms, onion, and garlic in cooker. Coat chicken pieces with mixture of flour, salt, paprika, and rosemary. Arrange chicken over vegetables, and pour in the broth and sherry. Bake at 450 degrees for one hour.

      <li>1 teaspoon Whole black peppercorns</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Whole coriander seeds</li>
      <li>2 Whole bay leaves</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves; peeled, and lightly mashed</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Lemon juice; plus...</li>
      <li>1 Whole lemon</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt; or to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 Boiling potato (about 8 oz.)</li>
      <li>1 small Onion</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Tie up the fennel, peppercorns, coriander seeds, bay leaves, and garlic in a cheesecloth bundle and drop into a 2-1/2 quart pot. Add 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and remove the cheesecloth bundle, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Add the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and sugar. Mix and set aside. Halve the lemon. Cut off the long artichoke stems, if there are any. 1. Starting near the stem end, press back the artichoke leaves, one by one, and then snap them off. Keep doing this until you have gone past the bowl part of the artichoke that harbors the heat and have reached the paler inner leaves. Using a sharp knife (a serrated one is particularly good), cut off the remaining leafy area and discard it. Immediately rub all cut sections with a lemon half. 2. Scoop away the "choke" in the center of the artichoke with a grapefruit spoon. Squeeze a little lemon juice into this area and rub it in. 3. Using a sharp paring knife, trim the outside of the artichoke bowl so there are no more dark green sections left and the bowl gets a smooth appearance. Rub these newly cut sections with lemon. Cut each artichoke heart into four, again rubbing cut sections with lemon. Cut and prepare the remaining artichokes the same way. Peel the potato and cut into sections that seem roughly the same size as the pieces of artichoke heart. Peel the onion and cut it into eight sections. Put the artichoke hearts, potatoes, and onion into prepared liquid and bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat and simmer for about 12 minutes. Remove a piece of potato and a piece of artichoke. Cut off sections of each and taste for doneness and balance of salt and lemon. You may add more of either seasoning at this time if you wish. Cover and simmer another 3 to 7 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Uncover and cool the vegetables in the liquid. You may refrigerate the contents of the pot if you wish. When serving, remove the cool (or cold) vegetables with a slotted spoon. Do not serve the liquid.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Artichoke hearts (you must thaw them if they are frozen) 6 to 8 of them</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small Potato, cooked and cubed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Rosemary leaves, fresh and minced</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Freshly grated Parmesan</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GARNISH</li>
      <li>Italian parsley, chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Bring a small saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, and add the artichoke hearts. Lower the heat and simmer for 3 minutes; then rinse, drain and pat dry. Set them aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch skillet (preferable nonstick.) Add the potato and rosemary, and saute until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Add the artichoke hearts and saute until golden, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside. 3. Preheat the broiler. 4. Lightly beat the eggs with the 1/4 ts. and black pepper to taste. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet. Pour in the eggs and cook, over medium-low heat, stirring lightly, just until the bottom is set, 3 to 4 minutes. The top should still be wet. Add the artichokes and potatoes; sprinkle with the cheeses. Place the skillet under the broiler and cook until the frittata is golden and sizzling, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately. From the book "The New Basics cookbook" by Julee Rosso amd Sheila Lukens Wonderful book, I highly reccomend it.

      <li>1. This is very simple -- I invented it years ago and have served it to others who like it. Just quarter and dry the hearts, saute in a pan with quartered mushrooms, butter/margarine and some garlic. Makes a nice side dish with chicken and rice/potatoes. BTW -- when using artichoke hearts I always drain them AND dry them (squeeze dry in a clean dish towel) thoroughly, otherwise they taste watery. 2. Buy some good fresh pasta and alfredo sauce at the grocery. Cook as directed and combine sauce with artichoke hearts, cooked shrimp, and mushrooms (I usually saute the mushrooms first). You could use cooked ham or chicken in place of the shrimp. 3. Saute artichoke hearts with some other stuff and mix with cooked rice. The other stuff can include green onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, garlic, tomatoes. This would be the stuff I would use -- you can make up your own list. I usually just look at what's in the fridge... Sauteing can be done in butter/margarine or oil or both combined. 4. Eat cold, dipped in a little mayonnaise. 5. Put in pasta salad.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>** See recipes for Oyster Souffle Base, and Oyster Sauce. Trim the artichokes and rub the cut ends with lemon. (This prevents oxidation which can turn the ends of the artichokes brown.) Drop the artichokes into boiling salted water and cook for 30 minutes or until the bottoms are just tender and a leaf pulls out with only slight resistance. Remove the choke from the water, re-form the cooked artichoke and stuff with the souffle base. Preheat your oven to 375 F. Bake for 20 minutes or until the souffle is puffed and brown. Serve topped with Oyster Sauce.

      <li>Text Only</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The Aussie recipes I've been posting are from "Raw Materials", a column written by Meryl Constance for the Sydney Morning Herald. In each column she zeros in on a particular foodstuff, tells a bit about its uses and history and then presents recipes utilizing it. Nice format. Since I really like the style and content of the food sections that Mark sent over I'm posting her whole column on artichokes rather than just the recipes so folks here can get a feel for it. Here's the introductory material. The recipes follow in the next three posts. Globe artichokes are among the most beautiful of vegetables - witness their frequent appearance in still-life paintings. And for fineness of flavour and texture, they rank alongside that other luxury vegetable, asparagus. Yet fresh artichokes are greatly underused in this country and many people are only acquainted with the inferior tinned version, which is about as much like the real thing as tinned asparagus is like fresh. Globe artichokes are in season now and well worth seeking out. Besides their culinary virtues, they have health-food status, being low in kilojoules (about 90 kJ per I 00 g) and a source of various vitamins and minerals. At present, they cost about 60c to 80c each, though Raw Materials recently saw some magnificently fat specimens for $2 each in Leichhardt, where the Italian community knows how to appreciate them. They are said to have originated in Sicily and certainly they were developed into their modern form by Italian growers. Botanically, globe artichokes are thistle buds. Choose tightly furled artichokes which are as fat as possible. They will keep for a few days in the fridge, lightly wrapped in plastic, and even better if their stems are in water. Before use, they should be soaked upside down in a sinkful of water to remove any dirt or insect residents. Australians' underuse of artichokes probably has a lot to do with lack of knowledge about how to deal with them and a vague idea that it is a complex matter with traps for the unwary. The trap, of course, is the aptly-named choke, a hairy inedible portion lurking at the heart of the vegetable, at the centre of the leaves and on top of the succulent base. Provided you know not to try eating it, it's no problem. Another daunting factor is the instruction, given in so many recipe books, to snip off the top third of each leaf - fiddly and unnecessary (unless you chance across the rare spinella variety, which is cone-shaped and has a little thorn at the tip of each leaf). When artichokes are served whole, plainly boiled and with a dipping sauce, as an entree, there is no need to trim the leaves at all. In fact, to do so dims their beauty as an object on the plate. The diner pulls away each leaf by the tip, dips the base in the sauce and draws the base of the leaf through the teeth to scrape off the meaty flesh there. Used leaves are piled to one side until all have been detached. Then it is just a matter of removing the choke with a spoon or knife, before enjoying the best part of all, the base. The whole process is a little ritual. But many artichoke recipes are less reverent and are designed to let the diner eat the whole vegetable with no mucking about. For these, it's just a matter of slicing off the whole top of the vegetable, leaving between a half and two thirds. Discard a couple of layers of the tough outside leaves and tidy up the base (leave as much as you can). If the artichokes are to be halved or quartered, it is easy to see and remove the choke. If they are to be served whole, pull and cut out the innermost leaves and open out the centre so that you can scrape out the fibrous white choke with a teaspoon. Cut surfaces of an artichoke blacken very quickly, so immediately rub them with a lemon and drop the artichoke pieces into water acidulated with lemon juice (or vinegar at a pinch) until you are ready to deal with them. Don't cook them in aluminium or they will go black immediately. From "Raw Materials" by Meryl Constance, The Syndey Morning Herald, 10/13/92. Courtesy Mark Herron.

    <ingredient>
      <li>8 medium Artichokes</li>
      <li>1 Lemon; halved</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion; minced</li>
      <li>1 pound Spniach; washed and drained</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Shelled walnuts; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Heavy cream; *see note</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Vegetable broth</li>
      <li>OR dark beer</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Peel artichokes*: break off each leaf at the base (bend the leaf back on itself until it snaps, then pull it off towards the base). When most of the outer leaves have been peeled off and the remaining leaves no longer snap, cut off the rest of the cone and rub the cut portions with the lemon to prevent discoloration. 2. Using a sharp paring knife, trim off all bits of green to expose the more tender white part of the artichoke bottom. Rub with the lemon. 3. Place the artichoke bottoms in a saucepan with the lemon juice and enough water to cover. Simmer, covered, for 30-45 minutes or until the artichoke bottoms are tender when pierced wlth a knife. Cool in liquid and reserve. 4. Heat the oil in a skillet over low heat. Saute tht onion until lightly browned. Add the spinach and cook, stirring constantly, until wilted. 5. Place the spinach, walnuts, and cream in a food processor and puree. Season with salt and pepper. 6. Remove the artichoke bottoms from their liquid. Rinse under cold water and remove the choke with a spoon. When finished, you should have 2 perfectly rounded, hollowed-out cups per serving. 7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Fill the artichoke bottoms with spinach cream. Place in a glass baking dish large enough to hold all the bottoms in one layer. Drizzle with the broth or beer, cover with aluminum foil, and bake for 25 minutes, basting occasionally. Just before serving, douse with the remaining liquid from the bottom of the pan. SERVES 4 in 2 hrs of moderately difficult preparation. Serve as an appetizer; or serve with a pasta entree: spaghetti with oil and garlic sauce and lemon; as part of a buffet. MAKE AHEAD: The artichoke bottoms will keeps refrigerated in their cooking liquid for 1 to 2 days. *TIP: Using this method instead of cutting off the leaves with a knife will result in a meatier artichoke bottom. *LOWFAT CREAMS (thin as needed): lowfat or nonfat sour cream; sour cream substitutes; soy cream; lowfat or nonfat yogurt; ricotta; pureed lowfat or nonfat cottage cheese with skim milk; "creamed" tofu; nonfat cream (new product 1997). &gt;"Il Fondo dei di Carciofi Ripiene di Spinaci," from SOLO VERDURA, by Anne Bianchi (Ecco, 1997). &gt;Edited by Pat Hanneman 3/98 Puree of spinach, walnuts, and cream as a filling for prepared bottoms and cooked until the flavors blend. The leaves may be used to flavor a soup or a marinara sauce. Or puree the tender parts of the leaves and use them instead of the spinach in this recipe.

    <title>Artichokes Jewish Style</title>
    <category>Italian</category>
    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>12 Artichokes; medium, fresh</li>
      <li>2 Lemons; juice and rinds salt pepper; freshly ground</li>
      <li>3 cups Olive oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Carciofo All Guidia To quote the author, "This is the most famous of all Italian Jewish foods. It originated with the Roman Jews, and owes its fame to having been served at a restaurant in the Roman ghetto where it was discovered and quickly adopted by connoisseurs of excellent food all over Europe. Utimately it found its way into many Italian cookbooks, My mother, a Jewish woman who was born and raised in Rome, prepared especially delicious Carciofi all Guidia (better than you could find in any restaurant!). I watched her prepare them, and have prepared them myself, practically all my life. Here in my mother's technique in detail" Trim the artichokes as detailed in "How to clean artichokes- Jewish style" and keep them in lemon water till you are ready to use them. "Drain the two artichokes and, holding one in each hand by the stem and bottom, gently hit the leafy parts against each other until the leaves of one open up a little. Place the opened artichoke, bottom up, on a board or a working surface. Drain another artichoke from its bath and repeat what you did with the first two, and line up the one that opens next to the last one. Continue until all the artichokes are opened up. The last one will have to be tapped against the board. In a small bowl, combine salt and pepper. Take one artichoke at a time and sprinkle all over, including between the leaves, with salt and pepper mixture. Heat the oil in a deep earthenware or similar saucepan. Cook as many artichokes at a time as fit in one layer over moderate heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the bottoms and the sides are well browned. During the cooking period, sprinkle some cold water over the artichokes to produce steam, so that the inside will be cooked, too. To do this the authentic way, have a bowl containing cold water near the range. Dip your closed fist in the water and then open it forcefully over the roasting artichokes. Repeat sprinkling several times. When all the artichokes are done, transfer them to a plate, bottom side down to keep the moisture in.* Pick them up at the bottom with a fork and dip them, one by one in the hot oil again, pressing the leaves to the bottom of the pan. The artichokes will open up like roses and the leaves will become golden and crisp. Serve immediately. NOTE: Although traditionally Carciofi alla Giudia are served piping hot, they are delicious at room temperature. *Up to this point you may prepare the artichokes several hours ahead of time and keep them, bottom side down, so that they do not lost their moisture. Should they become too dry, sprinkle some cold water on them when reheating and press the leaves down against the bottom of the pan.

      <li>3 medium Tomatoes; peeled</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Rigani or oregano</li>
      <li>125 grams Feta cheese; cut in 6 slices</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note: Lamb steaks should be about 2 cm (3/4 inch) thick. Serves: 6 Oven temperature: 200 C (400 F) Cooking time: 25-30 minutes Trim steaks of most of the fat and shape neatly - trimmings can be used in a ground lamb dish. Season with pepper. Heat butter or oil in a frying pan and brown steaks quickly on each side - do not cook through. Lift out onto a dish and leave until cool. Add onions to pan and fry gently until transparent, add garlic and remove from heat. Brush a sheet of fillo pastry with melted butter and place another sheet on top, brushing again with butter. Fold in half to make almost a square of fillo. Put aside and cover wtih a dry tea towel, then one dampened with warm water. Repeat with remaining fillo to give 6 prepared squares. Take one square and brush top with butter - leave remaining pastry covered. Place a lamb steak in the centre and season lightly with salt. Top with onion-garlic mixture and cover with 2 slices of tomato. Sprinkle with a little rigani, salt and pepper and place a slice of feta cheese on top. Bring up ends of fillo pastry and double-fold over top. Fold in ends as you would a package then tuck ends underneath. This is known as a the chemist's (druggist's) fold. Place on a buttered baking tray. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Brush tops and sides of packages lightly with melted butter and bake in a preheated hot oven for 15 minutes. Serve immediately if possible, though they will survive in the oven with heat turned off for about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve with boiled green beans or zucchini dressed with olive and lemon juice. Note: Medallions of lamb cut from a trimmed loin can be used instead of the steaks. You will require 12, and place 2 in each package. From: "The Complete Middle East Cookbook" by Tess Mallos.

      <li>Simple ethnic recipes, unchanged for generations, often have an authority that the latest food fashions cannot begin to match. The following Greek lemon lamb dish is a case in point. Faithful to its frugal origins. this recipe works equally well with cheap cuts like lamb shanks. breast of lamb or best end of neck. If you do use these fattier meals, make the dish a day ahead, refrigerate it and remove the fat that coagulates on top. if anything, the dish gains added depth of flavour when made ahead and reheated. Trim skin and ail excess fat from a boned shoulder or leg of lamb. Squeeze enough lemons to provide 1/3 cup of juice. Open out the meat and rub both inside and outside surfaces with some of the lemon juice and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. On the inside surface of the meat, sprinkle a teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2 a tablespoon of chopped fresh oregano. Roll the meat up and tie securely. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pot large enough to take the roll comfortably and brown the meat on all sides. Turn the heat down to low and add to the pot the rest of the lemon juice, 2 cloves of garlic, crushed, and another teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2 tablespoon of fresh. Cover the pot and simmer very gently, turning occasionally, for about 2 1/2 hours, till very tender. If you like, add small new potatoes to the pot about an hour before serving. To serve, remove the string and slice the meat into the centre of a heated serving platter. Surround with potatoes and pour lemony juices over the meat. Makes 6 servings.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Karen Mintzias</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>8 Loin lamb chops</li>
      <li>18 Sheets commercial phyllo</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Butter; hot and melted</li>
      <li>2 cups Peas; cooked and drained</li>
      <li>16 Potato balls; parboiled</li>
      <li>16 Cherry tomatoes; peeled</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Kasseri cheese; in 8 pieces</li>
      <li>Salt &amp; freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 pinch Dried oregano</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note: 3/4-inch slices leg of lamb may be used instead of lamb chops. In a heavy skillet, heat the oil or butter and fry the lamb over high heat, turning frequently. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, unroll the filo sheets and cover with a damp towel. In a small pan over low heat, have the butter hot without letting it brown. Remove two sheets of filo, brush with hot butter over the first, then cover with the second sheet and brush it with butter. In the center of the buttered filo place 1 lamb chop, 2 tablspoons peas, 2 potato balls, 2 cherry tomatoes, and a slice of kasseri. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, a heaping tablespoon of parsley, and a pinch of oregano. Fold the filo around the lamb and vegetables like a sealed parcel. Place, seam side down, on a buttered baking pan (approximately 11 x 15 x 3 inches) and set aside while you repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients to make 8 "parcels". Brush hot butter on the tops, then bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden in color. Remove from the oven and arrange on a warm platter or on individual dishes. Serve warm, with a fresh-cooked or raw vegetable salad. Note: The vegetables and herbs may be varied. Substitute green beans or lima beans for peas, use thyme or basil instead of oregano. Arni Exohiko is frequently prepared using buttered waxed paper, parchment paper or aluminum foil rather than with filo. From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.

      <li>1 Text Reference</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here are my favorite tips and basic bread recipe: 1. Don't by those tiny packets of active-dry yeast. Get it in bulk in a health-food store. They charge at least 10x more for those tiny packets -- you're paying almost entirely for the packaging. (Store yeast in the fridge.) 1 packet = 1 TB. 2. Wheat gluten is very useful in helping the dough rise. I add around 1 TB per cup of non-bread flour ingredients. 3. Oil is NOT necessary and actually detracts from the taste. All you really need for good bread is flour, salt, yeast, and water. Everything else is optional. 4. The best breads are simply a mix of flours (whole wheat, rye, oats, corn, buckwheat, rice, or whatever you like). Remember thought that wheat flours are necessary for the gluten content, unless you add gluten separately. Adding fruits and herbs and flavored liquids are interesting but I prefer "pure" breads. I prefer graham flour over regular whole wheat. 5. Each machine is different and my recipes are usually not exact -- if the dough looks sticky and isn't forming a ball then it's too wet: add more flour; if it looks dry (ball doesn't have a relatively smooth surface, for example) add more liquid a tablespoon or two at a time. OK, so with all that idealism taken care of here's my basic bread recipe: 1 TB active dry yeast 1 1/2 cup bread flour 1 1/2 cup graham (whole wheat) flour 1/2 cup rye flour (use the coarse grind, preferably) 2 TB wheat gluten (sometime called vital wheat gluten) 1 tsp salt 1 TB honey 1 2/3 cup water Add ingredients in order suggested by your bread machine manual. This is intended for a 3 cup bread maker, if your machine is smaller just scale it accordingly. Similarly, your bread maker may suggest using less than 1 TB yeast. For a particularly festive bread try adding 1 TB basil 1 TB tarragon 1 tsp rosemary chopped garlic...

    <title>Arizona Desert Chili</title>
    <category>Meats</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 Garlic cloves; chopped</li>
      <li>2 Onions; chopped</li>
      <li>1 Green bell peppers; chopped</li>
      <li>3 pounds Beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground oregano</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Chili powder</li>
      <li>10 Tomatoes; peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>2 Jalapeño peppers; optional</li>
      <li>1 can Beer</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Have beef chopped, not ground. 1. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add garlic, onions and green pepper. Sauté until soft, about 5-7 minutes. 2. Add beef and lightly brown on all surfaces. Drain off some of the fat if a lot has accumulated. Lean beef trimmed of all fat should not have an excess amount, however. 3. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 1 hour or slightly longer. Put a cover on skillet during cooking time, and slightly tilt it so steam can escape. Check often and stir to prevent sticking. Skim off fat as it rises. Best if allowed to sit, tightly covered, for an hour after cooking is complete. Serving Ideas : Serve with cornbread or cheese biscuits. NOTES : This chili can be mild or very hot depending upon the use of jalapeño peppers. Some chili lovers say you should never put beans in chili so this recipe omits them. This recipe is from a truck driver named Sparky that we met in Arizona, a firm believer in no-bean chili.

      <li>Date: Thu, 21 Mar 1996 14:22:39 -0500 From: Dotnapier@aol.com Posted by Ari Kornfeld &lt;ari@perspective.com&gt; to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 15 Issue 23] Feb. 23, 1995. Here are my favorite tips and basic bread recipe: 1. Don't by those tiny packets of active-dry yeast. Get it in bulk in a health-food store. They charge at least 10x more for those tiny packets -- you're paying almost entirely for the packaging. (Store yeast in the fridge.) 1 packet=1 TB. 2. Wheat gluten is very useful in helping the dough rise. I add around 1 TB per cup of non-bread flour ingredients. 3. Oil is NOT necessary and actually detracts from the taste. All you really need for good bread is flour, salt, yeast, and water. Everything else is optional. 4. The best breads are simply a mix of flours (whole wheat, rye, oats, corn, buckwheat, rice, or whatever you like). Remember thought that wheat flours are necessary for the gluten content, unless you add gluten separately. Adding fruits and herbs and flavored liquids are interesting but I prefer "pure" breads. I prefer graham flour over regular whole wheat. 5. Each machine is different and my recipes are usually not exact -- if the dough looks sticky and isn't forming a ball then it's too wet: add more flour; if it looks dry (ball doesn't have a relatively smooth surface, for example) add more liquid a tablespoon or two at a time.

      <li>Pierce the liver with a knife, cut open the heart and fry them together in a little hot oil for a few minutes. Pass them with the kidneys through a coarse grinder. In Greece we would also use the lungs - but in NY it is against the health code to sell them. Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy frying pan and saute the onions until transparent. Add the meat, dill parsley, and salt and pepper. Stir in well and saute gently for 15 minutes. Add a little water to moisten and cook until the meat is tender. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with chopped walnuts. Serve warm or cold. Serves 4-6. NOTES: A traditional Sephardic recipe. This fufills the injunction in the Torah: And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of raw, nor sodden at with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and all of the innards thereof. And ye shall leave none of it remaining until morning.

      <li>Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Just in case you haven't noticed, a traditionally Greek Easter is an event whereby the guests primary goals are to eat and eat and drink themselves to exhaustion. After all, it's a celebration of great magnitude and like most big holidays, draws guests and family members together for a day or two, from far and wide. Now if you're one of those cooks that doesn't happen to have an open-fire spit in your back garden, have no fear. We've updated today's recipe to be prepared in the oven. However, feel freely to dig the pit and prepare the spit if you so desire. Cooking time is about a day-and-a-half! To prepare the marinade, finely chop 8 cloves of garlic and place in a pan that is large enough to hold the lamb. Add 2 Tbs. oregano, 2 Tbs. rosemary, 6 Tbs. olive oil, 1 cup lemon juice, wine or apple juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly and place the lamb in the marinade, turning to coat well on both sides. Cover and set aside in the refrigerator overnight. Crush 6 cloves of garlic and the remaining oregano and rosemary together with a mortar and pestle or chop them finely and combine thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Pre-heat oven to 375-F degrees. Remove lamb from marinade and pierce in a dozen places with a paring knife. Rub the garlic and herb mixture all over the lamb, pressing the mixture firmly into the cuts with your fingers. Coat surface of the lamb with about 4 Tbs. olive oil. Mix remaining olive oil and lemon juice together in a bowl. Crush remaining garlic and place in a large roasting pan and add potatoes. Place lamb on top of the potatoes and roast, basting frequently with the lemon mixture and turning the potatoes occasionally, for 1 hour and 45-minutes. Remove lamb from the oven and let rest for about 10-minutes, keeping potatoes warm in the oven that you turned off when you removed the lamb. Carve leg of lamb and serve with potatoes.

      <li>Cut lamb into serving-size strips. Place in pot with the butter. Clean scallions; chop the white part into small pcs. and the greens into larger ones (abt. 1 1/2" long); add to meat. Add 1/2 c. water and a little coarse salt; cook over med. heat for abt. 1 hr. Clean lettuce and cut into 2-inch pcs. As soon as meat has absorbed the water it will begin to brown in the butter but do not let the scallions brown. Add dill, lettuce, salt &amp; pepper. Cover pot and simmer over low heat for abt. 15 min. If it is needed, add a little water toward the end of the cooking time (not in the beginning, because then the lettuce will exude water). Beat egg yolks with 2 tb. of water, add the juice from the lemons, and beat it in well. Add a little of the liquid from the pot, beating constantly. Pour this sauce back into the pot and shake the pot gently to mix the sauce with the food. Serve immediately. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Lard; chilled</li>
      <li>3 Eggs; lightly beaten</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Vinegar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 ounces Unsweetened chocolate</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Dark corn syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Brown sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Rum</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Chopped pecans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the salt into the flour and cut in the lard. Measure out 1 tablespoon of the beaten eggs into a small bowl and reserve the remaining eggs. Add the water and vinegar to the bowl and stir. Slowly add the liquid to the flour and lard, just until the mixture holds together to form a dough. Lightly flour a work surface and rolling pin and roll the dough into an 11-inch circle. Fit it into a 9-inch pie pan and refrigerate it if you plan to finish the pie after several hours, or freeze it if you are completing the recipe at this point. This will prevent shrinkage. Melt the chocolate and butter together in a heavy saucepan. Set aside and allow to cool. Stir the corn syrup and sugar into the reserved eggs. Add the chocolate and butter, vanilla, rum and the pecans. Mix well and pour into the pie shell. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until set. The filling will rise and then fall. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Whipped Cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Shortbread Crust: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Working on a large flat surface, such as a pastry board, place flour, pecans, and sugar in the center of the surface and mix together. Form a small depression or well in the center of the mound. Add the egg yolk and the softened butter to the well, then blend these with the dry mixture. Mix the ingredients thoroughly using your hands -- there is no substitute for warm hands. Shape the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 10 minutes. Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. You should have a circle of about 11 inches in diameter. For best results, roll out your dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in a 9 inch circle. Place the circle inside a 9 inch springform pan. Prick the crust several times with a fork to keep the crust from puffing up during the baking. Place the springform pan in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Allow to cool. Using the leftover dough, line the sides of the springform pan. Press the dough against the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as to have a continuous layer of crust all the way around the sides of the pan. Make sure that the side crust meets the bottom crust all the way around. Brush the reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the bottom and sides. This will seal the dough and keep it from becoming soggy. Set aside until ready to use. Cranberry Glaze Filling: Mix the sugar and cornstarch together in a small saucepan. Stir in the cranberry sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice. Set aside to cool slightly. White Chocolate Filling: Reset the oven to 350 degrees F. Boil the orange juice and piece of orange peel in a heavy medium saucepan until the juice is reduced to 3 Tbsp - about 12 minutes. Remove and discard the strip of orange peel and set aside the reduced orange juice. Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, sugar, grated orange zest, Crantasia, and reduced orange juice until smooth. Beat in the melted white chocolate and then the eggs, one at a time, beating just until combined. Pour the cranberry glaze filling into the prepared crust, spreading evenly. Pour the white chocolate filling over the cranberry layer and bake about 50 minutes (the top will be dry and the sides puffed slightly - the center will not be set). Move cheesecake to a wire rack and cool completely to room temperature. Chill in the refrigerator overnight. Candied Oranges Topping: Cover a wire rack with waxed paper. Set aside. Combine the water and sugar in a heavy shallow wide skillet. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Simmer 5 minutes longer. Add the orange slices 1 at a time and adjust the heat so that the syrup bubbles only around the edges of the pan. Cook the oranges for one hour. Turn over the top layer of oranges and cook until the oranges are translucent and the orange peels tender, about another one hour longer. Lift and drain each orange slice out of the syrup, and arrange the slices in a single layer on the prepared rack. Let dry 1 hour. Boil the orange-sugar syrup until thick, about 6 minutes. Loosen and remove the sides of the springform pan. Set the cheesecake on a serving dish. Overlap the candied orange slices around the top of the cheesecake. Reheat the orange syrup, if necessary, and brush over the orange slices. Drizzle any remainder over each serving. Garnish: whipped cream NOTE: You may substitute grapefruits for the oranges in the Candied Oranges Topping if you prefer. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>2 packages Oven fry coating mix (pork flavor)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Note: Enough talk about Chili Poppers. Try an Aramdillo Egg! Its a great recipe that I got from the Sept/Oct 1990 issue of Chile Pepper Magazine (I've been subscribing for years!) This is still one of my favorite recipes from the mag. They suggest Cadillac Bar Poppers as a libation w/your Armadillo Eggs. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grate 2 oz. of cheese and set aside. Grate the other 6 ozs of cheese and mix it with the sausage and Bisquick. Knead well and set aside. Slit and scrape seeds from each jalapeno pepper, leaving the stems on. Rinse the jalapenos and stuff each with some of the 2 ozs of cheese that was set aside. Separate the sausage dough into patties and form around the stuffed pods. Made sure the ends are closed and only the stems are showing. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and set aside. Spread coating mix on a plate. Dip each covered pepper into egg and roll in coating mix. Bake on cookie sheet for 30 minutes, turning each one over after 15 mintues. Serves 6 as appetizer. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>Place the onion rings in a sieve or colander, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the salt, and turn them about with a spoon to coat them evenly. Let them rest at room temperature for 30 minutes, then rinse under warm running water and squeeze them gently but completely dry. In a large bowl, toss the onions, parsley and red pepper together until well mixed. Set aside. Drop the liver into a bowl, pour in the raki and stir together for a few seconds. Then pour off the raki. Toss the liver and flour together in another bowl, place the liver in a sieve and shake through all the excess flour. In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat the oil over high heat until a light haze forms above it. Add the liver and stir it about in the hot oil for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the cubes are lightly browned. Stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few grindings of pepper. With a slotted spoon, transfer the liver to paper towels to drain. Mound the liver in the center of a heated platter, arrange the onion-ring mixture and red pepper strips around it and serve at once.

    <title>Ariel's Peppercorn Steak (Or Steak Au Poivre)</title>
    <category>Main dish</category>
    <category>Meats</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 to 12 oz New York Sirloin</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Teriyaki Sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce</li>
      <li>Coarsely Crushed Peppercorns</li>
      <li>Red Wine</li>
      <li>Cream</li>
      <li>Cognac</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1) Combine olive oil, teriyaki and worcestershire sauces to form a marinade for the meat. Or, you may use a marinade recipe of your choice. Marinade the steak at least a few hours, or overnight in the fridge turning the meat occasionally. 2) Crush enough peppercorns to cover the steak on both sides. Put the crushed peppercorns on a cutting board and press the steak onto the peppercorns to coat. Do the same for both sides of the steak. 3) Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron with grill lines) and plop the steak into it. Depending on the meat and the marinade, you may have to add a bit of oil. 4) Cook both sides evenly until the meat is medium rare, or to your liking. 5) Put the meat on a heated plate. Keep the liquid in the skillet and add some wine to deglaze the skillet. (ie collect all the remains into a sauce). Cook (fairly high heat) until the sauce thickens, stirring occasionally. 6) For more sauce, or Steak au Poivre la Creme, add cream and cook a little longer. Usually you need to do this to thicken the sauce. 7) Add cognac, cook some more. Sauce should always be thick. Pour sauce over steak and optionally flambe in cognac (Steak au Poivre Flambe). Serve with Parisienne potatoes and carrots.</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Saute rice and vermicelli; stirring constantly, in olive oil or butter in nonstick pan until rice is translucent, about 2 minutes. Combine rice and vermicelli with broth in steaming pan; season to taste. Cover and steam until rice is done, 18 to 20 minutes. Uncover and allow to dry out, 3 to 5 minutes. Fluff with fork before serving. Variations: * Turkish cooks sometimes chop and add the white parts of a few scallions at the end of the steaming step. * Substitute 1/2 cup fine egg noodles for vermicelli.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 F. Prick eggplant with a fork in 10-12 places and rub with olive oil. Bake uncovered for about an hour, or until the pulp feels quite soft. Scoop out the pulp and place in a small saucepan. Add lemon juice and cook over medium heat until the water has evaporated - about 5 minutes. Saute the onion in butter. Blend enough of the flour in to make a thick roux, then add milk slowly to form a thick sauce. Beat lightly into the eggplant. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add the Parmesan cheese and a few drops of warm milk if dip is too thick. Store overnight in the refrigerator but bring to room temperature before serving with crackers, bagel chips, or strips of crisped pita.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Serves: 4-6 Cooking time: 1 3/4 to 2 hours In a heavy-based saucepan or Dutch oven gently fry onion in butter until transparent. Increase heat and add cubed lamb. Cook, stirring constantly, until meat juices evaporate. Meat should not brown. Reduce heat and add hot water, herbs and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer gently for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add prepared vegetable and continue to cook until lambe and vegetables are tender. Carefully drain liquid from pan into a measuring jug and make up to 1 1/2 cups with hot water or stock. Keep pan contents hot. Make Egg and Lemon Sauce: Bring stock to the boil. Mix cornflour to a paste with a little cold water and add to stock, stirring until thickened and bubbling. Let it boil for 1 minute. In a bowl, beat egg whites until stiff, add egg yolks and continue beating until light and fluffy. Add lemon juice gradually, beating constantly. Gradually pour in boiling, thickened stock, beating constantly. Return sauce to pan and cook, stirring constantly, over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the egg. Do not allow sauce to boil. Remove from heat and continue to stir for 1 minute. Season to taste. Pour Egg and Lemon Sauce over lamb and vegetable, cover and leave at the side of the stove for 5 minutes. Arrange lamb and vegetable on a serving dish and sprinkle with chopped herb. Serve immediately with crusty bread and a chilled white wine. *Note: Use any one of the following for the vegetable: 8-12 small globe artichoke hearts. Add to meat about 1 hour and cook for further 30-45 minutes. 500 g (1 lb) celery stalks cut into 8 cm (3 inch) lengths and blanched in boiling, salted water for 5 minutes.

      <li>1/2 cups Olive oil</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut lamb into 1 1/2 inch cubes and place in a non-reactive (glass or earthenware) dish. Add remaining ingredients to lamb, mix well to coat meat, and cover. You can also place all ingredients in a heavy plastic bag and seal. Leave in refrigerator to marinate for 12-24 hours, stirring meat occasionally. Lift lamb out of marinade and thread onto metal skewers. Pieces of bay leaf may be placed between lamb cubes. Since most vegetables have different cooking times, I would suggest that you skewer peppers, onions, etc. separately and serve them together with the lamb. If you wish these may be marinated also (in a separate bag.) Cook under a hot broiler or over glowing charcoal, turning and basting frequently with marinade. I like this best medium rare. Keep checking the meat -- the cooking time will vary because charcoal fires are so variable. Place on a platter and garnish with parsley and lemon wedges. Serves 6-8.

      <li>Date: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 19:09:50 -0400 From: Jim Porter &lt;jporter@pbsj.com&gt; Here is a breakfast dish that was in Southern Living magazine this spring, published from /The Dairy Hollow House Cookbook/. I originally (before finding this list) made it according to the recipe -- not fat-free. For this past Sunday's breakfast I trimmed it back, and it came out just as well. I thought you might enjoy it too. This is basically a big, puffy pancake that you cover with sauteed apples and slice into wedges. For the apple filling, I just modified the (microwave) "sauteed" apples recipe posted in the archives (courtesy Asha Dornfest), instead of sauteeing with 1/4 c of butter. (Spray "skillet" with cooking spray.) HEAT a 12-inch cast-iron skillet in a 450 degree oven for 5 mins. (I just used my chili pot, with the plastic handles removed. You'll want something a little deep, as this pancake puffs-up when cooking) COMBINE first 3 ingredients in a mixing bowl; beat at medium speed with electric mixer until smooth. Add flour and salt; beat 5 mins. POUR batter into hot skillet. Bake at 450 for 15 mins.; reduce heat to 350, and bake 8 mins., or until puffed and browned. Remove from oven; spoon Apple Filling over pancake (pancake will deflate). Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Cut into wedges, and serve immediately. Yield 4 servings. APPLE FILLING: Place apples in microwavable container with a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkling of cinnamon (and Butter Buds, if you like). Cook on high for 4 minutes, or more -- till desired tenderness (I cook it longer (double?, stirring after half the time), as I like them tender. Remove from microwave; stir in honey, and let sit till you are ready to use. FATFREE DIGEST V96 #175 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>8 Loin lamb chops</li>
      <li>18 Sheets commercial phyllo</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Butter; hot and melted</li>
      <li>2 cups Peas; cooked and drained</li>
      <li>16 Potato balls; parboiled</li>
      <li>16 Cherry tomatoes; peeled</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Kasseri cheese; in 8 pieces</li>
      <li>Salt &amp; freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 pinch Dried oregano</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note: 3/4-inch slices leg of lamb may be used instead of lamb chops. In a heavy skillet, heat the oil or butter and fry the lamb over high heat, turning frequently. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, unroll the filo sheets and cover with a damp towel. In a small pan over low heat, have the butter hot without letting it brown. Remove two sheets of filo, brush with hot butter over the first, then cover with the second sheet and brush it with butter. In the center of the buttered filo place 1 lamb chop, 2 tablspoons peas, 2 potato balls, 2 cherry tomatoes, and a slice of kasseri. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, a heaping tablespoon of parsley, and a pinch of oregano. Fold the filo around the lamb and vegetables like a sealed parcel. Place, seam side down, on a buttered baking pan (approximately 11 x 15 x 3 inches) and set aside while you repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients to make 8 "parcels". Brush hot butter on the tops, then bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden in color. Remove from the oven and arrange on a warm platter or on individual dishes. Serve warm, with a fresh-cooked or raw vegetable salad. Note: The vegetables and herbs may be varied. Substitute green beans or lima beans for peas, use thyme or basil instead of oregano. Arni Exohiko is frequently prepared using buttered waxed paper, parchment paper or aluminum foil rather than with filo. From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.

      <li>2 tablespoons Salt</li>

      <li>Today, I have two picnics just kicking along at about 8 seconds by the palm test (225º) to make Eastern NC style pulled pork. They will be ready sometime during tonight's poker game. Trying something different on these. Normally I only use a little salt and pepper on picnics, butts, and shoulders or do them naked. Last night I rubbed one with my salt, molasses and pepper cure and the other with Leggs Old Plantation sausage seasoning. I don't use any baste or mop. When I pull and chop my pork, I mix in a thin infusion sauce in the Eastern NC tradition while the meat is still hot. The basic "sauce" (actually sauce is not the right term for something this thin) is based on those from Dave Lineback's site: Preparation: Combine all ingredients and let stand several hours before using. Since I am in the experiment mode, I added 1/2 pint water, 1 tsp celery seed, and a dollop (maybe 1 Tbsp) molasses. In deference to former list member and keeper of the recipes, Tom Solomon, I also added 1 tsp nuok mam to half of this. The Nuok mam actually made a pleasant addition, rounding out the flavors nicely. I will keep enough in the refrigerator to last for about two weeks and freeze the rest.

Turn bag several times to coat chicken well. Refrigerate, turning occasionally, at least 4 hours or overnight. Refrigerate remaining marinade in separate covered container. Prepare grill, placing coals to one side; heat until coals are ash white. Make aluminum foil drip pan; place opposite coals. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Place chicken on grill over drip pan. Grill, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink (15 to 20 minutes). Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan cook remaining marinade over medium heat until mixture comes to a full boil (2 or 3 minutes). Continue cooking until slightly reduced (7 to 8 minutes). Drizzle over chicken. Broiling Directions. Prepare chicken as directed above. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until chicken is no longer pink (12 to 14 minutes). Continue as directed above.

If using a charcoal grill, open all the vents, divide charcoal briquets evenly and arrange them in the grill, leaving space in the center. Light the coals. When they are ash white, place a foil drip pan between the coals and put the cooking grate in place. Set the food on the center of the grate, then put the lid on the grill. Don't lift the lid or turn the meat unless the recipe instructs.

    <recipetext>
      <li>2 dz large shrimp with : heads and shells : (about 1 pound) : Seasoning mix 1 ts red pepper (cayenne) 1 ts black pepper 1/2 ts salt 1/2 ts crushed red pepper 1/2 ts dried thyme leaves 1/2 ts dried rosemary leaves, : crushed 1/2 ts dried oregano leaves 1/4 lb plus 5 tb unsalted butter 1-1/2 ts minced garlic 1 ts Worcestershire sauce 1/2 c shrimp stock (see below) 1/4 beer at room temperature : Shrimp Stock 2 qt cold water 2 lb rinsed shrimp heads : and/or shells Rinse shrimp in cold water and drain well. Pinch off and discard head, but leave as much of the fat in the head attached to the body (I said it would taste good; not that it would be good for you!). In a small bowl combine the seasoning mix ingredients. Combine 1 stick of the butter, the garlic, Worcestershire, and seasoning mix in a large skillet over high heat. When the butter is melted, add the shrimp. Cook for 2 minutes, shaking the pan (versus stirring) in a back-and-forth motion. Add the remaining 5 tbsp butter and the stock; cook and shake pan for 2 minutes. Add the beer and cook and shake the pan 1 minute longer. Remove from heat. Serve immediately in bowls with lots of French bread (use the bread to soak up the sauce!). Shrimp Stock Place water and shrimp parts in a stock pot or large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours, preferably 8, replenishing the water as needed to keep about 1 quart of liquid in the pan. The pot may be uncovered or set a lid on it askew. Strain, cool, and refrigerate until ready to use. If in a hurry, simmer 20 to 30 minutes. Walt MM Enjoy!!!

    <recipetext>
      <li>SERVES 6-8 I owe this dish to a friend, Brian. He will put anything in his barbecue except the neighbor's dog. He can eat three meals a day out of his cooker, so I was anxious to respond to his dinner invitation. This recipe was particularly unusual and delicious. It is just too simple to believe. Bake the potatoes in their skins about 30 minutes at 450ø, or until they are just slightly tender. Do not fully cook them as they must be sliced. While still a bit hot, cut the potatoes lengthwise in half and then each half into quarters. Place the pieces in a glass baking dish and cover with the dressing. Let stand 1 hour, turning once. Remove from the dressing and place on the grill. Salt and pepper to taste and grill the pieces until golden brown, about 10 minutes on each side. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>This is a simple recipe that you can use to add a bit of color to the barbecue buffet. Purchase large shrimp in the shell and skewer them on bamboo barbecue sticks. Place them in your cooker when everything else is just about finished. They will take only a few minutes to cook and the smoke flavor on the shrimp is just wonderful. Be careful not to overcook this delicacy. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Large shrimp; shells on</li>
      <li>8 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>4 Shallots</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Fresh oregano leaves; chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Unsalted butter; softened</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Freshly ground white pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>2 Lemon; cut in wedges</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Using small, sharp scissors, snip along the top ridge of each shrimp shell. Using a small knife, cut into the top surface of the shrimp to reveal the vein, then rinse it away. In a food processor, mince the garlic, shallots, oregano and thyme. Add the butter, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and peppers and process until thoroughly blended. Fit the Creole Butter between the shell and shrimp and refrigerate. Set aside the lemon wedges. The recipe up to this point can be completed 8 hours in advance of cooking. Preheat a gas grill to medium (350#161#F). When the grill is preheated, brush it with oil, then place the shrimp on the grill. When the shells turn pink on the underside, turn the shrimp over. Cut into a shrimp to test for doneness. The shrimp are done when the shells turn pink and the shrimp meat has lost its raw inside color, about 6 minutes. (Alternatively, preheat the oven to 500#161#F. Then turn the oven setting to broil and broil the shrimp 4 inches from the heat for about 6 minutes.) Serve the shrimp immediately on 4 heated dinner plates accompanied by lemon wedges and napkins.</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior. The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days. On day one, prepare the dipping sauce and condiments. The Vegetable Platter and shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil, crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20 minutes. Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and squeeze between your hands to remove excess water. Dry thoroughly with paper towels. Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes. Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides. The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed. Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane, split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small bowl. Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane. Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil. Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil, crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm. Pour the peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner plate. Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some noodles and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from the sugar cane, are added. The rice paper is then roiled up to form a neat package. The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out of hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types of sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers. Shape the shrimp paste into meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Marinade for barbecued pork</li>
      <li>Pork</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Cut pork in strips 2 inches wide, 2 inches thick and 5 inches long. 2. Prepare any of the marinades for barbecued pork strips (see recipes below). Add to pork and let stand 2 hours, turning meat frequently. Drain, reserving marinade. 3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place pork strips on a rack over a shallow roasting pan containing a few inches of water; or suspend, barbecue-style, in oven. (See HOW-TO SECTION.) Roast 10 minutes. 4. Reduce heat to 325 degrees and roast pork 30 to 40 minutes more. (Turn meat several times if not suspended.) Baste strips lightly at 5-minute intervals with peanut or sesame oil; or glaze with a thin layer of honey during the last 10 minutes of roasting. 5. Cut pork against the grain in bite-size pieces. Serve hot with reheated marinade; or cold with plum sauce, hot Chinese mustard (see recipe) or a soy sauce dip. NOTE: Barbecued Pork Strips may be used in any dish that calls for roast pork. They can be prepared in quantity and refrigerated (they will keep about a week) or frozen in foil. (If frozen, reheat in foil without defrosting.) VARIATIONS: Marinate a whole pork tenderloin. Roast 30 minutes at 375 degrees; 1 hour at 300 degrees. If meat is on a rack, turn at 15-minute intervals. (If suspended barbecue-style, turning isn't necessary.) Roast the marinated pork strips 15 minutes at 350 degrees; then raise heat to 450, baste with peanut oil and roast 1o minutes more. (This will make pork very crisp.) Cook the marinated pork strips over a hibachi, or charcoal grill, etc., allowing about 15 minutes on each side. Broil the marinated pork strips 25 minutes, turning once. (Place about 1-1/2 inches from flame.) Baste with the marinade at 5-minute intervals. For marinades, see one of the "marinade" for Barbecued Pork recipes: Basic, Sugar-Soy, Spiced, Pineapple-Sherry, Garlic-Onion, Hoisin-Five Spices, Hoisin-Chili, Sherry-Brown Sugar, Soy-Sherry, Five Spices, Sherry-Honey, Soy-Sugar or Brown Bean.

      <li>In heavy 9-inch skillet, heat oil over medium heat. With fork, pierce sausages all over serveral times. Add sausages and onion; cook, turning sausages and stirring onion occasionally, until lightly browned--about 4 minutes.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 21:12:54 -0500 (EST) From: Trish &lt;TRISHMCKENNA@delphi.com&gt; Cut onions in half lengthwise, slice in 1/4" slices, halve the slices and separate into rings. Trim all possible fat from roast and sprinkle with garlic salt and seasoned pepper. Place half the onions in crockpot, put in roast and top with rest of onions. Pour 1 cup of soda over all, cover and cook on LOW for 10 to 12 hours, or overnight until pork can be easily shredded with two forks. Remove pork from pot, shred in a bowl, removing all possible fat. Remove onions with slotted spoon and add to bowl. Discard juice in pot. Return onions and pork to pot, add BBQ sauce to all and mix. Continue to cook on LOW for 5 to 6 hours, adding more BBQ sauce as needed. Serve as sandwiches in buns. (I use Pepperidge Fram Sandwich rolls). Leftovers may be cooled, made into sandwiches, wrapped in heavy plastic wrap and frozen individually for later use. (I store them in the sandwich roll bags, 8 to a bag, sealed with the tab that came with the bag). They keep well and may be unwrapped, rewrapped in paper towels and heated in a microwave at 50% for a few minutes. NOTE: Idea from Laurie Robinson (SNMJ29D) 01/14/93: "I made up a batch of BBQ pork but did not have enough rolls to freeze it with. I put globs of it on cookie sheets and froze them for a day. Then I put the globs into zip lock baggies and popped them in the freezer. I have used a glob on a baked potato for lunch (terrific), and sent some to work with my hubby with fresh rolls for the microwave. These globs take very little space in the freezer and are very convenient for use." Wonderful idea!

      <li>recipe from Bradley Ogden's Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner In a medium mixing bowl sift together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl combine the egg, milk, and melted butter. Make a well in the dry ingredients and gradually beat in the egg mixture. Stir in the chives. Let the batter rest for 30 minutes before using. Heat a well-seasoned crepe pan over medium heat until almost smoking. Butter lightly and pour in about 2 tablespoons of batter, just enough to make a thin 5-inch crepe, tilting the pan to distribute the batter evenly. Bake until golden brown, cooking on one side only. Remove the crepe from the pan and continue with the remaining batter, stacking the warm crepes on a plate. Heat the barbecue sauce in a medium saucepan and add the shredded pork. Stir to coat the pork evenly with the sauce. Simmer gently for a few minutes to make sure the meat is heated through. Fold or roll the crepes around the filling. Top with any remaining barbecue sauce and serve the avocado salsa on the side. Avocado Salsa (makes 2 cups): In a medium-size bowl, mix the minced white onion and 2 tablespoons of the lime juice. Set aside while preparing the tomato and avocados. Core and cut the tomato into 1/4-inch dice. Cut the avocados in half, remove the seeds, scoop out the flesh. Cut the flesh into 1/2-inch dice. add the tomato, avocado, minced chilies and cilantor to the onion mixture. Taste for seasoning and add salt, lime juice or minced chili as needed. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the salsa stand for about 1/2 hour before serving. Barbecue Sauce (makes 2 cups): Combine all the ingredients in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and put through a fine strainer. Refrigerate if not using immediately. Sauce will keep in regfrigerator for up to 4 days.

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt peter*</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Probably optional. PREPARATION: Cut pork butt into 4 inch by 2 inch by 1 inch strips. Mix rest of ingredients and rub over pork pieces. Marinate at least 4 hours or overnight. COOKING: Preheat oven at 375 degrees. Line roasting pan with foil and place pork on roasting rack. Roast a total of 45 minutes, turning over once or twice. DO-AHEAD NOTES: Barbecued pork can be made anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks in advance. Just wrap and freeze. For cold appetizers, thaw, then slice just before serving. To reheat, thaw first and reheat in a slow oven until just heated through (about 20 minutes). Delicious either way. COMMENTS: Barbecued pork can be used in fried rice, egg rolls, filling for steamed pork buns, stir fry with vegetables and as garnishes for many noodle dishes. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee.

The recipes were published in the 7-13-94 issue of the Tyler Courier-Times. Both Pam and her mother are known by the family and their friends for their cooking. (Not the low fat low cal kind) Sorry the article does not state the serving size or time, but it does say the total time to prepare the whole meal is 45 minutes (preparing dishes before baking). Mix ingredients and pour over shrimp in casserole dish. Marinade at least one hour in refrigerator (preferably overnight). Bring back to room temperature and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes for 3 pounds of shrimp or a little longer for 5 pounds.

      <li>1 teaspoon Dry mustard</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Rosemary (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>We attribute this recipe to the Mennonite colony of Ontario. It's often served at picnics and is known as one of the favorite foods at stag parties. Prepare pigs' tails according to Step I in basic instructions; cut in 3-inch pieces. Place pigs' tails on a rack and bake in a 300F oven for 2 to 3 hours, until meat is tender and most of the fat has baked off. An alternate method to this is to simmer the pigs' tails in acidulated water for 1 1/2 hours. Combine all other ingredients for barbecue sauce, coating tails well. Grill over hot charcoal, turning and basting, until crisp. If fresh rosemary is available, break off several branches, tie them together and use as a basting brush. For barbecuing, we prefer leaving the tails uncut or halved so as to have fewer piece to constantly turn. Serve with traditional barbecue accompaniments such as corn-on-the- cob, French bread and green salad. Serves 6 to 8. All these recipes are from "Innards and Other Variety Meats".

Roast the pork at 350F for 45 minutes, basting occasionally with the malt sugar or honey. Increase the heat to 425F and roast for 20 minutes to finish the pork. When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut it into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange the pork slices on a platter. Serves 4 to 6 as a main course accompanied by vegetables, 8 to 10 as an appetizer.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From Will Greenwood, not-quite White House chef. For the rub: Combine the chili, garlic and onion powders, the sugar, salt, allspice, cumin, white pepper and paprika in a food processor until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rub on all sides of the salmon. Let fillets marinate for 6 hours. To cook the salmon: Prepare a very hot grill. If you are using wood chips on the hot coals, first soak these in water so they will smoke more. Add soaked chips 5 minutes before starting the salmon. Rub the fillets with a thin film of olive oil. Grill them approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness. For the field greens and vinaigrette: Clean and refresh the greens in cold water. Spin dry. Mix the vegetable juice, vinegar and tomato together with the reserved barbecue rub and olive oil. Toss with the greens. To serve: Divide greens among plates. Top each plate with a salmon fillet. Spoon the remaining vinaigrette in the bowl over the salmon. Serve hot.

Immediately add the broth, water, catsup, tomato paste, mustard, Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and pepper and bring to a boil. Add the ribs and cook 20 minutes. (If using chicken, cook for 10 minutes.) Remove from heat, remove the ribs from the liquid and place covered in the refrigerator. Cook the liquid over medium heat until it becomes thick and syrupy. The next day, light a charcoal grill. Place the ribs on the grill so they are not directly over the coals and cover the grill so that smoke collects inside. If your grill does not have a cover, improvise one out of aluminium foil. Cook for 40 minutes, basting with barbecue sauce every 10 minutes. When ribs are well heated, remove to a platter and serve. Offer any additional barbecue sauce on the side. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: TOMATO BARBEQUE SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 cup Tomato ketchup</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Salt and pepper pork ribs. Barbeque ribs on coals until ready. Then baste with the sauce. Mix sauce well. Remove ribs from the coals and quickly apply the tomato basting sauce, using a barbeque brush, covering the whole rib on both sides. Return ribs to coals and continue barbequeing each side for two minutes only. Remove, cut and serve. The tomato barbeque sauce should be applied to the ribs after they have been barbequed to perfection, and each treated side barbequed for only 2 minutes more after applying the tomato basting sauce. This is the secret of perfectly barbequed pork spareribs: if the sauce is applied whilst the meat is still raw, or if a side is facing the coals for more than 2 minutes after brushing on the tomato basting sauce, the tomato in the sauce tends to turn to charcoal.
