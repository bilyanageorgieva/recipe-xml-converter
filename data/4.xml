    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Short grain brown rice</li>
      <li>(measure uncooked)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Onion (finely diced)</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Carrot (minced or grated)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Dry basil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Dry thyme</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Black pepper (coarse grind)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Tamari</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cook the rice so that it comes out a bit dry (if it is very sticky and damp let it dry some by spreading it on a tray for a while.) After the rice cools, add all other ingredients, mix well, and sort of knead the mixture a bit until it feels a bit sticky. Form into patties about 4 inches round and about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick (don't make them to thin). Place on a nonstick baking sheet, and put into a preheated 450 degree oven. Let cook for about 25 minutes, flip and cook for another 10 to 15 minutes. If the mixture was too wet the burgers will kind of flow and get thin. When you are making the patties you will probably think that this can't be done. My family loves these with onion tomato and coarse mustard. Thanks to a kind person at the local Wellspring Grocery and Deli who was kind enough to share a recipe with their customers. From: andrew.jones@downtown.durham.nc.us.

      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Wine, white, dry</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Vermouth</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Almonds, coarsely ground</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make a deep incision down the center of the veal, being careful not to cut all the way through; gently open it out flat as you would a book. Trim off and reserve any irregular pieces of meat along the edges, leaving a neat, compact shape. Place rosemary along the center of the meat. Top the meat with half of the pancetta, overlapping the slices. Sprinkle with parsley and top with remaining pancetta, bay leaves, nutmeg and pepper. Drain the porcini mushrooms, reserving and straining the liquid. Rinse the porcini in cool water, drain again, chop coarsely and place on the top of the meat. Top with any reserved meat trimmings. Close up meat compactly and tie with kitchen twine, going once around lengthwise and several times around crosswise. Pat dry. Melt the butter in a deep casserole over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until golden, about 6 minutes, then discard the garlic. Add the stuffed roast, season with salt, and cook until lightly golden on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes. Add wine and vermouth, basting the meat. Cover the casserole, lower heat to medium low and cook, turning and basting occasionally, for 15 minutes. Stir in the almonds and 1/2 cup of reserved mushroom-soaking liquid. Cook, turning and basting occasionally, until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes longer. Transfer the meat to carving board and let it stand for 10 minutes or longer. Boil the sauce until lightly reduced. Cut the roast into 1/2-inch-thick slices; if necessary, reheat the slices in the casserole. Spoon sauce over and serve.

      <li>1 teaspoon Dry Mustard</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Red Wine Vinegar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Sunflower Or Corn Oil</li>
      <li>Salt And Freshly Ground Black Pepper; To Taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Beet should be washed and dried. If you are using a fresh beet, preheat the oven to 375 Degrees F. Wrap the beet in aluminum foil and bake until tender, about 1 1/4 hours. When the beet is cool enough to handle, peel it and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 10 minutes. Add the carrots and cook until the vegetables are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes more. Let cool until easy to handle, then cut the vegetables into 1/2-inch dice. In a large salad bowl, combine the potatoes, carrots, onion, pickles, peas, beet, scallions, and dill. Season with salt and pepper and toss gently, taking care not to crush the vegetables. In a small bowl, whisk the dry mustard, sugar and vinegar together. Whisk in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss the salad with the dressing and tasting to correct the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. Makes 4 generous servings. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Violet Vinegar</title>

    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 cups Wild purple violets</li>
      <li>4 cups Rice vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pack 2 pint jars tightly with the violets. Pour the vinegar (unheated) over the violets. Cover tightly and allow to stand in a sunny window for 4 or 5 days; the violets will bleach out and the vinegar become a marvelous pale lavender. Strain and keep refrigerated. NOTE: The original recipe called for cider vinegar, but to capture the delicate color and flavor of the violets, I use Japanese rice vinegar, which is not as strong or as dark as cider vinegar. 1991 ADAMS, Marcia Heartland Clarkson Potter/ Publisher.

I use less sugar, but if sweet is what you want, this is it. You can use oranges, peaches apricots, plums, etc. Do not peel the fruit first.

Yesterday I got my latest order from the Dixie Diners' Club (800-347-3494); they carry a tremendous selection of FF vegetarian stuff and their prices are reasonable. They also toss in a booklet of recipes with each order, and lo and behold! This was in the latest issue. I haven't tried these as I'm not into sausage and biscuits. Enjoy! Biscuits: Preheat oven to 400F. Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, baking soda and Wonderslim until o biscuit dough-like consistency (add a little more Wonderslim, if needed). Add buttermilk, mixing together to complete the dough. Drop by large heaping spoonfuls, 2 inches apart on cookie sheet lightly coated with non-stick cooking spray. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Makes 18 biscuits. Per biscuit: 89 cal, &lt;1g fat, &lt;1g fiber For the sausage gravy: Using a blender, puree the flour with the Wonderslim. Add the broth and water to the blender and puree until smooth. Empty blender mixture into microwave safe bowl or stove top pan. Add the dry Beef(NOT!), seasoning salt and Liquid Smoke. Cook in microwave for 1 minute, stir and continue microwaving for 2 minutes or until hot. If you don't have a microwave, stir on your stove top until hot. Serve over biscuits or toast.

      <li>4 Medium-sized yams or sweet potatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter or margarine; (for greasing baking pan)</li>
      <li>1 cup Orange juice</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter; softened</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>These were originally posted by Virginia Sauer and are easy and wonderful. . Pour water into saucepan large enough to hold yams. Bring to a boil. . Boil yams until tender. . Discard water, peel yams, and cut them in half lengthwise. (THIS STEP CAN BE DONE UP TO A FULL DAY AHEAD OF TIME AND SET ASIDE UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO BAKE THE YAMS.) . Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. . Butter baking dish (approximately 12x8 inches). . Arrange yams, cut side down, in single layer in baking dish. (If necessary, overlapping is okay.) . Using a wire whisk, mix together remaining ingredients. (Since the butter will melt when the mixture bakes, do not worry about lumps of shortening.) THIS STEP CAN BE DONE EARLIER IN THE DAY, AND POURED OVER THE YAMS WHEN READY TO BAKE. . Pour orange juice mixture over the yams, trying to coat each yam. . Bake for 1 1/2 hours, basting approximately every 15 minutes. YIELD: 4 - 6 servings N. B. These reheat perfectly.

Or, replace fruit with dehydrated dates, apples, peaches, or cherries. Apple muesli is my favorite variation; for one serving: Soak 1 T rolled oats in 3 T water for 12 hrs (quick cooking oats, soaked 1/2 hr, can be substituted). In separate bowl, combine 1 T lemon juice with 3 T of the best organic yogurt available and sweeten with 1 T honey. Stir until mix is smooth and add pre-soaked oats. Next grate 1 unpeeled apple into bowl. Finally, sprinkle basic mix on top. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #052 by nance@utk.edu on Apr 9, 1997</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Clipping</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1 c sugar 1/2 c water 1/4 c light corn syrup 1/2 tsp salt 2 Tbsp vinegar 1 tsp vanilla or other flavoring such as orange or lemon, or use 1/2 tsp peppermint, or 1 oz bitter chocolate, grated. Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of the mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a candy thermometer. Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle flavoring over top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward the center until cool and firm enough to handle. Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and fingers are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to pull taffy. When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with both hands. Fold over and pull out again. As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will become stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand. Pull until it is difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm. Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors and roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store cooled taffy in an air tight container in a cool dry place. If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2 Tbsp corn syrup and 1/4 c water. Stir until dissolved and then recook according to original directions. Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added as the taffy is being pulled.

Put flour, gluten and salt in mixing bowl. Mix applesauce and warm water together and pour into flour mixture. Stir till all flour is absorbed into liquid. Knead for about 10 times. Let rest for 20 minutes. Divide into 12 pieces. Roll out each one to about an 8 inch circle. Brown each side in a preheated non-stick skillet. Heat should be set at medium low. Store in a ziplock bag or use immediately. If you want to use white flour, increase the amount by 1/2 cup and knead a little longer. FATFREE DIGEST V96 #123 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Prepare syrup: Combine 1 1/2 cups of the sugar with the water, honey, orange zest, stick cinnamon, lemon juice, and whole cloves in 2-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil. Lower flame and simmer, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Turn off flame under pot. Discard cinnamon stick, whole cloves, and orange zest. Stir in rosewater and vanilla extract. Set aside. Toast nuts: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Spread nuts in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Bake 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven and place on trivet. Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Make filling: Put 1 stick (8 tablespoons) of the butter in Dutch oven. Cook over low heat until melted. Turn off flame under pot. Stir in remaining 3/4 cup of the sugar, along with the ground spices. Mix until smooth. Stir in toasted nuts. Continue stirring until nuts are thoroughly coated with syrup. Set aside for filling. Clarify butter: Put remaining 5 sticks (1 1/4 pounds) butter into heavy 3-quart saucepan. Cook over low flame until butter has melted and a thin foam rises to the surface. Skim off this residue and reserve it for seasoning vegetables, et cetera. The remaining butter has been clarified. Assemble pastries: Using pastry brush, spread thin layer of clarified butter in bottom of 15x10x1/2-inch jelly roll pan. Set aside. Remove sheets of Phyllo from package. Gently unroll. Using scissors, cut through entire stack at once, dividing each sheet into quarters. Place Phyllo quarters between two sheets of plastic wrap, and cover with damp dish towel. (This is to prevent the dough from drying out.) Remove 1 square Phyllo from stack, making certain remainder stay covered. Brush entire surface (one side) with clarified butter. Place second square of Phyllo on top. Brush entire surface (one side) with clarified butter. continued in part 2</li>

      <li>1 Container; (8-ounce) (1 cup) half and half cream, room temperature</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Dry unseasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>These were originally posted by Virginia Sauer and are fantastic. _EVERYONE_ loves this. In addition to being delicious, it reheats perfectly, and is therefore ideal for covered dish, potluck, and buffet dinners. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread 1 tablespoon of the butter over bottom and sides of 1-quart casserole. Set aside. Pour carrots into 2-quart saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover carrots. Cook over high flame until water comes to a boil. Lower flame to moderate and continue cooking until carrots are barely tender when pierced with a fork (about 6 minutes). Drain carrots in colander. Set aside until cool enough to touch. Pour 1/3 of the drained carrots into the bottom of the greased casserole. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Pour half of the remaining carrots into a layer over the cheese. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Top with remaining carrots. Set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium-sized skillet. Add chopped onion. Saute over low flame until golden (about 3 minutes). Sprinkle with flour, salt, mustard, and pepper. Stir with wire whisk until mixture forms a paste. Gradually add cream (while continuing to stir constantly). Cook until thickened (consistency of a sauce). Pour over carrot-cheese mixture. Set aside. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in small pan. Add bread crumbs. Cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Sprinkle toasted bread crumbs evenly over contents of casserole. Place on center shelf of oven and bake 25 minutes. Serve hot.

      <li>2 cups Fat free pretzels; (up to 3)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fat free margarine melted with</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fat free Italian salad dressing</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Tiger Sauce or Hot Sauce; (Gives wonderful zip) Can eliminate (up to 4)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Soy sauce or to taste; (up to 4)</li>
      <li>Garlic powder to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix together the dry ingredients in large bowl. Melt together margarine, dressing on low heat (may look weird since it won't melt like normal fat containing margarine, but let it go a few minutes than use a whisk to mix it and it's fine). Add Tiger sauce, soy, and garlic powder. Stir and turn off heat allowing to cool for a few minutes. In the meantime, heat up your oven to 250 degrees and spray two cookie sheets lightly with a garlic or butter flavored spray (Spray is optional) Drizzle slowly (a little bit at a time) the liquid mixture over the dry mixture. Stir, drizzle some more, etc. I really take my time mixing so that I don't make anything soggy, and everything gets well coated. Spread in a single layer on baking sheets and bake 75 minutes. Every 20 minutes I open the oven, stir the mix a little and close it back up. Sometimes I reverse which oven racks the pans are on. When done, shut off the oven and open the door slightly. I leave the pans in the oven to cool and continue drying. Store in an airtight container. The cheerios remind me of peanuts--hard and crunchy (They shrink).

      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried rosemary or thyme, tied in cheesecloth</li>
      <li>6 1/2 ounces Tuna fish, (up to 7) packed in oil</li>
      <li>2 ounces Flat anchovy fillets, packed in olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Nonpareil capers, (up to 4)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Grated lemon zest</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice, (up to 4)</li>
      <li>1 cup Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the veal in a casserole large enough to accomodate it. Add the wine and enough water to cover the veal by 1/2 an inch. Remove veal and set aside. Add vegetables and bouquet garni to the water and bring the liquid to a boil. Return the meat to the simmering water, cover and cook gently for about 1 1/2 hours or until the veal is cooked through. Remove the veal from the heat and let it cool in its own liquid, remove it from the liquid and the veal is ready. (Boil the remaining liquid down by half and use as you would broth.) Remove strings and thinly slice. In a food processor puree until creamy the tuna fish, anchovies, capers, vegetable and olive oils. Add lemon zest and 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice (add more if you wish). Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and fold in the mayonnaise and season very well with salt and pepper. Spread bottom of a shallow nonmetal dish with a layer of tuna sauce. Arrange some veal slices, in a single layer, end to end, over the tuna sauce. Cover first layer of veal again with tuna sauce. Build up a second layer of veal and cover with sauce again. End with a generous layer of sauce, (making sure veal is entirely covered so that it does not dry out). Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 24 hours. Serve chilled with steamed haricot verts (French green beans) or asparagus along with wedges of ripe tomato, halved pitted black olives, snipped chives and chopped parsley.

Now, go down to your handy market and get some rolls, say Kaiser rolls (plain) or maybe plain french rolls. Take your freshly made Q'd and pulled pork and pile it on the botton half of the roll, then pour several, 3-4 tablespoons to taste, of the vinegar sauce and top with the slaw, maybe nearly as much as the pork. There is something about the vinegar/slaw-mayo/smoked pork that is unique and wonderfully good. bbq-digest V2 #066 From the BBQ recipe list.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe is adapted from Stalking The Healthful Herbs by Euell Gibbons. If you are interested in additional violet recipes, look for this book which contains six more. Make an infusion with violets and water by placing your blossoms in a glass jar and covering them with boiling water. Put a lid on the jar, and set aside for 24 hours. The infusion will turn a murky bluish green. Strain and discard the violets. Add the lemon juice to the violet infusion, and it transforms to a clear lavender pink. Stir in powdered pectin, and bring to a boil. Add 4 cups sugar, bring to a boil again, and boil vigorously for one minute. Skim if necessary. Pour into sterile jars and seal. Makes approximately 2 1/2 cups jelly. Posted to recipelu-digest by molony &lt;molony@scsn.net&gt; on Feb 27, 1998</li>

      <li>From: Maggie &lt;MWORKMAN@VM.CC.PURDUE.EDU&gt; Date: Fri, 23 Jul 93 13:39:23 EST Taken (without permission) from The Complete Book of Breads. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir the cornmeal gradually into the rapidly boiling water. When the mixture is smooth, add butter, salt and stir in the milk. Remove from heat and stir in the egg yolks. Allow the mixture to cool to warm (90-100 degrees). Meanwhile, beat the egg whites to hold a peak. Fold into the mixture. Pour batter into the baking dish (one 1-quart baking dish, greased or buttered). It should come to no more than 3/4 way up the sides. Level with rubber spatula. Bake in the oven until it is puffed and nicely browned. A knife blade slipped into the bread will come out clean when it is done. Remove bread from the oven. Serve immediately, and with a spoon.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Spoon bread is simply a very rich and dense corn bread, a dish so dense that it must be served up with a spoon. General Washington loved this dish and it was apparently served quite often at Mount Vernon. Mix the cornmeal and salt together and stir them into the hot milk. Cook over very low heat, stirring all the time, until thick and smooth. Continue cooking for 15 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly. Stir in the baking powder and well-beaten yolks, and fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Turn into a greased casserole or 8-inch-square pan. Bake in a moderate oven (375ø) about 35 minutes, or until the bread is firm and the crust is brown. Serve from the baking dish. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>Beat sugar and yolks together until pale and thick. Add violet essence and candied violets. Whip egg whites with salt to stiff peaks. Fold together. Butter the inside of a large souffle dish and coat with as much sugar as will stick to the butter. Pour souffle mixture in. Bake 15 minutes at 400. Sprinkle confectioner's sugar over the top and return to oven for 5 more minutes. Serve hot. You may substitute 1/3 c of liquor (rum or bourbon, for example) or up to 1/2 c of liqueur (orange or apricot brandy or Grand Marnier, for example) for the violet essence and candied violets. In most of these cases you might want to add 1/2 t or so of vanilla as well.

      <li>optional, depending on how strict you want to be about the vlf: 6 drops or so of toasted sesame oil (doesn't add dramatically to the fat, but *greatly* improves the flavor for us "real" hummus fans - makes up partially for the lack of tahini) Combine all ingredients in blender and blend smooth. Garnish with a dash of paprika and serve w/pita triangles, in a sandwich, etc. My favorite is hummus on a pita with carrots, cucumbers, and lettuce (that was lunch today, in fact!)

    <title>Vivi's Flourless Chocolate Cake</title>
    <category>Cakes</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar,</li>
      <li>400 grams Bittersweet chocolate,</li>
      <li>6 Egg whites</li>
      <li>Liqueur (optional).</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Beat egg yolks with the sugar until thick and pale and mixture forms a ribbon, as for making a sponge. Melt the chocolate over hot water and allow to cool slightly. Fold chocolate very gently into the egg yolk mixture, careful not to deflate it too much. Add a Tbls. or two of your favourite liqueur if you wish at this point. Whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the chocolate mixture. Pour into a greased and lined 23cm (9 1/2 inch) cake tin or a heart shaped tin or other shaped mould...try to keep it simple though as this is a moist cake. Bake in a bain marie in the oven at 140C/250F for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until done when tested with a toothpick...it will not test completely dry though. Leave to relax with the oven door ajar for another hour. The cake will rise like a souffle but will settle as there is no flour. Turn out when cold and dust with icing (confectioner's) sugar if desired. Serve with fresh unsweetened heavy cream, berries and a chocolate sauce or icecream. NB: For this cake to turn out well, use a good German, Belgian or Swiss bittersweet chocolate (preferably one with at least 60% cocoa solids). Also, I have not given an exact amount of sugar in this recipe...it depends on the type of chocolate you use (less sugar if you use semisweet chocolate for example) and how sweet you like the cake to be. I don't usually measure the sugar but I don't use much as it is much nicer if the flavour is intensely chocolate and not overly sweet.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Someone asked a while back about a recipe on a lasagne box that called for uncooked noodles. I have copied this recipe off the Skinner Lasagne box. It is the only lasagne recipe I use. It is very easy and you can of course substitute homemade sauce if you like. I had always heard people say how hard it is to make lasagne. I never knew what the fuss was until I read some other recipes. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In 3-quart saucepan, brown meat; drain. Add spaghetti sauce and water; simmer about 10 minutes. In bowl, stir together ricotta, one-half mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, salt and pepper. Pour about 1 cup sauce on bottom of 13x9-inch baking dish. Arrange 3 UNCOOKED pasta pieces lengthwise over sauce; cover with about 1 cup sauce. Spread one-half cheese filling over sauce. Repeat layers of lasagne, sauce and cheese filling. Top with layer of lasagne and remaining sauce; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil; bake additional 15 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting. 10 to 12 servings. Alternate Method: Recipe can be prepared with COOKED lasagne noodles following same instructions.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: FRITZ@QHORSE.STX.COM Date: Tue, 16 Jul 1996 8:12:45 -0400 (EDT) Saute the shrimp (or scallops) with garlic in 1 or 2 tsp of olive oil until they loose their transparency (about 4-5 minutes max). Add tomatos and basil, and simmer 5 more minutes. Serve over rice or pasta, with a sprinkle of good fresh or shredded parmesan (the powdered stuff doesn't seem to do it). *Use scallops if cholesterol is a major concern-they are lower than shrimp in fat and cholesterol.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: viv@tauon.ph.unimelb.edu.au (Viviane Buzzi) Date: 25 Sep 1995 11:14:38 -0500 Source: "Focaccia" by Carol Field, (Chronicle Books, SF) ISBN: 0-8118-0854-8 (hc), 0-8118-0604-9 (pb) Serves: 8 to 10; Makes one 10 inch focaccia This focaccia is known as "sfoglierata". It is fantastic eaten warm although it keeps for 2 days wrapped in a plastic bag. You can gently reheat slices ... it's better than eating it cold, although it is OK cold too. Whisk the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl; let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the room-temperature water and the oil. If you are making the dough by hand, combine the flour and the salt, add them in 2 additions, and mix until the dough comes together well. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 4 to 5 minutes, let the dough rest briefly, and finish kneading for another minute or two. The dough will be soft and as delicate as an ear lobe. If you are using a heavy-duty electric mixer, use the paddle attachment to mix the flour and salt into the yeast mixture until they form a dough. Change to the dough hook and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the dough is as tender as an ear lobe. FIRST RISE: Place the dough in a lightly oiled container, cover it tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. SHAPING AND SECOND RISE: Turn the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and roll it with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12 x 18 inch rectangle that is about 1/4 inch thick. The dough will roll out easily and repair easily, if it should tear. To fill, paint the 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the top of the dough - be sure to brush it thoroughly, even liberally - and then cover the surface with a thick carpet of basil leaves. Roll up the dough from the long end, like a jelly roll. Oil a 10 x 4 inch angel-food tube pan very well and slip the dough into it, seam side down. Don't be concerned if the 2 ends of the roll don't touch; they will after the second rise. Cover the dough with a towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Baking: At least 30 minutes before you plan to bake, preheat the oven to 200C/400F with a baking stone inside, if you have one. Brush the top of the "sfoglierata" with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Place the pan directly on the stone and bake until golden, about 40 minutes. Let cool for 15 or 20 minutes, then slide the blade of a long thin knife or spatula between the "sfoglierata" and the pan sides and the center tube to loosen it. Place on a rack. Serve warm. VIVIANE'S NOTES: When you cannot get your hands on fresh basil leaves, you can use pesto as a filling ... just make sure that the filling is not too liquid or it will create a mess as you roll up the focaccia. It is delicious with pesto inside. I use pesto without the cheese added. I think a filling of olive pesto/pate or artichoke pate would be good too.

    <category>Sauces</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Bright green aromatic basil; tightly packed</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 White garlice cloves; peeled</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Pine nuts; coarsely crushed</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Freshly grated imported parm</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Freshly grated imported peco romano cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Panini, Crostini, Brushetta Place basil, olive oil, garlic, pine nuts, and salt to taste in a blender. Process until finely textured but not completely smooth. Scrape pesto into a bowl and sir inthe cheeses. If not using immediately, pour a thin layer of extra-irgin olie oil over the top. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until needed. Makes about 1 cup. Fresh basil pesto led the revolution in authentic Italian cooking in America. It wasn't red and it didn't cook for hours on the stove. In fact, it was green! And you didn't have to cook it at all! The fragrant green leaves, crushed with garlic and pine nuts, when tossed with freshly cooked pasta, creates a dish of unforgettale aroma and taste. Aromatic pesto can be used as a spread for panini with equally memorable effect. The following recipe produces a dense mixture specifically for panini; to use with pasta, just add a little more olive oil and thin with some hot pasta cooking water.

      <li>Date: Thu, 02 May 1996 21:14:00 -0400 From: Walt Gray &lt;waltgray@mnsinc.com&gt; Wash one large beef tongue or several lamb tongues well. Place the tongue in a kettle and cover with cold water. Add 2 whole buttons of garlic and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the water to a boil and turn the heat down. Cover the kettle with a lid and keep the water boiling until the tongue is tender to fork. This can take three or more hours. When the tongue is tender, run cold water over it and skin it. Be sure to trim the membranes under the tongue. Next slice the tongue to about 1/4 inch slices. (The tongue can be fixed a day or two ahead and then wrapped in saran wrap and refrigerated. Saute the garlic, onion and green pepper until golden brown. Add tomato sauce, pimento and sugar. Simmer slowly for 15 minutes. Add the tongue and continue simmering until the tongue is good and hot. This dish is good hot or cold. The sauce can also be used for tripe, pigs feet or any left over meat.

      <li>Full Load Serves 4 - 6 -- Half Load (2-4): *NOTE: A Popeil measuring cup **NOTE: Or equivalent to 2 eggs, beaten Note: The Full Load recipe calls for 1 T olive oil. The half load recipe calls for 1 T olive oil. I omit the oil completely. Because I eliminate the oil I do heat the dye before I extrude. What I do is to heat up about 34/ C water in a 1 C measurement in the microwave..NOT TO BOILING THOUGH. Then when the water is warm enough I remove it from the microwave and lower the dye into it. DON'T DROP the dye ....lower it carefully to avoid splashes and nasty burns. I usually let it sit in the hot water for about 1 - 1/2 minutes and the put it on the machine and start extruding immediately. Equivalents: One Popeil Measuring Cup is equivalent to 1 2/3 C standard measurement. Use the mix and then extrude in any shape that you prefer. We made this into fettucine. This was very good!!

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 packages ACTIVE DRY YEAST (2 TBS--recipe says)</li>
      <li>4 cups WARM WATER (120- to 130^)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups WARM WATER (105- to 110^)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons SALT (I used salt substitute)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups SUGAR</li>
      <li>9 To 11 cups BREAD FLOUR, divided</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup water (105- to 110^). To the 4 cups of water (120- to 130^) in a LARGE mixing bowl, add salt, sugar, and 4 cups of flour. Add yeast mixture and mix well. Add enough flour to make a workable dough. Knead well--takes a loooong time and I don't think you can make it using, either a Kitchenaid or ABM, you have to do it by hand, give yourself PLENTY of counter space. &lt;g&gt; I kneaded the dough for about 15 minutes--took that long to get the flour to absorb. Place dough into a LARGE, greased bowl (I used my large Tupperware cake-taker--this is a LOT of dough) and turn to coat top. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise until double. The recipe didn't give a time--mine took about 1 hour, maybe less, I nearly forgot about it. &lt;g&gt; Punch down, knead lightly and form into a round loaf. Place in a 4-1/2 quart Dutch oven. The recipe says to cover with plastic wrap but I knew that if I did that, the loaf might deflate. I lightly sprayed a piece of waxed paper with Pam and covered it with that--came off nicely without deflating the loaf. Let rise again until double. Mine took about 25 minutes and it was trying to climb out of the Dutch oven. Preheat the oven to 425^ about 15 minutes before the dough is ready. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 350^ and bake for an additional 50-60 minutes. My loaf was getting too brown so I covered it with foil when I reduced the oven temperature. I also decided to reduce the heat to 325^ and only baked it for about 45 minutes-- it was done. NOTE: Next time, if there is one, I plan on cutting the recipe in half--it's REALLY BIG. I expected it to be BIG, but 9-1/2" high and 10" wide? That's how big this loaf is--never seen anything like it before. Half the recipe, cooked in the same size Dutch oven would make a nice size and shaped loaf. Making the entire recipe, it would make a GREAT bowl for any dip and the bread could be used for dipping. Oh, have fun trying to find something to store it in--I ended up using a medium-size (new) trash can liner and it filled it up. It's light and airy inside (like a French bread) and the crust nice and chewy--I opted to brush the loaf with water once I took it from the oven and it never got really soft--stayed chewy.

    <title>Basmati and Wild Rice Salad with Tangerines And Pine Nuts</title>
    <category>Rice</category>
    <category>Vegetarian</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Wild rice</li>
      <li>7 cups Water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Basmati rice; rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Tangerine juice; about 4 tangerines</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dried currants</li>
      <li>3 Tangerines</li>
      <li>Champagne wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Light olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Pine nuts; toasted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the wild rice in a large saucepan; cover with 1 quart water, add 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil; cover and cook until the grains are tender but still chewy, about 30 to 35 minutes. Bring the remaining 3 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan; add the basmati rice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until just tender. Drain and cool, then add to the wild rice. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the tangerine juice just to boiling; pour over the currants to plump them. Peel and section the tangerines, removing the seeds and threads. Toss the rice with the currants, tangerine juice, 1/2 tablespoon Champagne vinegar, and the olive oil. If necessary, adjust the seasoning with salt and a splash of vinegar. Add the tangerines and the toasted pine nuts just before serving at room temperature. VARIATION: Use oranges and their juice in place of tangerines. Using a sharp knife, remove the peel and white pith from the orange by slicing off the top and bottom, then working down the sides. Hold the orange over a bowl to catch the juice and cut each section loose by slicing down next to the membrane.</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Basmati rice (from Indian grocery or gourmet shop)</li>
      <li>1 small Onion</li>
      <li>3 medium Carrots</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>2 Cloves</li>
      <li>4 Black peppercorns</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Light vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kosher salt (or to taste)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash the rice in cool water, squeezing gently with your fingers, until the water runs clear. Put the rice in about 2 cups of cool water to soak for 20 minutes. Strain soak water into saucepan and heat. Leave rice to dry in strainer. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. While rice is drying, chop onion finely and set aside. Dice carrots and set aside. Measure spices. When rice is dry, heat oil over medium-high flame in heavy, oven-proof skillet or casserole dish. Add spices. When spices become fragrant, add butter and onions. Cook until onions are tender and light golden brown. Add carrots and cook for 3-5 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring very gently for 5 minutes. Add salt and heated soak water, bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until water on top of rice has boiled off. Cover tightly and cook for 20 minutes at 350 degrees F. Remove from oven, let rest for 10 minutes, then serve. NOTES: * Basmati Rice with Carrots -- This is a delicate, fragrant rice dish, one of our favorites. I got the recipe from an Indian cooking class. It's a bit of work, but well worth it. * It is important to handle the rice gently so that the grains are not broken. It's also important to use whole spices; ground spices would overpower the rice. * This dish can be re-heated in the oven. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling. : Precision: measure the ingredients. : Nancy Mintz : AT&amp;T-Information Systems, UNIX System Development Lab, Summit, NJ : ihnp4!attunix!nlm : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust Date: Wed, 12 Jun 1996 22:11:02 -0700 From: Julie Bertholf &lt;jewel1@ix.netcom.com&gt; MM-Recipes Digest V3 #164 From the MealMaster recipe list.

      <li>CIBO Cheese is a goat cheese mixed with cream and other flavorings. I bought it at an upscale grocery store, in the deli section. Make the crust: Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Process flour, salt and butter just until combined and crumbly in texture. Add water, 2 tablespoons at a time. Do not overprocess. Press evenly into pan, up 1 1/2 inches at the side. Allow to chill while making the filling. Make the filling: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine CIBO goat cheese, ricotta, butter, eggs (adding one at a time, processing well after each addition), flour, salt and pepper. Pour filling into shell, bake until puffed and brown for 25-30 minutes.

      <li>Puree the basil with 1/2 cup of olive oil. Cover with a bit of olive oil and refrigerate for up to two weeks if desired. (The length of time the basil is in oil helps to diffuse the flavor into the oil. On the other hand, after two weeks, the fresh basil begins to lose its bouquet, and taste to natural spoilage.

      <li>To make these good smelling bath salts, first measure 1/2 cup of Epsom salt into each jar with a lid. Add 15 drops of food color to each jar, one color per jar and put on the lids. Shake the jars until the Epsom salts are dyed evenly. If you want your colors to be darker, add more food color and shake again. Take off the lids and let the salts dry overnight. Now, make sure your pretty jar is all clean and dry. Then pour the dyed bath salts into the jar, alternating colors (you may want to get colors that go together well). Add a couple of drops of perfume to the bath salts, put on the lid and tie the jar with your pretty ribbon. Now you have a really nice present to bless someone with. busted by sooz Recipe by: Key Gourmet Posted to recipelu-digest by sooz &lt;kirkland@gj.net&gt; on Mar 20, 1998</li>

(If the soup is too thick, add a little of the reserved canned tomato liquid.) Season with salt and pepper. If using shrimp, cook in a large saucpen of boiling salted water until they just turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and let cool. Peel shrimp and cut in half lengthwise. Ladle into warmed soup bowls and garnish with shrimp, if using, and chives (or basil). Serve immediately.

      <li>1 ounce Pepper sauce; (La red hot)</li>
      <li>3 ounces Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 ounces Garlic juice</li>
      <li>1 1/2 ounces Onion juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Meat tenderizer</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix all ingredients in sauce pan and bring to a boil, let simmer for at least 15 minutes, remove from heat and let cool. This sauce may be used on meat, poultry, or wild game. You may adjust above seasoning to taste by adding different spices or varying amounts. Any left over sauce may be stored for several weeks in the refrigerator. Some cooks substitute other liquids instead of water. Some of the liquids substituted for water are beer, Coke, Dr Pepper, and fruit juice(apple, pineapple, cranberry, etc.) . * Some people find the 1/2 cup of salt in the above recipe is too much for their taste. * When seasoning fowl, puncture skin as few times as possible. * When seasoning large cuts of meat always inject from the top so the sauce won't leak out. If you feel it necessary to inject from the side, always angle needle downward. Posted to recipelu-digest by molony &lt;molony@scsn.net&gt; on Feb 18, 1998</li>

      <li>Powdered sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Poach chicken in water to cover with 1 - 2 teaspoons each of cinnamon, ground ginger and cumin. Add saffron or turmeric, if you don't use saffron. Meanwhile, toast almonds, chop and mix with sugar and 1 Tablespoon cinnamon. Set aside. Remove chicken, shred when cool enough to handle. Reduce broth severely and add lemon juice. Beat eggs until frothy and add to broth. Cook until broth evaporates and eggs look scrambled. The eggs should not be wet. Remove from heat. Have the chicken, almonds and eggs ready before you pull out the phyllo. (Follow package directions for thawing and handling phyllo, as it dries out easily.) Use a cast iron skillet (10 - 12 inch) or round, heavy casserole to bake the Bastilla. Using pastry brush, butter pan. Place 6 phyllo sheets in pan overlapping all around, buttering each as you go. Fold an additional 2 sheets to place in the bottom as support. Spread almond mixture evenly over bottom of pan. Layer 1/2 the eggs, all the chicken, and the remaining eggs. Fold 2 sheets of phyllo dough and place over top. Fold in the overhang from the original 6 sheets. Additional butter may be needed to ensure that the phyllo sticks together. Bake at 425 degrees for 20 - 30 minutes, until phyllo is brown and crisp. Invert onto serving plate, sprinkle top with powdered sugar. Bastilla is traditionally eaten with the fingers as an appetizer. The serving size mentioned above is for main dish meal. The filling can be very hot and it is also traditional to make holes in the top to release steam and cool the Bastilla. NOTES : * Pigeon/squab is more authentic, you may try Cornish game hens for a little more flavor. Recipe by: Internet Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #777 by LBotsko@aol.com on Sep 9, 1997</li>

      <li>( preserved goose in it's own fat ) Cut up goose, cutting thighs and back into two parts, and breast into four. Remove wing tips and set aside.( Save for stock or soup ) Put fat (goose and pork) into large Dutch oven with 1/2 cup water and cook on low heat until all fat has rendered.Discard scraps. Mix together salt, herbs, and spices (excluding garlic).Rub goose pieces with salt mixture, using entire amount. Put pieces in heavy plastic bag, close tightly, and refrigerate for 2 days, turning bag often. Remelt fat. Wipe goose pieces dry and put them in the melted fat in Dutch oven.Add garlic and weight meat down with heavy plate.Put Dutch oven on very low heat and cook very slowly for 1 1/2 hours. Pour 1 inch of cooking fat into the bottom of a clean dry crock and allow fat to harden.Pack partly cooled pieces of goose into crock and then strain cooking fat over pieces. A thick layer of fat should cover the pieces of goose and there should be no air spaces between meat pieces.Cover tightly and refrigerate.Keeps up to 1 year. A pice of confit ( with a little of the fat) is good added to a stew or casserole as a flavor booster. It is also good served, in small portions, warmed over low heat, and poured over mashed potatoes or rice. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest by BobbieB1 &lt;BobbieB1@aol.com&gt; on Apr 27, 1998</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>You may substitute pork shoulder or beef chuck for the lamb. Use beef stock for beef, chicken stock for pork or lamb. Basic stew: Trim meat of fat and cut into 1-1/2" chunks. Bring all ingredients to boil in 4-qt pot, cover tightly, reduce heat, and simmer 2-1/2 hours, until meat is tender. Crockpot directions: pile all ingredients into crockpot and cook all day on LOW. When done: skim off and discard fat. It takes less than 8 minutes to assemble this stew. Then you can pay it little or no attention as it simmers for about 2-1/2 hours. Make multiples of the basic stew, then divide stew into 4-serving portions; refrigerate or in airtight containers for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in microwave-safe container on defrost or in refrigerator for 24 hours. To assemble: bring basic stew, vegetables, and spices to boil in 3-qt pot. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, stirring twice, until vegetables are almost tender. Whisk chicken stock with flour until blended. Stir into stew and simmer, uncovered, 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until gravy is slightly thickened and vegetables are tender. This stew is also good made with beef or pork.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Soak dried mushrooms in 2 cups hot water for 30 minutes. Drain and strain out sand, reserving liquid and mushrooms separately. 2. Put rice, saffron or saffron flowers, mushroom liquor, and water in rice cooker and set to cook and keep. 3. Dry-roast all remaining spices and herbs. Add sauteing liquid with onion and celery and saute for a few minutes. Add carrots. Add mushrooms and green pepper, each time sauteing for several minutes (add more liquid if necessary). Add tomatoes and beans. 4. Simmer 10 minutes, uncovered, allowing some of the liquid to evaporate. 5. Serve over or mixed with rice. NOTES : 1. I used 1 tsp olive oil to saute in, and no additional liquid. 2. For mushroom broth, I had previously soaked mushrooms for another recipe and not used them. I had also roasted some garlic. I added the skins from the roasted garlic to the saved mushroom broth and simmered them together, making a delicious and very aromatic vegetable broth. This is what I used to cook the rice in. 3. I'm sure any kind of dried mushrooms will do. I just used what I happened to have on hand. Likewise for the beans; I had originally thought of using black beans, but didn't happen to have any. 4. It sounds like a lot of ingredients, but it didn't take long to make. Dry-roasting the spices is a critical step, as it brings out their flavor.

    <title>Baked Beans #06</title>
    <category>Vegetable</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Small white beans; sorted, soaked</li>
      <li>1 pound Bacon - trimmed and cut into small bits (up to)</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Light brown sugar (up to)</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Katsup</li>
      <li>Dry mustard</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Either soak beans overnight in 8-10 times as much water or boild for one minute in above amount of water and let sit for an hour rinse, rinse and rinse again - this is the best way I've found for making them socially acceptable in small rooms. Cut and trim bacon. I use scissors to cut a few slices at a time into 1/2" pieces. You can generally pull excess fat off the small pieces easily. In a 3 qt/liter corning ware covered dish (this works very well and cleans well also) lay a layer of beans (about 1/5), squirt ketchup over the beans, sprinkle with brown sugar and (lightly) sprinkle dry mustard and pepper over all. Drop layer of bacon on top. Repeat until everything is used up. Add enough fresh water to cover everything by 1/8 inch, cover dish, and set in 300 deg. oven. Two hours later, check the water level. One hour later, do the same. Check every hour or so, until about 5-6 hours have passed. By then they should be done.

Lightly oil an 8-inch square baking pan. 2. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, saute onion and garlic in sherry until soft but not browned. Lightly beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Spoon into a bowl and mix with whole egg, bread crumbs, parsley, dill, cayenne, cheeses, and artichokes. Add sauteed onion and garlic. Pour into oiled baking pan. 3. Bake until set (about 30 minutes). Let cool, then cut into about 25 squares. Serve warm or cold. NOTES : Guests will devour these rich-tasting, melt-in-your-mouth pastries, so make plenty. Use marinated artichokes for the best flavor, and low-fat cheeses for the best nutritional value. This recipe can be made up to three weeks ahead of time and frozen until ready to bake and serve.

      <li>Source: Vergie Ewing Fry hamburger and chopped onion together; drain and put mixture in an ungreased 9x13 inch baking pan. In a separate bowl, put the frozen mixed vegetables, garlic powder, cream of chicken soup and 1 cup of the milk. Mix well and pour over the hamburger-onion mixture. Mix together the Bisquick and remaining 1 1/2 cup of milk (will be thin). Pour over the mixture in the pan. Bake at 450 degrees until crust is golden brown. (It took about 40 minutes for me, but ovens vary). You could use diced chicken, turkey, or ham, or tuna instead of the ground beef.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Artichoke hearts are good with a sprinkling of olive oil, dried basil to taste crumbled over, salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, and a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar -- all micro-waved for about 2 minutes (just to marry the flavours) or heated in a regular oven for maybe 8 minutes at about 325F. This is good for antipasto or appetizers, great with chunks of feta and chopped sun-dried tomatoes.

I took: Imagineering!, Radio Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou. Romantic Dinners: Romantic Dinners allows you and your partner (if you bring one) to learn what makes an evening romantic and how to prepare a delicious and easy meal together. You are not obligated to bring a partner so don't worry. With our appetizer and salad course, we were served champagne. With dinner, a wonderful white wine was selected. Dessert... you'll see. Preheat oven to 350 degree F. Cut Brie half into four triangles. Stick together two pieces to form a rectangle. Brush olive oil on phyllo sheets. Place the Brie on the phyllo and roll up, tucking ends. Brush olive oil on all exposed surfaces of phyllo. Place on parchment paper and cook for 5-10 minutes or until golden brown.

    <title>Baked Brie En Croute with Tomato Chutney</title>
    <category>Appetizers</category>
    <category>Cheese</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Package frozen puff pastry sheets; thawed</li>
      <li>17 1/4 ounces Wheel brie; chilled</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Tomato chutney; see recipe follows</li>
      <li>1 large Egg; lightly beaten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. On a lightly floured surface roll out 1 sheet of pastry 1/8-inch thick (about 15 inches in diameter) and, using Brie as a guide, cut out 1 round the size of the Brie. 2. With a 2 3/4-inch star shaped cutter cut out 5 stars from trimmings. Reserve pastry round and stars. 3. Halve Brie horizontally. Roll out remaining sheet of pastry 1/8-inch thick (about 15 inches in diameter) and transfer to a shallow baking pan, about 15 1/2 by 10 1/2 inches. 4. Center bottom half of Brie, cut side up, on pastry in pan and spread 1/2 cup tomato chutney to within 1/2 inch of Brie edge. 5. Top chutney with remaining half of Brie, cut side down. 6. Without stretching pastry, wrap up over Brie and trim excess to leave a 1-inch border on top of Brie. 7. Brush border with some egg and top with reserved pastry round, pressing edges of dough together gently but firmly to seal. 8. Brush top of pastry with some remaining egg and arrange reserved stars decoratively on it. Lightly brush stars with some remaining egg, being careful not to let egg drip over edges of stars, which would prevent them from rising. 9. With the back of a table knife gently score side of pastry with vertical marks, being careful not to piece dough. Chill Brie, uncovered, 30 minutes to set egg wash. Brie may be made to this point 1 day ahead and kept chilled, covered loosely. 10. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bake Brie in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Let Brie stand in pan on a rack about 20 minutes for very runny melted cheese, about 40 minutes for thicker melted cheese, and serve with remaining tomato chutney.

    <quantity>20</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Stephen Ceideburg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Grated ginger</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Peanut or corn oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>3 cups Cantonese barbecue pork, in 1/2-inch dice (about 1-lb.)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>Chinese Baked Sweet Bread Dough (recipe follows)</li>
      <li>1 package Active dry yeast (1 tablespoon)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Warm milk (100 to 110)</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups All-purpose flour, + more for dusting and kneading</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Reheat in a 350 degree F. oven for 5 minutes, or microwave at high about 1 minute. Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and water in a bowl. Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion; stir-fry until soft. Don't brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds. Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15 seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10 pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each circle 1/8-inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker. If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it. Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb. Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat egg yolks with water and sugar; brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes. Makes 20 buns. CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked to the Western eye. Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4 cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk. Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a lightly floured board. Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves. Makes enough for 20 barbecued pork buns. Joyce Jue, San Francisco Chronicle, 1/8/92 Posted by Stephen Ceideburg</li>

    <title>Baked Brie with Cranberry Chutney</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 cups Fresh cranberries; (which have been washed and picked over)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Firmly-packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Currants OR small; seedless raisins</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Dry mustard</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground allspice</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground cardamom</li>
      <li>2 packages Crescent Rolls</li>
      <li>1 4"-round Brie</li>
      <li>1 Egg; beaten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine first 4 ingredients AND all the spices in a saucepan. Cook until cranberries pop, then cool completely. Open each can of Crescents. Divide each rectangle into 2 sections (each section will have 4 triangles) - press perforations together. Place one section on top of another section - YOU NOW HAVE TWO PIGGY-BACKED SECTIONS. Roll each section of two with a rolling pin into about 6"-squares. Place each square in a small (about 8") torte tin. Cut the Brie in half. Remove the crust. Plop on a generous amount of chutney. Pull the pastry up and gather at the top (so it looks like a pretty little bag that has been tied at the neck, kinda...sorta). Brush eachone with egg. Bake in preheated 350° oven for about 20 minutes, or until bubbly and pastry is browned. Now - if you want to do without making the chutney, you just prepare the Crescent rolls as described, put in a nice chunk of decrusted Brie by itself, and proceed.

Top with caramelized onions. Cover with other half of Brie, cut side down. 4. Draw pastry up around brie, holding corners. Tuck edges in and twist corners together to form bundle. 5. Beat egg yolk with 1 tsp water and brush on pastry, avoiding edges. 6. Bake at 425o for 20 minutes or until golden and puffed. Let Brie stand in pan on rack for 20 minutes for runny cheese or 40 minutes for thicker cheese. EAT-L Digest 16 July 96 From the EAT-L recipe list.

I always hope to have leftovers and I end up eating it for lunch (or even dinner) the next day. It comes from the Mr. Food Cookbook - OH, It's So Good - Cut a hole in the top of the bread loaf about 5 inches in diameter. Remove soft bread from cut portion and discard. Reserve crust to make top for loaf. Scoop out most of the soft inside portion of the loaf and save for other purposes, such as stuffing or dried bread crumbs. In the butter, saute the green onions and the garlic until the onions wilt. Cut the cream cheese into small chunks, add the onions, garlic, sour cream and cheddar cheese. Mix well. Fold in artrichoke hearts, Out all of this mixture into hollowed out bread. Place top on bread and wrap in a couble thickness of heavy duty aluminum foil. Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. When ready, remove foil and serve, using cocktail rye bread to dip out the sauce. Posted to KitMailbox Digest by J Pellegrino &lt;gigimfg@ix.netcom.com&gt; on Jun 05, 1998</li>

      <li>1 Whole head garlic</li>
      <li>1 Sprig fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 Round; (12-ounce) of brie cheese</li>

      <li>Ingredient Group: GARNISH</li>
      <li>Sprigs of fresh basil or rosemary</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Notes: From Orange County Registar Cook's note: If you can only find small, 4-ounce disks of brie, push 3 small wheels next to one another. Advance preparation: Garlic can be roasted several days in advance and stored, airtight, in the refrigerator. You can assemble the brie with the garlic, tomatoes and pine nuts a day in advance and store, airtight, in the refrigerator. Preliminaries: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 1. Cut off 1/4 inch of pointed end of head of garlic (save small pieces for another recipe). Place cut side up in a piece of aluminum foil. Place rosemary on top. Bring sides of foil up to make a deep bowl, but do not enclose garlic completely. Pour olive oil over top of garlic. Bake for 40-45 minutes in preheated oven. Cool. 2. Squeeze garlic so that the cloves pop out of their papery jackets. They should be creamy. Smash them and spread on top of brie (including some of the rosemary). Place brie in ovenproof dish. Top with tomatoes and pine nuts. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees. 3. Bake brie until warm and softened, about 13-18 minutes. If topping is getting too browned, cover loosely with aluminum foil during last portion of baking. 4. Sprinkle slivers of fresh basil on top. Surround with crostini and/or apple slices. Garnish with sprigs of fresh herbs and, if using, drained imported olives. Provide a spreading knife.

      <li>From: bfrumker@cmnh.org (Bruce Frumker) Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 12:17:49 -0400 Walter Jetton was BBQ caterer to the LBJ Ranch. In 1965, he (along with Arthur Whitman) published "Walter Jetton's LBJ Barbecue Cook Book." I have mentioned it a couple of times in posts, and, since the book is long out of print, I got several requests to post some of the recipes. Here are some of my favorites, along with Jetton's comments and instructions... The easiest way to get yourself a good baked bean dish is to buy yourself some canned baked beans and then procede as follows. Mix all the ingredients in a skillet and cook on the grill about 15 minutes so the flavors can blend. Some canned tomatoes on top will pep up the color and add to the flavor. bbq-digest V2 #058 From the BBQ recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

Meanwhile, melt 2 T. butter in a saucepan and add flour; cook for a minute or two. Stir in bouillon (made from cubes, or use canned for less salt) and wine. Cook and stir until thickened and smooth. Add parsley. Add mushrooms, if desired. Pour sauce over chicken; cover pan tightly. Bake 10-15 minutes longer, until chicken is done. Makes 4 servings, and goes well with wild rice or a rice pilaf.

      <li>1 cup Packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Dry mustard</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Instant minced onion</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served without freezing. Add beans to boiling water; return to boiling. Boil beans 2 minutes; then soak beans 1 hour (or overnight, if preferred). Add salt pork and salt to beans. Cook beans slowly until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Drain; save 2 cups cooking liquid. Mix bean cooking liquid, molasses, brown sugar, mustard, and onion. Pour over beans. Mix gently. Pour one-fourth of mixture into each baking dish. TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING: Preheat oven to 350ø F. (moderate). Bake 1 hour or until beans are lightly browned and sauce is desired consistency. TO FREEZE: Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans. TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD: Preheat oven to 350ø F. (moderatae). Remove freezer wrap. Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 1/2 hours or until center is hot. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #184 Date: Mon, 05 Aug 1996 11:22:06 -0500 From: "R.

      <li>This is my Mom's invention. She used to make her own from scratch back in the 1940's. I remeber peering into the big brown bowl with the white beans soaking into it, but found she could use this recepie without loss of flavor and with much saving of time and effort. My brother and I used to use this for hugh parties in graduate student days. We once made it with 15 cans of beans for a big crowd and with no loss of flavor. You can make it , either parev, without the ffranks or Fleishig. Mix all ingredients and put in a covered baking dish or cassarole and bake in a 350 F oven for at least 30 min. You will neeed more time if you are making alot, as the mass has to heat through and cook for a while. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "W. Baker" &lt;wbaker@panix.com&gt; on May 12, 1998</li>

      <li>2 Tomatoes, or more</li>
      <li>1 Onion, (optional)</li>
      <li>16 ounces Sour Cream</li>

      <li>Shredded Cheese, (Mozzarlla and chedd</li>
      <li>1 can Olives (up To 2)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the refried beans and taco seasoning together (I also mix the chili's in with this, but some people put the chilis as a layer) Mix this really well (I used a food processor, but today I am going to use my mixer). This is the first layer. Put a layer of sour cream on top of the refried beans, taco seasoning and chilis. Next put a layer of well mixed/mushed avacados (you need enough to cover the pan, I use a cake pan normally) on top of everything else Next sprinkle cheeses on top (I just thought about it and I put the avacado first and then the sour cream, but I suppose it doesnt matter). I think the more cheese the better myself *grin*! Next cut up tomatoes and add as many as you like, which I like to use at least 2 cut up tomatoes. Last put chopped up olives. Put in the oven until the cheese is melted. I use a low heat so that everything else warms up. Last but not least pull out the chips and dip! Everyone really enjoys this dip. I hope you do too.

    <title>75-Minute Pizza Dough</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Warm water; about 105 degrees</li>
      <li>1 Envelope rapid rise dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Granulated white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 cups All purpose flour; plus extra as needed</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil; for oiling bowl</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sometimes you don't have the time to let pizza dough rise at night, nor do you have the forethought to use the slow-rise process and start the dough rising in the morning (using only a fraction of the ordinary amount of yeast). For those occasions, try this especially fast recipe. By using rapid-rise yeast, a warm oven, warm water, and a little sugar, you can make a dough that will rise in only forty minutes. This means the entire process of making a pizza can be done in about seventy-five minutes from start to finish. Since convenience is the watchword here, all-purpose flour is used instead of bread flour. Although it does not have quite the tenderness or full flavor of dough made using the Master Recipe for Pizza Dough, this dough makes a very good pizza in very little time. 1. Set oven to 200 degrees for 10 minutes, then turn oven off. 2. Meanwhile, in bowl of food processor fifted with either metal or plastic blade, add water and sprinkle in yeast and sugar. Pulse twice to dissolve yeast. Add all remaining ingredients and process until mixture forms cohesive mass. Dough should not be sticky (if it is, add 2 more tablespoons flour and pulse briefly) nor should it be dry and crumbly (if it is, add 1 more tablespoon water and pulse briefly). Let rest for 2 minutes. Process for another 30seconds. 3. Remove dough from food processor and knead by hand on floured work surface for 1 minute or until dough is smooth and satiny (dough will feel a bit tough at this point). 4. Very lightly oil large bowl with vegetable oil. Place dough in bowl (do not coat dough with oil) and cover with plastic wrap.Place in warm oven. Let rise for 40 minutes or until doubled.Remove from oven, punch down, remove from bowl, and separate into two round pieces. Let rest for 10 minutes under a damp dish towel, then shape, top, and bake in preheated 500-degree oven according to the following chart. Cook pizza an additional 2-3 minutes after adding cheese, or until cheese is completely melted.

Melt milk chocolate in a double boiler. Stir peanut butter into melted chocolate. Place crushed corn flakes in a bowl and stir chocolate/peanut butter mixture over them, mixing well. Spread mixture evenly into prepared pan and cool in refrigerator. MOUSSE: Melt semisweet chocolate in a double boiler. Cream butter and sugar in a mixer fitted with a paddle, beating until light and fluffy. Add sifted cocoa powder and mix well. Scrape down bowl and add chocolate. Continue mixing and add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Fold in heavy cream that has been beaten to firm peak. Mix well to incorporate, leaving no white streaks in the chocolate. Spread mousse over crust. Chill about 2 hours, until set. Cut into desired size bars (1 x 4-1/2 " cuts will yield about 2 dozen bars) with a sharp knife dipped in hot water. Place bars on a cooling rack that has been placed over a clean baking sheet. If bars are soft, place rack in freezer until ganache is ready. (Bars may be completed at this time or coated with ganache) GANACHE: Melt chocolate in double boiler. Mix sugar and heavy cream in a small saucepan and bring mixture to a slow boil over low heat (be careful not to scorch the cream). Pour cream over chocolate and stir with a whisk to incorporate, making sure all the chocolate is melted. Strain mixture to remove any pieces of unmelted chocolate. Let cool for about 1 hour. Pour ganache over firm bars to coat. Refrigerate for 1 hour to firm ganache. MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #42 From the MasterCook recipe list.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the refried beans and taco seasoning together (I also mix the chili's in with this, but some people put the chilis as a layer) Mix this really well (I used a food processor, but today I am going to use my mixer). This is the first layer. Put a layer of sour cream on top of the refried beans, taco seasoning and chilis. Next put a layer of well mixed/mushed avacados (you need enough to cover the pan, I use a cake pan normally) on top of everything else Next sprinkle cheeses on top (I just thought about it and I put the avacado first and then the sour cream, but I suppose it doesnt matter). I think the more cheese the better myself *grin*! Next cut up tomatoes and add as many as you like, which I like to use at least 2 cut up tomatoes. Last put chopped up olives. Put in the oven until the cheese is melted. I use a low heat so that everything else warms up. Last but not least pull out the chips and dip! Everyone really enjoys this dip. I hope you do too.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Bread flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Crumbled 7-grain cereal</li>
      <li>Flakes</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Nonfat dry milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter/margarine</li>
      <li>1/8 cups Dark molasses</li>
      <li>1 cup Plus 3 T plus 2 t warm</li>
      <li>(105ø-115ø) water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Add ingredients in the order listed. All ingredients must be at room temperature, unless otherwise noted. Select whole grain and baking control for light. Press start. Tent a piece of aluminum foil, shiny side down, over glass dome at start of baking. Remove when cooling begins. Bread will be ready in 4 hours and 10 minutes. A dark, moist loaf that's perfect for sandwiches! Such is the reward when slicing into a loaf of 7-Grain Bread. The machine's great kneading power makes it moist, and the 7-grain cereal makes it full of extra fiber.

      <li>1 package Glen-brew ale yeast</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Karl Lutzen Preparation Time: 4:00 Steep crystal malt for 30 minutes in 150 degree water. Sparge into brew pot of hot water and add malt extract. Bring to boil and add 1 ounce Fuggles. 20 minutes later add another ounce. At the 40 minute mark, toss in the final half ounce of fuggles. (Almost threw in a full ounce, but after tasting wort, decided against it---plenty bitter at this point.) Turn off heat and add Cascades. Stirred down the hops slowly and let sit for about 10 minutes. Strain all into fermenter containing ice water. Cooled. Pitched yeast. Single stage ferment. Keg, and age a few days. I came up with the name when helping install a phone system and after the job was done, I had pulled over seven miles of phone line...ugh! It's a good ale, but not the "Great Ale" that I'm still looking for...maybe it's in the fermenter now?

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: kathy@col.hp.com (Kathy Lankford) Date: 15 Dec 1993 15:46:30 GMT Another recipe from my favorite cookbook, Betty Crocker 1950. This is a very late reply to S. Havelson's request. You can make these in 60 minutes if you work VERY fast and they rise quickly. Mix all ingredients. Knead. Roll out to 12" x 7" rectangle. Prepare (see below) and place in a 9" round pan. Let rise 25-30 minutes. Bake 20-25 minutes at 400 degrees. For orange rolls: Mix ingredients. Spread the dough rectangle with half the mixture. Roll up the long way and cut 12 rolls. When baked, frost with the rest of the mixture. For cinnamon rolls: Spread rectangle with butter. Sprinkle on sugar and cinnamon. Roll up the long way. Cut 12 rolls. When baked, ice with the mixture of 1 Tbs butter, milk and powdered sugar. For pecan rolls: Use the same butter, sugar, and cinnamon topping as for cinnamon rolls, and roll up the same way. Before placing them in the pan, Coat pan with 1/4 cup melted butter, brown sugar and pecans. Put the rolls in and bake. Turn them out onto a cookie sheet immediately as they come out of the oven.

      <li>From the Arcata Co-op Bakery THis bread will not only nourish you, it will surprise you with its unique and delightful flavor and texture. Definetly worth the extra effort of finding the 9-grain mix ingredients. The mix will keep well in the refrigerator - we're sure you'll want to make this bread again (try a handful in pancakes!). Mix the water, molasses, malt and yeast. Add the 9 grain mix, flour, salt and oil (you can also make a sponge and wait, but it's not necessary). Mix, and knead dough well. Let rise, shape into loaves and let rise again in oiled bread pans. Bake at 350 F for 45 min. From: "Uprisings: Whole Grain Bakers Book" Posted by Theresa Merkling.

Here are some of my favorites from last year. Adapted from the Passover Gourmet Cookbook Cut onions, carrots, red peppers, celery, mushrooms and zucchini into bite-size pieces. Saute in veggie broth for 5 mins. until still slightly crunchy. Cut tomatoes into bite-size pieces and add the rest of the ingredients. Cover and cook for 20 minutes on simmer. This is delicious served over roasted potatoes. Serve as a vegetarian main dish and vegetable side dish for others. This serves about 4 vegetarian entrees when served with other seder dishes. Increase or substitute vegetables as desired. (Note: This is my seder main dish.) FATFREE DIGEST V96 #68 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 3/4 cups Flour; all-purpose</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 package Yeast; rapid-rise</li>
      <li>1 cup Hot water (125-130)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Margarine; softened nut filling-</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Almonds; sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Coconut; flaked</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Margarine; melted</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Set aside 1 cup flour. Mix remaining flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in mixer bowl. Stir in hot water and margarine. Add enough reserved flour to make soft dough. Knead 4 minutes. Roll dough to 14 x 8" rectangle. Place on greased baking sheet. Spread filling down center third. Cut 1" wide strips from sides of filling to dough edges. Alternately fold strips over filling. Cover. Place boiling water in large shallow pan on counter. Place baking sheet over pan and let dough rise for 15 min. Bake 20 min at 375 or until done. Remove from sheet and cool on wire rack. Can drizzle with a confectioner's sugar glaze, if desired. Fran's notes: on a hot, humid day, I didn't need the extra cup of flour. I used a 12 oz can of solo almond filling instead of the one listed here. I didn't have any 10x sugar, but a glaze would have been nice. Otherwise, I'll use a butter or egg wash to 'pretty' it up. This is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to try apricot, etc. filling. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

      <li>From: Jennifer Getty &lt;pixel39@skypoint.com&gt; Date: Wed, 14 Aug 1996 11:34:40 -0500 (CDT) In top of double boiler combine whites, sugar, corn syrup or cream of tartar, water, and salt but do not place over boiling water. Beat 30 seconds at low speed of electric mixer. Place over boiling water. Cook, beating constantly, until stiff peaks form (about 7 minutes). Don't overcook. Remove from boiling water. Add vanilla, beat until spreading consistency, about 2 minutes. Frosts 2 8- or 9-inch cake layers. Chocolate option: fold in 2 ounces melted and cooled unsweetened chocolate, just before frosting cake. Alternately, one could also substitute pareve margarine for the butter in a buttercream, but I don't know how that affects the taste. JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #001 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Box (1-lb) powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cocoa (up to)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Milk (sometimes 1/4 c is not enough so I put the rest as needed in after it is cooked)</li>
      <li>1 Stick margarine</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: sue@ccrwest.org (Susan DeMeritt) Date: 2 Feb 1995 12:35:04 -0000 For those of you who like fudge and do not like the mess and fuss of boiling the chocolate down and checking the temp., etc., you will love this recipe for 5-minute fudge. (I learned this at a Tupperware party about 2-3 years ago). My family loves it. Mix sugar and coca together thoroughly in large microwavable bowl. Pour milk in sugar mixture but do not mix. Set the stick of margarine right on top of the mixture. Microwave on high for 2 1/2 minutes. After the mixture comes out of the microwave, mix well and add vanilla. If it seems to dry this is when you would add the extra milk if needed. (However, if it is not too dry do not add extra milk as it will become to thin and it will not solidify. If for some reason you do add too much milk and it gets too runny then you can use the mixture on top of ice cream.) At this point you can add nuts or whatever else you like in your fudge. Put the fudge out on a plate that is covered with aluminum foil. Put in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes. It will solidify pretty quickly.

Season to taste. Sprinkle with flour and cook till flour is browned and incorporated well. Adjust seasoning and coloring to taste. Make pies by putting scoops of about 1/4 cup on the base crust. Egg glaze around the filling and top with the puff pastry, using the egg glaze as a "glue" (try not to leave large air pockets). Cut around the filling, creating individual pies. Brush the top with more egg glaze for color and bake at 350 degrees till puffed and browned. Fm: Dan Perlman 71370,1423 From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>From: Dot &amp; Tim McChesney &lt;jrjet@WHIDBEY.NET&gt; Date: Tue, 2 Jul 1996 18:33:15 -0700 Here ya go - This can be made in a pizza pan type dish or a deeper one, we like the deeper dish. On the bottom, 2 cans bean dip - we usually use Tostito's black bean dip - it is spicier Next - guacamole - We make ours by adding lemon juice, tabasco or other hot sauce, and salsa to the avocados Third layer - 16 ounce sour cream with a package taco seasoning mixed in (can add a little mayo to this if ya like) Fourth layer - chopped green onion Fifth - sliced black olives Sixth - diced tomato Seventh - Shredded sharp cheddar That is it - we use toritlla chips or Fritos, but it is so good we have been known to use anything to dip it out with!!

Set aside. layer: Lettuce, celery, onions, peas, miracle whip/milk mixture, cheese, bacon pieces. Refrigerate overnight. You can vary the quantities of all the ingredients to suit you. You could also add a layer of ripe olives or something. The only layers that need to be in order are the lettuce, salad dressing mix, and topped with the cheese and bacon. The celery, onions, peas, etc. doesn't really matter the order they are in. Ripe olives I would put on top with the cheese and bacon layer. Mm-recipes Digest V3 #210 From the MealMaster recipe list.

Tent a piece of aluminum foil, shiny side down, over glass dome at start of baking. Remove when cooling begins. Bread will be ready in 4 hours and 10 minutes.

In a 13" x 9" pan layer it with the lettuce, then cut the green peppers and layer them next. Next is to cut the onion and add it, then the box of frozen peas. Fry the bacon till it is nice and crispy. Crumble it and layer it on the salad. Add the cheese. On top of all of this you add the sauce. It tastes best when it is cold.

Leave in pot of water for 24 hours. Day 2: 1. Put pot on stove and boil for half an hour. 2. Set aside for 24 hours. Day 3: 1. Put pot back on stove and boil for half an hour. 2. Add sugar and leave for 24 hours. Day 4: 1. Simmer on low flame until marmalade is thick (3-4 hours). 2. Pour into jars. Seal lids. This stuff is great to roast chicken with.

      <li>1 cup Couscous</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>

      <li>5 cups Fresh spinach; about 5 oz., stems r</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup Meunster cheese; grated</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine couscous, boiling liquid, and salt in a large bowl and cover with a plate. Let sit for 5 min. then fluff with fork. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic and onion 10 mins. or until tender. Add drained tomatoes and cook 10 mins. more, stirring frequently. Stir tomato mixture into couscous and mix in reserved tomato juice, basil, pine nuts, spinach, and pepper. Spread half the couscous mixture into a 12x7x2 in. or other shallow (2.5 qt) baking pan. Sprinkle on cheese, then top with remaining couscous. Cover with foil and bake at 375 F for 25 min. or until hot and bubbly. NOTES : this could easily be made with less oil (just enough to keep onions from sticking), little or not salt (I'd prefer soy sauce anyway for flavor), and the cheese could be left out for a vegan or pareve meal.</li>

      <li>1 large Tomato; peeled, seeded and finely diced</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Potatoes; cooked and cut into 1/4inch dice</li>
      <li>2 cups Fresh corn kernels; (about 5 ears)</li>
      <li>1/2 bunches Chopped Italian parsley</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Grated Anejo cheese</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Coarse salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the masa harina, water and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small ball of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Cover with a damp towel until ready to use. Heat the oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and sautJ until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Ad the garlic, jalapeno, cumin, salt and pepper and sautJ 1 minute longer to release the aromas. Add the tomato, potatoes and corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid from the tomatoes is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley and cheese and correct the seasoning. Set aside to cool. Divide the dough into 24 golfball size pieces, moistening your hands with water to prevent sticking if necessary. Flatten balls to 3 inch disks. Place a heaping teaspoon of stuffing on the empanada and close by pressing the edges together with your fingers. Shape into a half moon. Repeat until all the halfmoons are formed. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the empanaditas on top. Brush with the glaze and prick with a fork to make steam holes. Bake for about 2530 minutes, or until golden. Remove and transfer to a rack to cool slightly. Serve warm.

      <li>Date: Tue, 19 Mar 1996 18:30:18 -0500 From: "Vernon E. Phipps Jr." &lt;cook4u@vivanet.com&gt; 1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let it dissolve for 5 minutes. Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and heat until the shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm. 2. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk mix. Sift in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs and 2 cups flour. Beat briskly until well blended. Add the remaining 2-1/2 cups flour and beat until smooth. Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1 hour. 3. Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto it. This dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent sticking, but is easy to handle. Pat the dough into a round about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 3-inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts, placing them (and the doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1 inch apart. These don't spread much; they rise. Preheat oven to 450F. Let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered. Bake about 10 minutes or a little longer, until they have a touch of golden brown. Remove from the oven. Have ready the melted butter and a brush. On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar. Brush each doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon sugar. Serve hot.

    <title>Baked Custard-Style Rice Pudding</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>6 To 8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 cups (1 1/2 quarts) milk</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 Vanilla bean, split lengthwise, -or-</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>2 large Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>Ground cinnamon, for sprinkling</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Rinse a heavy saucepan with cold water; leave wet. Place 4 cups of the milk, the sugar, salt and vanilla bean in the pan (if using vanilla extract, do not add it now). Cover and bring slowly to a boil. Stir in the rice with a large fork. Cover and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the rice is quite tender, about 40 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean; scrape the seeds into the rice mixture and stir in. 2. Preheat the oven to 400 F, with a rack in the center. Butter a 12-inch oval pudding or gratin dish or other large shallow baking dish. In a bowl, beat the egg, egg yolks and the remaining 2 cups milk until combined (if you are using vanilla extract, add it now). Add this mixture and the raisins to the rice and stir to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Set the baking dish in a roasting pan, and place in the oven. Pour enough hot tap water into the roasting pan to reach about halfway up the sides of the baking dish. 3. Bake for 25 minutes. Stir the pudding gently with a fork to redistribute the rice. Bake for another 25 minutes. Stir again; lightly sprinkle the surface of the pudding with the cinnamon. Bake until the top of the pudding has crusted over lightly and is spotted with gold; the pudding should still be slightly liquid, another 25 minutes. (The total baking time is about 1 1/4 hours. The timing can vary based on the depth and size of the baking dish; do not overbake.) 4. Remove the pudding from the water bath and cool on a wire rack. Serve lukewarm or slightly chilled.

    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice tops from apples. Carefully remove cores, taking care not to cut through to bottoms. 2. Peel skin from orange, leaving the bitter white membrane. Dice orange peel. Juice orange. Discard membrane. Coarsely chop pecans. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the melted butter in the bottom of a 9- by 12-inch baking dish. In a small mixing bowl combine cranberries, orange peel, orange juice, pecans, remaining butter, maple syrup, and cinnamon. 3. Place 1/8 of the mixture into each cored apple. Put apples into baking dish. Cover pan with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until a knife inserted in the side of apples meets no resistance (5 minutes). Apples will be tender but should still hold their shape.

      <li>6 Ears fresh corn</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Butter; melted</li>
      <li>Salt &amp; pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>SERVES 4 I had never tasted this dish, nor had I ever even heard of it, until one of my staff in Chicago, Mark Blank, told me about his summer days on his grandfather's farm in Indiana. This was one of his favorite dishes and he even brought me the device that his grandfather had made for this special dish. You need a corn scraper in order to do this properly, and it can be done only with fresh corn. I just bought an "original" Lees corn cutter and creamer and it seems to work quite well. When Mark was sitting in a corner of the studio scraping, he said, "You know, this won't taste right. You have to have bees flying about your head while you scrape corn in the lndiana sun. We have no bees!" The dish is quite delicious, nevertheless. You will think that there is actually cream in this dish, but there is none. Scrape the corn from the cob and cream it, using a corn cutter/creamer. Place the mixture in a greased baking dish and pour the melted butter on top. Bake uncovered at 375ø for about 30 minutes, or until the top lightly browns. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Fish fillets (I use red snapper)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt (I don't use, my hubby doesn't like salt)</li>
      <li>1 dash Pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Margarine or butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Grated onion</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>If fish fillets are large, cut into 5 or 6 serving pieces. Sprinkle both sides of fish with salt and pepper (I don't). Mix margarine or butter (I use butter), lemon juice and onion. Dip fish into margarine/butter mixture; arrange in ungreased square pan, 9 x 9 x 2 inches. (I always use a longer pan).Pour remaining mixture over fish. Cook uncovered in 350 degree oven until fish flakes easily with fork, 25 to 30 minutes. I served this with kind of a rice pilaf: I stir fried sliced fresh mushrooms, celery and onion, sauteed, and then added cooked rice to the veggies, and also had fresh asparagus.

    <recipetext>
      <li>These are from &lt;&lt;Vegetarian Celebrations&gt; by Nava Atlas and are more &lt;generic Sephardic recipes that the author feels go well with latkes than chanukah recipes per se. I haven't tried the eggplant, but I like the beans &amp; her version of Israeli Salad is pretty standard. Eggplant and peppers, two well-loved vegetables in both the Eastern European and Sephardic traditions, are combined in a delicious casserole. Preheat oven to 350°. Place the diced eggplant in a colander &amp; salt it. Let stand for 30 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and saute over moderate heat until it begins to turn golden. Add the eggplant and just enough water to keep the bottom of the skillet moist. Cover &amp; cook, stirring frequently. When the eggplant is about half done, stir in the basil &amp; cumin. Cook until the eggplant is tender, adding small amounts of water as needed while cooking to keep the skillet moist. Stir in the wheat germ and season to taste with salt &amp; pepper. Oil a large, shallow baking dish &amp; pat the eggplant mixture into it. Rinse the skillet. Heat the additional oil. Add the peppers and saute over high heat, stirring frequently, until they begin to brown. Lower the heat, stir in the tomatoes, and saute for a minute or two, just until they begin to soften. Slowly sprinkle in the flour, stirring just until it disappears.Then, slowly stir in the milk and bring to a simmer. Sprinkle in the cheese, a bit at a time, followed by the cayenne. Let the mixture simmer until thickened and the cheese is completely melted. Pour over the eggplant. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes,or until the top is golden brown and bubbly. Let cool for 10 minutes, then scoop out sections with a spatula to serve. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #79 Date: Sun, 17 Nov 96 10:24:07 CST From: bgl@leass.PCC.COM (Barbara Leass)</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Minced Fresh Herbs</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Asiago Or Parmesan Cheese; coarsely grated</li>
      <li>8 ounces Dungeness Crab Meat; well picked over</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Saute the onion and garlic in olive oil over moderate heat until soft but not brown. While onions are cooking, blanch the spinach in lightly salted boiling water for a few seconds until wilted. Drain and immediately plunge into ice water to stop the cooking and set the color. Drain again and gently squeeze as much of the moisture as possible out of the spinach with a clean tea towel. Coarsely chop spinach and combine with onion mixture. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Over an open flame or under a broiler, char peppers on all sides. Remove and cover loosely with plastic for a few minutes to sweat and then scrape off charred skin with the point of a knife. Remove and discard seeds and stems and cut peppers into long thick slices. Lightly butter or oil a small terrine or loaf pan (8x4x2 1/2 inches) and line the bottom with buttered waxed paper or parchment. Beat the eggs briefly together with the herbs and season with salt and pepper. Layer one third of spinach mixture on bottom of pan. Top with 1/3 of roasted red pepper, 1/3 of the cheese and 1/3 of the crab. Pour about a third of the egg mixture over and gently tap pan and poke mixture to evenly distribute eggs. Continue layering in this way. Place terrine in a larger baking pan and pour enough hot tap water to come at least 2/3 of the way up the sides of the terrine. Place in a preheated 325 degree oven, cover with parchment or foil and bake in a preheated 325 degree oven until eggs are just set. Remove from water bath and let sit 15-20 minutes before unmolding if serving warm.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make the Bean Filling: Coarsely mash the beans. Stir in the onion, garlic, chilies, chili powder, cumin and vinegar. Make the Beef Filling: Saute the beef, onion, and garlic and a skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat into small bits. Cook until the beef is browned and the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Drain off fat in a colander. Wipe out skillet with paper towels, and return the meat mixture to it, off the heat. Stir in the chilis, chili powder, cumin and salt to taste. Finish the dish: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place a disk of daugh on a work surface. Spoon 2 scant tablespoons of bean filling onto one half leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Top with 1 tablespoon grated cheese if you like. Brush the edges of the dough with water. Fold the dough over the filling, forming a half circle. With the tines of a fork, press the edges together firmly, and poke a few holes, in the top to let the steam escape. REpeat until you have used all the filling. Use the same procedure with the meat filling topping with 1 tablespoon salsa if you wish. Place the empanadas on a baking sheet, and coast them lightly with vegetable oil spray. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Coat fish lightly with mayo or olive oil and lay in a shallow baking dish. Put in a 350F oven to bake. While fish is cooking, saute onion until translucent, add garlic, tomatoes, and olives and cook just until tomatoes collapse. Just before fish is done, top with crumbled feta and cook just until cheese softens/melts. Top with veggies and serve. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /FISH From rec.food.cooking archives.

While the eggplant is baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saute pan until very hot. Add onion and garlic and saute until you can smell the aroma, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, toss with onion, and saute lightly. Add marjoram and saute for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Place cooled tomato mixture in a bowl and add olives, bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese; mix well. When eggplant is tender, remove from oven and let cool slightly. (Leave oven at 350 F for baking the stuffed eggplant.) Scoop the middle of the eggplant out, leaving 1 inch of flesh all the way around. Do not break the skin. Let the eggplant flesh cool, then chop roughly and add to the stuffing. Season with salt and pepper. Place the stuffing back into the 4 eggplant halves. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until stuffing is golden brown. Serve hot. Recipe is from _Cooking with Caprial American Bistro Fare_ by Caprial Pence.

You should add the egg white, beaten to firm peaks, last. Finally add the flavorings, vanilla extract and/or nutmeg. Don't use much nutmeg it is quite stong in the custard. Also don't beat it too much or you will kill the egg white. When it is all incorporated, pour it into a baking pan (for individual servings use individual custard cups) Place the pan in a pan of warm water and bake at 300-325 degs for about an hour. Testing custard is abit tricky. after about an hour slip a knife between the edge of the custard and the pan. It should be clean. The center should still be soft. It will continue to cook for a bit after you take it out. If you suspect that the center is done too much put the pan in a pan of cold/ice water to stop the cooking process. You can use the knife test to see if it is too doine in the middle.

      <li>1 cup Grated mild cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; scraped pulp</li>
      <li>2 Bayleaves; rubbed fine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I have a number of old cookbooks with one going back to it's first publishing in 1908. Here is a recipe from "The Gentleman's Companion, Vol 1, Exotic Cookery Book" 1946 edition, first published in 1939, by Charles H. Baker, Jr. Most of the recipes are in narrative with anecdotes about how the author found the recipes around the world. One secret is that fish is painted inside and out with lime juice, salted lightly, and iced that way for at least 4 hours before cooking. Take well greased baking dish; dispose fish on bottom. Mix chopped nuts with cheese, garlic pulp and onion, moistening with milk to make stiff paste. Salt and cayenne to taste, and all seasonings. Then spread your fish with this toothsome blanket, and cover with dry fine bread crumbs. On this put generous walnuts of butter and brown in medium oven around 350 to 375 Fahrenheit, basting well. Chopped almonds, Brazils, hazelnuts or pecans do equally well, but the cashew is traditional in the Philippines.

    <recipetext>
      <li>These came out of the Jan/Feb 96 Chile Pepper Magazine written by Barb &amp; Ron Kroll. I can't say that I've tried any of them. Hope they help. Heat the oil with the paprika, add the onions and saute until soft. Add the cumin, oregano, chile powder, salt, and ground beef. Cook until the meat is no longer pink, but don't let it get too brown. Refrigerate until the next day so that the juice sets. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees. To make the crust: Sift the dry ingredients together. Add the liquid ingredients and beat to form a stiff dough. Divide the dough into 20 pieces and roll each into a thin circle. Put a spoonful of the filling on half of the circle and divide the egg slices, the olives and raisins among the 20 empanadas. Fold over the dough, wet the edge with milk, fold over again to make a border. If you like them shiny, paint with glaze before putting them in the oven. Place on a sheet pan and bake until brown. Serve with pebre sauce. Heat Scale: Mild Note: This recipe requires advance preparation.

      <li>2 tablespoons Finely slice green onions</li>
      <li>2 Cloves finely chopped garlic; divided</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Ground turkey or hamburger (optional--replace with about 1 cup mixture of mushrooms; more cabbage, bean sprouts and/or carrots)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Grated ginger root</li>
      <li>1 pound Egg roll skins (14-16) found in produce section of grocery store</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>submitted by: kerr@patriot.net (Kathy Kerr, Arlington, VA) These can be made with or without meat. They have a different texture than fried egg rolls but it's worth it because I hate greasy egg rolls! Also, deep frying is SO messy. These were still pretty crispy! Mix soy sauce with corn starch. Set aside. Spray non-stick skillet or wok with nonstick cooking spray or heat one tablespoon cooking oil. Over high heat stir-fry 1-2 cloves garlic and ginger for a few seconds. Add cabbage, bean sprouts, carrot and green onions. Stir fry a few minutes until cabbage is wilted. If cooking meat, remove vegetables from pan. Add remaining 1-2 cloves garlic. Add ground turkey or hamburger. Stir fry until no longer pink. Drain off any fat. Add reserved soy sauce/corn starch and the vegetables. Cook 1 minute or so until thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool a little. TO MAKE EGG ROLLS: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Turn eggroll skin so it looks like a diamond. Place 1/4 cup filling just below the center. Fold the lower point of the diamond over the filling tucking it under the filling. Fold the left and right corners over that. Tightly roll the egg roll. Moisten the top corner with a bit of water to prevent it from unrolling. VOILA! Repeat til you run out of skins or filling. (Note: Keep the eggroll skins in their wrapper or cover with a moist towel so they don't dry out.) Should make at least 14 egg rolls. Place eggrolls seam side down on the pan. They can be close together but not touching. Lightly spray the egg rolls with the nonstick cooking spray. Bake 15-20 minutes until golden brown.

      <li>1 Clove garlic; minced</li>

      <li>2 ounces Smoked salmon; sliced</li>
      <li>2 ounces Sharp cheddar cheese; grated</li>
      <li>1 Tomato; thickly sliced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Butter casseroles (custard cups work well). Press 2 to 3 tsp. bread crumbs on bottom and sides of each. Blend remaining crumbs with 1 T. butter, reserve. Break an egg into each dish. Mash garlic with cream cheese and gently place over eggs. Add smoked salmon, folding long strips as needed. Sprinkle grated cheddar over the salmon. Put 1 fat tomato slice (from middle of the tomato) on each dish (dice the rest for saled).

      <li>There's a bakery near me called Aunt Mary's (are you listening, Sallie?) and they have the most wonderful basil-parmesan scones. One day I experimented and was pleased to find a pretty good facsimile. Just add the above ingredients along with all the other dry ingredients and proceed as above. These are a nice change of pace from Italian or garlic bread. Or cut with smaller cutter and serve as appetizer (don't forget to reduce baking time if smaller).

    <title>Basil Cheese Torta with Red Bell Pepper Strips and Pine Nuts</title>
    <category>Appetizers</category>
    <category>Vegetarian</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Cream cheese; softened</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Butter; softened</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Basil pesto</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Provolone, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Toasted pine nuts</li>
      <li>1 Red bell pepper; roasted, peeled, seeded, and cut into 3" x 3/8" strips</li>
      <li>1 small Jar sun-dried tomatoes (packed in olive oil)</li>
      <li>Fresh basil for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix cream cheese and butter with a fork; add pesto and mix well. Line a small (3-cup) loaf pan or bowl with plastic wrap, leaving several inches of overhang on each side. Make a thin layer of provolone slices on the bottom and partially up the sides. Spread 1/3 of the pesto mixture over the cheese; artistically arrange 2 or 3 sun-dried tomatoes, 4-6 bell pepper strips, and about 1 tablespoon toasted pine nuts over the pesto. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used (reserving some of the pine nuts to sprinkle on top), pressing down well between layers. Chill overnight or for several days. Serve at room temperature on a platter wreathed with fresh basil sprigs. Additional toasted pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes cut into flowers, red bell pepper strips, and fresh basil sprigs may be used as garnish. NOTE: Torta may be presented inverted or not. Keeps several weeks refrigerated. Although best served at room temperature, it slices best chilled. I like to serve it on a platter adorned with grape leaves and small clusters of red and white grapes. VARIATIONS: = = =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Use lemon pesto; substitute slivered toasted almonds for the pine nuts; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and add 1 teaspoon lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture. Use purple pesto; omit the red pepper if desired and increase the sun-dried tomatoes. Use cinnamon basil pesto; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and the red peppers if desired, and use pecans instead of pine nuts.

      <li>2 tablespoons Instant nonfat dry milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cornstarch or arrowroot</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a small saucepan combine milk, onion, carrot, nutmeg and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover, remove from heat and allow to steep for ten minutes. Pour the warm milk through a strainer, pressing down on the vegetables to obtain all the juices. Let cool. Combine dry milk, cornstarch or arrowroot and flour. Add one or two TAB cooled milk to the dry mixture and stir to a smooth paste. Return the milk to the saucepan, add the flour paste and stir over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens. If sauce will not be used immediately, cover and refrigerate. Cold sauce will thicken; thin with a little flavored cooking juice, wine or stock. Makes about 1 cup; recipe is easily doubled. VVegetables steeped in hot milk add flavor to this versatile sauce, which can replace the butter-flour-milk white sauce in any of your recipes. It also forms the base of a salt-free cheese sauce that in its turn can dress vegetables, open-fac sandwiches, macaroni or baked potatoes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is one of my favourite luncheon meals. I serve it on a bed of fresh spinach leaves, garnished with orange slices. The recipe originally called for low/non fat sour cream, but I found that the sour cream tends to go runny if it's left for several hours so I tried a combination of half nonfat/half fullfat. That seems to work well. Of course, for those of you not calorie concious, you could use all full fat sour cream! :) This does taste better if it's refrigerated at least 3-4 hours before serving but overnight is even better. In a large bowl combine the chicken, celery, chives, sour cream and basil; mix lightly with a fork. Just before serving, add pepper and salt to taste.

      <li>Margarine, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325~ F. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour and salt. Cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly mix in enough of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If necessary, add up to 1 additional Tablespoon of milk. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll the crackers paper thin. They will look almost translucent. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops with salt and gently roll over the dough with your rolling pin. With a sharp knife, carefully cut the crackers into 2-inch squares. Handling them gently, transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Yield: 95-100. VARIATIONS: This basic recipe can be the starting point for much interesting experimentation. Simply varying flour or liquid can produce an entirely new cracker unavailable anywhere but in your kitchen. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Basil; minced</li>
      <li>1/2 Stick unsalted butter; softened</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Fresh thyme leaves; minced</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Finely grated fresh lemon zest</li>
      <li>2 Poussins; (about 1 pound each) or 2 small cornish hens (about 1 1/4 pounds each)</li>
      <li>1 small Lemon; halved</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons White wine</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Chicken stock</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GARNISH</li>
      <li>Basil and thyme leaves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a bowl, stir together the basil, butter, thyme, zest and salt and pepper to taste until combined well. Spoon mixture onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form into a 3-inch long log. Chill compound butter, wrapped well in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 30 minutes, and up to 3 days. Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Discard gizzards form birds and trim necks flush with bodies if necessary. Rinse birds inside and out and pat dry. Starting at neck end of each bird, slide fingers between meat and skin to loosen skin (be careful not to tear skin). Cut butter into eight 1/4-inch thick slices and gently push 4 slices under skin of each bird, putting 1 slice over each breast half and thigh. Tie legs of each bird together with kitchen string and secure wings to sides with wooden picks or bamboo skewers. Arrange birds in a flameproof roasting pan large enough to hold them without crowding. Gently rub birds with lemon halves, squeezing juice over them, and season with salt and pepper. Roast birds in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until an instant read thermometer inserted in thickest part of a thigh registers 170 degrees. Transfer birds to a platter and loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Add wine and stock to the roasting pan and deglaze over moderate heat, scraping up brown bits. Transfer jus to a small saucepan. Skim fat from jus and simmer until reduced to about 1/3 cup. Garnish birds with herbs and serve with jus.

Dip 1 or 2 slices of bread in the milk mixture. Gently squeeze as much liquid as possible from the bread without tearing it. Place the bread in a 12 inch round or oval au grain dish and cover with a slice of prosciutto, several arugula leaves dipped in olive oil, some slices of basil torta, and a few tomato slices. Drizzle sparingly with pesto. Repeat the layering, overlapping the bread slices slightly, until the dish is filled. Beat the eggs with salt and pepper to taste and pour evenly over the layers in the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The following day remove the dish from the refrigerator and let warm to room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Drizzle the top with the cream and bake until puffy and browned, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Serve immediately. 6 portions. Basic Pesto: Process the basil, garlic, and walnuts (or pine nuts) in a food processor fitted with a steel blade or in 2 batches in a blender, until finely chopped. With the machine running, pour in the oil in a thin, steady stream. Add the cheeses, a big pinch of salt, and a liberal grinding of pepper. Process briefly to combine. Remove to a bowl and cover until ready to use. Yield 2 cups. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /EGGS REFRIGERATE OVERNIGHT From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: dmferrell@happy.uccs.edu Date: Mon, 25 Apr 1994 23:35:57 GMT 1. Slice the onions into very thin rounds. Put 3-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil in a heavy skillet and bring to medium high heat. Saute the onion rings until just starting to turn golden. Remove from skillet and set aside. 2. Remove the seeds and ribs from the peppers and slice into julienne strips. Break the florets of cawliflower into bite size pieces. Thinly slice the mushrooms and make matchstick slices of the zucchini. Place all the sliced veggies into the skillet and saute until just starting to turn limp--about 4 minutes or so. Remove from the skillet and drain well. 3. Mix together the eggs, flour, milk, salt and pepper and whip with a wisk until very frothy. 4. Use a deep quiche dish or a 10" deep dish pie plate. Spray well with an olive oil cooking spray. Wash the basil and spinach and pat dry with a paper towel. Line the cooking dish with the basil and spinach so that the points of the leaves overlap the edge of the dish by about 1/2". Spray lightly again so that the leaves stay together. Gently pour about the 1/4 of the egg mixture over the leaves. Place about 1/4 of the veggies into the cooking dish, making sure they are spread around. Sprinkle a handful of the parmesan cheese over all. Repeat the eggs, veggies and cheese until the dish is filled and you have ended with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees until done--about 25-30 minutes. The eggs will really puff up, the tips of the spinach and basil will turn a little brown and the cheese forms a nice crusty top on the quiche. During the summer when our vegetable garden is at its peak, I substitute other veggies such as eggplant and hot peppers and green beans and leeks for the onions.

    <recipetext>
      <li>I thought I'd share with you this variant on the traditional Guacamole I knocked up last night: I didn't expect to taste the basil but it really shone through very strongly. I put this down to its strong affinity to tomato. Also I was concerned the pepper would spoil the other flavour but its aroma blended in to produced a slightly sweeter aftertaste.

    <title>Basic Yogurt Cheese</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>16 ounces Nonfat plain yogurt</li>
      <li>Coffee filters</li>
      <li>large Colander (the larger the better)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Line a large colander with coffee machine filters. Place the yogurt into the filters, spreading over as large an area as possible. Place colander over a large dish to drain for 24 hours. (refrigerate) The watery whey will drain out of the yogurt, leaving a cheeselike substance similar in consistency to cream cheese. The longer the yogurt drains, the firmer it will become as more whey drains out. (Although many people drain it only for 24 hours, I like to start early and let it drain a little longer for firmer consistency.) And though it's not essential, I think I get better results if I replace the coffee filters once or twice during the process (the yogurt will be becoming drier and firmer and is usually easy for me to remove it from one filter to the next. If you choose to do this, you will notice less and less whey draining out each time as the yogurt becomes "cheese". This method is easy for me since I have the items on hand and I like it better than using cheesecloth. Some people really love the yogurt funnels that you can buy at many culinary cookshops. Plain yogurt cheese is 12 calories per tablespoon and has no fat. Yogurt cheese may be used as a substitute in cheese balls, spreads, dips, cheesecakes, etc. It is a good alternative to any of the following: ricotta cheese, sour cream, cream cheese or mayonnaise.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: viv@tauon.ph.unimelb.edu.au (Viviane Buzzi) Date: Tue, 3 May 1994 04:02:25 GMT Recently, there was a request for desserts using fresh herbs. Here is an unusual use of herbs in a dessert...I hope you like it. I got it from an article in a magazine a few years back...I can't remember whether it was Vogue or Harper's Bazaar. This is a creme anglaise, infused with fresh basil and mint. Serve in a pitcher with summer fruits...some suggestions given in the recipe are: pitted cherries and red currants, mixed berried with plum, peach and nectarine sections and a mixture of various melons. Sprinkle with superfine sugar and toss gently. Let stand for at least 30 mins. to form a light, natural syrup. Serve the fruit cold, drizzling each portion with some of the sauce. Place the half and half in a heavy saucepan (not aluminium) over medium heat. Scrape the vanilla seeds into the liquid; add the vanilla pod and bring to a boil. Place the egg yolks, sugar, and salt in a bowl; whisk until combined. Very gradually whisk the hot liquid into the egg-yolk mixture. Return to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the custard lightly coats the back of the spoon, usually 5-8 minutes. Do not allow to boil. Remove from the heat and strain. Let cool. Bring a small pan of water to the boil. Add the basil and mint leaves; blanch for 30 seconds. Drain and immediately plunge the herbs into a bowl of ice water (this will set the green colour). Remove the herbs from water and gently press out excess water. Place the cooled custard and the herbs in a blender and puree. Add Chartreuse to taste and transfer to a glass pitcher. Keep the custard refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap. Makes 2 1/3 cups (6-8 servings). This recipe was created by a chef called Gary Danko. He claims this sauce is also perfect with a chocolate mousse cake... I think he is right!! In fact, I think it would go quite nicely also with a rich chocolate parfait. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <category>Cookbook</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Molasses</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Basil; roughly chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Garlic; minced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 Whole boneless chicken breasts**</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>4 Peaches; halved and pitted</li>
      <li>NOTE: ** 10 to 12 ounces each. If you can't find boneless chicken breasts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>with the two halves still attached, substitute 8 halves. INSTRUCTIONS: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar to a boil and cook until it is reduced by half, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the molasses and black pepper, remove from the heat and set aside. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the basil, garlic and olive oil, and mix well. Rub the chicken breasts with this mixture, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, and grill over a medium fire, skin side down, until the skin is crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the breasts over and grill for another 6 minutes. To check for doneness, nick one of the breasts at the fattest point; the meat should be fully opaque with no traces of pink. As the chicken breasts are finishing up, place the peaches on the fire, cut side down, and grill until they are nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Flip them over, brush the cut side with the balsamic glaze, and continue to cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the peaches from the grill, give them another coat of glaze, and serve whole or sliced with the chicken breasts.

      <li>Boil Chinese mushrooms for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off, and discard stems; then, chop into very small pieces. Shell, devein and wash prawns. Chop into very small pieces Peel and crush water chestnuts with the flat side of the cleaver. If you don't have a cleaver, chop the water chestnuts into very fine pieces. Combine mushrooms, prawns, water chestnuts, pork and green onion. Add all other ingredients and mix well. 1 teaspoon of filling is used for each wonton. * * * With one corner of the skin toward you, place 1 teaspoon of filling about an inch from the corner. Fold one corner to cover the filling. Told once more...about 3/4 inch. Turn the won ton so that the triangel is toward you. Dampen the left corner with a little water. Swing the right corner away from you and place it on top of the dampened left corner. As you make this fold, simultaneously pull the filling toward you with your middle finger. You should finish with a little "hat-like" effect. SOURCE: Chopstick, Cleaver and Wok. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Sliced celery; optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I first had this dish on Little Exuma Island in the Bahamas, where the locals eat it regularly for breakfast. They use any white meat fish that is not too oily and the small Tabasco type peppers that are very hot. They use the peppers in both the red and green stages. Just before serving they will also put a dollop of butter on the soup. I have modified mine or Americanized it if you will, by lightly sauteing the bacon until it is very lightly browned. I do this only because it looks better than" white" boiled bacon to the American eye. I also add just a few sliced vegetables at times for the same reason. (carrots and celery ) Feel free to modify the recipe this way if you wish. When cooking only for myself, I eat it the Bahamian way and spicier than most Americans like it. Bon Appetit ! In a large saucepan bring the water to a boil and add the potatoes, onion, bacon, salt, pepper and minced chilies. If you are using any celery or carrot, add these at this time too. Gently boil until the potatoes are just tender to the fork and add the fish. Reduce the heat and simmer until the fish is just cooked. ( It will be white and opaque. ) Add a small piece of butter if desired, correct the seasonings and serve at once. Makes 4 servings. Note - Depending on how hot the chilies are that you are using you may want to use more or less depending on you taste. You will find that chilies used in a liquid tend to be hotter than in solid foods so be cautious. Try to stay away from strong oily fish when you make this dish. The flavor should be light and delicate. For a richer soup substitute clam juice for the water.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425F degrees. Place water, salt, and butter in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, toss baking soda and flour together. When water is boiling, add flour all at once, stimng constantly with a wooden spoon. Continue to stir over low heat for another minute, until the mixture is well combined and has formed a ball. Pull off walnut-size pieces of dough and quickly roll each into a ball. Flatten slightly and sprinkle with chives. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet and press with heel of the hand until very thin. Prick with a fork in several places. Continue until all dough is used. Bake for 15 minutes or until browned and crisp. Allow to cool slightly on a rack. Makes approximately 48 wafers SOURCE: Lee Bailey's Soup Meals (1989:isbn0517573040) Notes: Lee's Intro: These wafers tend to toughen up if allowed to sit around too long so they are best eaten shortly after baking.

Place the ground espresso into a cup or small bowl. Heat the water to boiling and pour it over the espresso powder. Allow the grounds to steep for 5 minutes. Strain the coffee through a double layer of cheesecloth. Measure 1/4 cup of the coffee and set aside. In a large howl, using a wire whisk, stir together the flour, baking soda and salt. Sift the mixture onto a large piece of waxed paper. In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes until creamy. Gradually add the sugar, blending well between additions, and scraping down the sides of the bowl when necessary. Add the eggs one at a time and beat until combined. Add vanilla and sour cream. On low speed, add half of the flour mixture and beat until combined. Add the 1/4 cup of espresso, and mix well. Add the remaining flour mixture. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan and a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and set on a wire rack to cool completely. CHOCOLATE CHUNK MOUSSE: Put the chocolate in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Process for 20 to 30 seconds, until finely ground. In a small saucepan, combine the milk, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves and the milk comes to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of the Bailey's. With the motor of the food processor running, pour the hot milk through the feed tube. Process for 10 to 20 seconds, until the chocolate is completely melted. Using a spatula, scrape the chocolate mixture into a large bowl and cool for about 5 minutes, until tepid. In the 4 l/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the mascarpone at medium-low speed just until softened. Gradually add the rest of the Bailey's, scraping down the side of the bowl as necessary. Switch to the wire whip attachment, and beating on medium speed, add the heavy cream. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue beating 2-3 minutes, until soft peaks are formed when the whip is lifted. Using a large rubber spatula, fold one-third of the whipped cream mixture into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold the remaining whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Fold the toasted nuts and chocolate chunks into the mousse. ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Line an 8-inch square pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two opposite sides of the pan. Using a long serrated knife, slice the cake horizontally into two layers of equal thickness. Place the top layer, cut side up, in the bottom of the pan. Scrape the mousse onto the cake layer in the pan. Smooth the top with a small metal cake spatula. Place the second layer, cut side down, on top of the mousse. In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the wire whip attachment, combine the heavy cream, Bailey's, and confectioners' sugar and beat on medium-high speed until medium-stiff peaks are formed when the whip is lifted. With a small metal spatula, spread the top of the cake with the whipped cream. Sprinkle the chocolate chunks over the whipped cream. Freeze the cake for 6 hours or overnight. Remove the cake from the freezer. Lift it out of the pan, using the overhanging pieces of foil as handles, and set it on a cutting board to temper for 30 minutes. With a sharp knife, trim the four sides of the cake, then cut into eight 4-inch-by2-inch bars. Serve on dessert plates with warm chocolate sauce.

      <li>6 ounces Peeled and deveined medium shrimp; tail on</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chopped fresh tarragon</li>
      <li>1 pinch Cardamom; optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>THE PLAN: This creamy soup has a tart onion base made of apple, onion and celery. It needs to be stewed long enough to soften the vegetables so that the puree will be very smooth. While it stews, peel and cube the potatoes; boil and drain them. Heat the broth and cook the shrimp; chop and season the shrimp. About 30 minutes before serving, assemble and reheat the soup. You could make the parts of the soup ahead and store in the refrigerator; allow time to return the ingredients to room temperature before assembling. The shrimp will toughen on reheat. NOTE: If you want a silkier base, strain the puree. (30 mins) Finely chop a cored and peeled apple; a peeled and trimmed onion or two, and a celery stalk without leaves. If the celery is stringy, remove strings with a peeler. Melt the butter in a deep skillet, sautepan, or wok and saute the apple, celery, and onions until wilted and starting to color; about 5 to 8 minutes (the finer the chop, the longer it will take). Add the wine and swirl the pan to distribute. Then add the water and the apple juice concentrate; bring to a simmer. Stew until almost all the water has evaporated and the vegetables are very soft, about 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool a few minutes then puree the mixture in a food processor (or blender) until very smooth. Add the ricotta, some of the milk and all the NFDM flakes (or powder) and puree as smooth as possible. Return to the pan and stir in the remaining milk. (20 mins) Stir or whisk into the soup base curry powder, celery seed (or salt) and pepper. Simmer over very low heat, whisking regularly, until reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Add the broth used to cook the shrimp, pouring it through a fine mesh strainer. Mix thoroughly then add the potatoes and simmer for about 4 minutes until the potatoes are hot. Finally stir in the shrimp and tarragon, and simmer for a few minutes. Do not over cook the shrimp. Taste: add cardamom if you want to boost the apple flavor. Serve at once in a wide and shallow bowl to show off the color of the shrimp. POTATOES: (12-15 mins), cover the diced potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Boil slowly for 5-8 minutes, then drain. SHRIMP (10-12 mins): If frozen, let stand in cold water no more than 2 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Heat* the vegetable broth seasoned with old bay just to boiling. Add the shrimp and let stand until just pink. Remove from the broth. Remove the tails and put the tails back in the broth for additional flavor. Quarter the shrimp: slice in half along it's length then cut into bite-sized pieces about the same bulk. Toss the shrimp with the chopped fresh tarragon (to taste) and additional bay seasoning (to aroma). *(stove top or microwave) PARTY MENU IDEA: *Asparagus with Warm Tomato Vinaigrette *Curried Shrimp And Potato Soup *Skillet Pepper Bread *Peppermint Pears with Pecan-Brown Sugar Shortbread *Wine *Coffee Lee's Intro: The shrimp dish that inspired this curried soup was always served over rice. Variations: substitute rice for the potatoes. Add fresh corn off the cob. &gt;from Lee Bailey's Soup Meals (1989:isbn0517573040) &gt;from Kitpath mc-PER SERVING with butter: 417CAL, 10.6G fat (23.2% cff); mc-PER SERVING with spray: 376CAL, 6.0G fat (14.6% cff). &gt;mcCategories : Baileys.Mcf Cream Fish-Shellfish Fruit Rice Soups Eat-Lf Tested &gt;Eat-LF www.reggie.com Archive 1998Feb Recipe by: Lee Bailey's Soup Meals: Warm-Weather / Hanneman Posted to EAT-LF Digest by KitPATh &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; on Feb 06, 1998</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Select dough cycle. When complete, punch dough down by starting bread machine, let stir a few seconds, then stop machine. Place on floured work surface and let rest five minutes. Divide into two balls. Roll each into 10x6 rectangle. Fold dough in half lengthwise, then fold again. Pinch seams together. Place seam side down on baker's peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cut top of loaf with 1/4" deep diagonal slashes at 2" intervals. Cover and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven and baking stone to 450øF. Sprinkle stone with cornmeal. Transfer dough from peel to stone. Bake for 22-28 minutes. Create steam for a crispy crust. NOTE : If using a baking sheet, rather than a baking stone, sprinkle with cornmeal before placing dough on pan, then cover and let rise. This recipe is from THE ULTIMATE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK by Tom Lacalamita. I noticed in an earlier post, a comment about using lemon juice. Many of the recipes in his book call for lemon juice, I think it really makes a difference. I often add it to my recipes. Also, dont' omit the rye flour. Although it's a small amount, the rye lends a wonderful texture to the bread. This is excellent bread...with or without a banneton!

Then freeze as you would normally freeze ice cream, either in an ice cream maker or in a tub in the freezer whisking every half hour or so. Because of the alcohol content of this ice cream it will usually take around 12 hours to become hard. It does freeze hard so taking it out the freezer 10 minutes before serving is advised. It does melt quickly so you have to eat it fast. Don't put any more Baileys into the mix. 1/2 a cup may not seem much but the flavour comes through very strongly. I prefer this with a little Baileys poured over it. Make it and enjoy it. That is an order! Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #256 by Matt &lt;recipes@cableinet.co.uk&gt; on Sep 17, 1997</li>

      <li>Sources: McCalls cookbook and Baileys Irish Cream Bars posted to jewish-food list by B. Leass Baileys Yellow Cake: (Favorite One-Egg Cake recipe from McCalls cookbook, with Baileys substituted for some of the liquid) 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease and flour a 13 x 9 x 2 inch baking pan, and a 6 x 9 x 2 inch pan, or whatever combination of pans that will hold 1 1/2 times the amount that a 13 x 9 x 2 pan holds. 2. Mix the flour with the salt and baking powder. Mix the Baileys with the milk. 3. Using electric mixer, cream the shortening with the sugar. Add the egg and vanilla, and beat well. Add the flour mixture, alternately with the Baileys and milk mixture. Beat for 2 minutes. 4. Pour half of the cake batter into the prepared pans, then drop large spoonfuls of the Baileys Swirl (recipe below) into the pans alternately with large spoonfuls of the cake batter. Swirl with knife or fork to get a marbled effect. 5. Bake about 25-35 minutes, or until surface springs back when lightly pressed with fingertip. 6. Let cool, then spread with Baileys glaze (recipe below). Note: actually the cookbook called for the shortening and milk to be added together to the flour, but that didn't make any sense to me, so I changed it to the method I'm familiar with, where the shortening and sugar are creamed together first. I used butter for the shortening, since that was all I had available. I guess you could use margarine or a solid vegetable fat like Crisco. Baileys Swirl (Cream Cheese Frosting recipe in McCalls cookbook, with Baileys and white chocolate added): 1. With electric mixer, beat cheese with butter and vanilla until creamy 2. Add the confectioners sugar; beat until light and fluffy. 3. Stir in the Baileys and white chocolate, and mix well. Baileys glaze: Mix 3/4 cup Baileys with 1 cup of the powdered sugar. Add more Baileys if the glaze is too thick; add more sugar if the glaze is too thin. Add more Baileys and sugar if there isn't enough glaze. Sorry to be so imprecise, but I didn't really keep track of the amounts while I was doing this, since I had to leave in 15 minutes with the cake! The really fun thing was trying to explain to people what was in the cake! The non-Americans didn't understand the concept of cream cheese frosting at all. It was really hard to explain what frosting is, and I realized this is because over here, either a cake is dusted with powdered sugar (i.e. carrot cake is dusted with powdered sugar here), or it is topped with a thin glaze, or it is "frosted" but with whipped cream or a recipe containing mostly whipped cream. Many of them had never drunk Baileys (which is readily available in supermarkets here)! One woman was positive there was marzipan in the cake! But it was a hit anyway; I had no leftovers to take home! Good thing I still had the smaller cake at home!

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Yeast; (more if you want it to rise faster but the slow rising times are what makes this taste authentic)</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups Flour; (I use King Arthur's Unbleached Bread Flour)</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is better than I can buy in stores. I am told that if you spritz with water while loaves are rising and early in the cooking process that it gets a heavier crust but that's too much work for me. I think it is one I wrote down from Frugal Gormet. I mix the water, yeast, salt, oats and some of the flour in a mixing bowl. Slowly adding more flour until it cleans the bowl and most of the flour is worked in. (I have bread thingys, without them you dump it out earlier and keep working in flour) When it is smooth, oil the bottom of a big bowl, put the dough in and turn so that the oiled surface is on top. Cover with cling wrap or a damp cloth. Let rise for 5 or 6 hours. Form loaves. (Four long, thin ones or 2 long fat ones) I use the supports with holes in them for french loaves. Let them rise again. (don't forget to spritz) Cook at a high heat for 15-20 minutes, depending on loaf size. (don't forget to spritz) I have also used this dough for breadsticks which were a lot of work but impressed the heck out of people. Oh yes, don't cover these loaves with plastic or anything. They dry from the outside in. By day 3 or 4 you need to toast them. Brush with garlic and olive oil and enjoy!

    <title>Baigan Bharta (Mashed Eggplant)</title>
    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <category>Indian</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 medium Eggplants</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cooking the eggplant: Poke the eggplants (say 2, medium sized ones) with a knife, and insert slivers of garlic in the slits. The eggplant can be roasted either in a conv. oven, a microwave, or ideally, on a slow charcoal grill. When they are done (they become kinda' limp), peel, and mash up the insides. Use a knife to cut up the long fibres. Seasoning: In a wok, heat some oil, and add chopped onions, and chopped ginger. Fry till the onions are semi-browned, and then add the mashed eggplant. Add salt, and pepper to taste. Season with lots of chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). Since the eggplant is already cooked, you need not cook for long in the wok... just long enough to mix things up good. A tomato or two chopped fine, and added with the eggplant also tastes good. Alternative sesoning: Chop onions, ginger, tomatoes, and cilantro, and mix *cold* with the mashed eggplant, and a few table spoons of mustard oil. The mustard oil gives a nice tangy taste. Look for mustard oil in your nearest Indian grocery store. (Salt and pepper too.)</li>

      <li>2 cups Water</li>

      <li>1/2 pounds Imported baking chocolate</li>
      <li>4 Whole extra large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Red food coloring</li>
      <li>1 cup Buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Baking soda Chocolate Pecan Frosting----</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Butter</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Imported baking chocolate</li>
      <li>2 pounds Powdered sugar; sifted</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Plus 3 tbsp. cream or milk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Red food coloring</li>
      <li>1 pound Pecans; chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and salt. In a deep saucepan, place the water, butter, oil and baking chocolate. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add chocolate mixture to dry ingredients and mix well on medium speed of mixer until well blended. While still hot, add the eggs, vanilla and red food coloring. Mix at medium speed until well blended. Combine the baking soda and the buttermilk, and add to the batter. Mix at medium speed only until blended. Grease and flour a 2 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 16-inch baking pan. Pour in batter and bake in a 350 oven for 40-45 minutes. Do not overbake. (If desired, the batter can be baked in 2 9x13-inch pans. Reduce baking time slightly.) Pour Chocolate Pecan Frosting over hot cake. Frosting: In a deep saucepan, heat all ingredients, stirring constantly until well blended. Pour hot frosting on hot cake. Cake is good served hot or cold. NOTES : To reduce cost or richness, substitute 8 tablespoons cocoa for the 1/2 pound chocolate in both the cake and frosting. This is one of the most popular cakes ever printed in this paper. The recipe is basically a doubled Texas sheet cake. The original recipe, printed in 1983, called for Moreau chocolate, which is no longer available in Austin or the United States. Callebaut, a Belgian chocolate is a good substitute.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Lee's Intro: Different versions of these little biscuits are served all over the South, using different kinds of cheese, with and without pepper. These wafers can be kept for several weeks in a tightly closed tin. Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Cream the cheese, margarine, butter, salt, and cayenne in a large bowl. Add the flour and mix thoroughly. Roll into a ball and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Divide dough in half, then keep dividing the dough in half until you have 32 small balls. Place them on an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten with the heel of the hand. These do not spread out or rise much during baking, so they can be placed fairly close together. Bake until just golden, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool for just a minute before removing with a spatula to a cooling rack.

      <li>Combine in a small bowl the water, salt, yeast, and sugar. Add the shortening and let proof. Sift the flour into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and gradually add liquid, stirring constantly. Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl. Turn out and knead for 10 minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover with a clean tea towel and let rise about 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down and let rise again for 30 to 45 minutes. Punch down and let rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough onto a floured board and roll into a 15" x 10" oblong. Roll up tightly toward you, beginning with the wide side. With a hand on each end, roll the loaf back and forth to taper the ends and lengthen the loaf. Place diagonally on a greased and cornmeal- sprinkled cookie sheet. Slash at 2" intervals and let rise uncovered for about 1 1/2 hours. Place in a 425 F oven. For the first 15 minutes, spray with a fine mist of water every four minutes. Reduce heat to 350 F and bake 20 minutes longer. The loaf should be golden brown and slide off the sheet easily. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS</li>
      <li>3 cups Semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 cup Vanilla chips OR More chocolate chips*</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Butter</li>
      <li>3 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Bailey's Irish Creme</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped nuts; optional</li>

      <li>4 tablespoons Bailey's Irish Creme</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Bailey's Original Irish Creme gets its flavor from a blend of Irish whiskey and fresh cream, which is delivered daily to the Dublin plant that makes the liqueur. This dessert is packed with chocolate and rich flavor. Using all semisweet chocolate will yield a deeper, darker fudge. FUDGE: Melt all chips with butter until they are soft enough to stir smooth. Do not overheat. Add chocolate/butter mixture to powdered sugar and Baileys. Stir until smooth. Add nuts, if desired. Mix well. Place fudge in an 8-inch square pay sprayed with vegetable spray. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on top and gently press to smooth fudge. TOPPING: Melt chips until smooth. Remove from heat. With a fork, beat in butter and Bailey's until smooth. Spread topping over fudge with a knife. If a very smooth top is desired, use a piece of plastic as done on fudge. Refrigerate until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Can be frozen. Makes 64 pieces.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Someone on r.f.v.c requested a recipe for Baigan Bharta yesterday; here is one from Yamuna Devi's "The Best of Lord Krishna's Cuisine", slightly tweaked, that I make a lot. (also posted on r.f.v.c.) Bake the eggplant 40 minutes at 425F on a baking sheet. Split it and scoop out the pulp; discard the skin. (Some people roast the eggplant over charcoal for a nice flavor). Heat the ghee on medium; add cumin seeds, serranos, and asafetida. Cook until the cumin seeds darken. Add the eggplant, salt, and corriander; cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occassionally. When it thickens, remove from the heat, add the yogurt, cilantro, and garam masala, and serve. (The yogurt might curdle; to prevent that, let the eggplant cool first, then add the yogurt etc, then briefly reheat.)

      <li>Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together and set aside. Cream the butter until soft and gradually add the sugar. Add the flour mixture a little at a time and mix well. Refrigerate for one hour. Divide the dough in half and keep one portion in the refrigerator while rolling out the other to approximately 1/4" thickness. (The dough gets soft quickly.) Sprinkle the dough with the nuts and gently press them in with the rolling pin. Cut into 1-1/2" squares. Pix uses a paper pattern as she is hopeless at estimating things like this, unlike Faith. Prick with a fork and place the squares on an ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Bake until golden brown, approximately 15 minutes in a preheated 350F oven. Makes 6 dozen squares. This is a devostatingly rich, crumbly cookie.

      <li>For crust: Preheat oven to 325=F8F. Lightly butter 9-inch diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Finely grind graham crackers, pecans and sugar in processor. Add butter and blend, using on/off turns. Press crumbs onto bottom and 2 inches up sides of prepared pan. Refrigerate 20 minutes. For filling: Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until smooth. Whisk eggs, Baileys and vanilla in medium bowl until just blended. Beat egg mixture into cream cheese mixture. Finely chop white chocolate in processor using on/off turns. Add to cream cheese mixture. Transfer filling to crust-lined pan. Bake until edges of filling are puffed and dry looking and center is just set, about 50 minutes. Cool on rack. For topping: Mix sour cream and powdered sugar in small bowl. Spread topping onto cooled cake. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 6 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.) Sprinkle grated chocolate over cake. Place pecans around edge and serve. Note: I've fixed the cake with and without the topping, and I prefer it without the topping. As a suggestion, prepare the topping, but serve it on the side.

      <li>Make the milk chocolate layer: Line an 8 inche square pan with plastic wrap leaving an overhang. In a metal bowl, set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt chocolate and whisk until smooth. In another bowl with an electric mixer beat peanut butter with Baileys until smooth. Add the chocolate and the cookies and mix until blended well. Pour into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and chill about two hours or until firm. Make the bittersweet layer: In a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt the chocolate and whisk until smooth. Cool until tepid. In a bowl with an electric mixer, whip cream to soft peaks. Gently fold half of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture and then fold in the remainder. Pour mixture over the firm chilled milk chocolate layer. Spread with a spatula until smooth and bang on work surface to eliminate air bubbles. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 4 to 6 hours or until firm. (This can be prepared several days ahead.) To serve: Remove from refrigerator at least one hour before serving. Lift dessert out of the pan. Cut lengthwise into 1-inch strips using a knife dipped in hot water and dried. Then cut each strip in half crosswise to form two 4 x 1 inch bars. Sieve cocoa powder over the top of the bars. Place 2 bars on 8 plates, resting 1 edge of 1 bar on top of the second bar. Let sit at room temperature about 1 hour before serving.

      <li>1/3 cups Light cream</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Walnut pieces</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Quantity: Makes 3 dozen 1-1/2-inch squares Source: Dear Abby's "More Favorite Recipes" Butter a 9-inch square baking dish. Butter the sides of a heavy 2-quart sauce-pan. Combine sugars, cream, milk and butter in saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugars dissolve and mixture comes to a boil. Cook to soft ball stage (238 degrees on candy thermometer), stirring only if necessary. Immediately remove from heat and cool to lukewarm (110 degrees). DO NOT STIR. Add vanilla and beat vigorously until very thick and mixture starts to lose its gloss. Quickly stir in nuts and spread into prepared baking dish. Score while warm, and cut when firm. Michael's notes: This recipe contains directions (about not over-stirring) that are applicable to most fudge recipes. The buttering the sides of the saucepan is also a life saver in other fudge recipes. Posted to TNT Recipes Digest by Michael Sooter &lt;msooter@llion.org&gt; on May 15, 1998</li>

      <li>follows: Chana dal (or gram dal) are hulled and split chick-peas. Deep yellow in color, these pulses do not need soaking before cooking." "Kabli chana are yellow chick-peas. Unhulled and beige in color, they need overnight soaking before cooking. "Kala chana are small brown or black chick-peas. Like kabli chana, they require long presoaking and cooking to become tender. "Continental masoor are whole greenish-brown lentils. Flat and oval-shaped, they originated in the West and were adopted by India, so they should already be fairly familiar to you. They do not need presoaking." "Masoor are brown Indian lentils. Whole but smaller than continental masoor, they do not require presoaking. "Masoor dal are split masoor which are tiny and salmon-pink because they have also been hulled. They do not need presoaking and turn yellow when they cook. "Moong beans (or hari dal) are dark green, small, and slightly cylindrical in shape. They need 2-4 hours' soaking before cooking, but if oversoaked they will sprout and become moong bean sprouts so familiar in the West." "Moong dal chilka are split moong beans, green on one side and pale on the other. They do not need presoaking. "Moong dal are split, light yellow, and rectangular in shape because they are hulled. They do not need to be soaked before cooking. "Toor dal (or arhar dal) are a hulled, split pulse, a little larger than chana dal. Dull and yellow-colored, they do need presoaking." "Urid (or black matpe) are small, dull, and black, similar in size and shape to moong beans. They must be presoaked. "Urid dal are split urid that do not need to be soaked before cooking. "Washed urid dal are off-white because they have been hulled and washed as well as split. They do not require presoaking." From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>About Shrimp</title>

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>If I may, I'd like to give you some unsolicited advice on handling your shrimp. The better it's treated, the better it's going to taste in the end. 1. Only defrost the quantity you're going to use at any one time (I'm hoping here that the shrimp arrived frozen in manageable blocks. If not, place it in your refrigerator until it's thawed enough to portion, but still icy and essentially frozen. Portion and re-freeze what you're not going to use immediately). 2. Thaw the shrimp in the refrigerator or in a bucket, by running COLD running water over it. If you use the cold water method, allow the water to run over the top of the bucket and into the sink, to ensure a constant supply of fresh water (the temperature of the thawing water should never exceed 70 degrees, and the temperature of the thawed shrimp should never exceed 40 degrees.) If your tap water is hotter, add ice to the thawing shrimp. If the shrimp exceeds 40 degrees, place it in a bath of half ice and half COLD water, and refrigerate until it comes down to below 40. Store thawed shrimp under refrigeration in a mixture of half shrimp, half ice. 3. To peel, devein your shrimp, go to your local seafood market or gadget center, and pick up a nifty little gadget called a "shrimptool". It will cost a couple of dollars, and for the quantity of shrimp we're talking about here, it's worth it. 4. If you want to peel/devein the shrimp for a recipe, keep the unpeeled shrimp on ice as you work with it. Do not let the temperature exceed 40 degrees. Drop your peeled, deveined shrimp into an ice water bath until you're ready to use it. Peeled deveined shrimp may be held this way for up to 24 hours without much loss in flavor/texture. This seems like a lot of trouble, but shrimp begins to lose flavor/texture almost immediately once it gets the least bit warm. Health/safety questions aside, the ice method, while troublesome, results in a MUCH better tasting end product. One other tip -- the iodine in the shrimp will be irritating to your hands, if you handle a large quantity at a time. To avoid this, soak your hands in a strong solution of baking soda and water after working with large amounts. Finally, a quick recipe for fried shrimp that we enjoy: Go to the store and purchase a package of tempura batter mix. Make the mix according to package directions, substituting cold beer (or cold club soda, if you prefer to avoid alcohol) for the water called for in the recipe. Dip butterflied peeled, deveined shrimp in the batter, and fry in hot deep fat until light gold (it won't and shouldn't get deep brown). The leftover batter makes unbelievable onion rings.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I made this in a 1-lb. Panny. For larger loaves, tell Meal Master to change the servings to 3. Spelt is said to have enough gluten to substitute 1/1 for bread flour, but I thought I'd play it safe the first time and mix it with bread flour. It's also cheaper that way. Spelt flour, btw, has 21 grams of protein per cup as opposed to 16 grams per cup of bread flour. It's a nice down-to-earth bread--nothing flashy. Light brown with a chewy crust. It slices easily with my new Slice 'n Easy. Good for sandwiches. Cheers, Margie, NY Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #828 by Nancy Berry &lt;nlberry@prodigy.net&gt; on Oct 06, 1997</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>How to Recognize: The only mulberry native to Canada, it is a short- trunked deciduous tree under 30 feet in height. The bark is reddish brown, separating in long, flaky plates. The yellowish green leaf blades are large, up to 5" long, widest below the middle and have hairy undersides. They are simple with pointed tips and the stems are long with 3 prominent veins at the base of each leaf. Male and female flowers are borne in separate clusters appearing with or before the first leaves. The fruits are dark red to black compact aggregates which resemble blackberries. White mulberry is an Asian tree whose foliage is used for silkworm feed and has been introduced as an ornamental and is an escapee throughout eastern North America. It has lustrous smooth leaves and whitish or reddish fruit. Where to Find: Southernmost Ontario in moist, rich soils often mixed with other hardwoods. How to Use: Harvest easily by spreading sheets under the tree and shaking the branches gently. Juicy and sweet when ripe; delicious raw, in fruit beverages, or in baked desserts. Alone or in combination with acid fruits such as gooseberries or cherries. Can be frozen or dried like raisins. Use as in blackberry and raspberry recipes. WARNING: Be careful not to eat raw fruit before it is ripe. Unripe fruit and the milky sap in the leaves and stems are toxic and can cause gastric upsets. The leaves and stems may also cause dermatitis if touched by susceptible individuals.

      <li>To remove garlic odor from your hands, rinse your hands with fresh lemon juice or scrub with a bit of salt, then rinse with cool water. To freshen your breath after eating garlic, chew on a sprig of fresh parsley. The longer you cook garlic, the milder it becomes. When sauteing garlic, be careful not to burn it. Burned garlic will have a bitter taste, so discard it and start again. To store garlic, keep bulbs in a cool, dry place. Do not refrigerate. Garlic needs air circulation so don't store in a plastic bag. A small wicker basket can keep garlic conveniently and attractively on a kitchen countertop, ready to use. How to buy garlic? Look for garlic bulbs that have plump, firm cloves with the papery outer sheath intact. Avoid garlic that is soft, spongy or shriveled.

      <li>Blueberries freeze very well. Simply sort the fruit, don't wash, and pack in freezer bags or boxes. When you use the frozen fruit, simply wash in running water and use. Don't thaw. This is especially nice when adding blueberries to fruit salad or muffins where you don't want the rest of the product to turn purple. If you've already washed the berries, let them dry before freezing. My favorite way to eat blueberries is "straight up." For breakfast try the berries in rice (brown, white, what ever) with a little cinnamon and/or clove. From: Rita=Schulte%TV%WILL@bigbird.will.uiuc.edu.

      <li>The best resource on Miso that I know of is Shurtleff and Aoyagi's book _The Book of Miso_. It's quite a complex subject. The differences is miso can be attributed to a variet of factors, from the proportion of ingredients, cooking techniques, and duration and temperature of fermentation. The redish color comes from long fermentation times (or in cheap imitations, from dyes). The whiter misos are generally fermented for short times, and often made with rice in addition to soybeans. Reds are generally saltier and whites sweeter. Misos vary widely in fat content (like most soy products) and generally range from .25 to 1.5 gram of fat per tablespoon (and from about 6%CFF to over 30%CFF). Some varieties, like peanut miso, obviously have even more fat. Since it is rare that a dish has more than 1 T miso per serving, miso does not generally add appreciable fat to a dish. Many of the white sweet misos clock in at the low end (.25 grams per T, 6-10%CFF) so if you do want to use more miso, these kinds can be added liberally to a dish (and since their taste isn't as strong or salty, they do become many dishes in greater quantity). I find the dark, hearty misos make great gravy starters. Add a bit of water/stock, some nutritional yeast, spices and a thickener to some miso and voila, instant delicious gravy. A favorite miso-potato recipe follows. ~- Michelle Dick artemis@rahul.net On miso, you just have to try different kinds &amp; brands. There are numerous styles of miso. Red misos tend to be more "savory" and white ones are usually more "sweet". Country-style (Inaka) is made grainier on purpose. If served as a sauce on veggies, probably it's not straight miso but mixed w/sugar and some rice vinegar. BTW a warning to vegetarians, some misos come "dashi-iri" which includes fish-based stock. I think the ingredients label in English will mention fish, but not sure (since I can read the Japanese, I don't usually check the English), so check the ingredients carefully. There is kombu-dashi (I even found some granulated packets) which is vegetarian, but most dashi is from bonito flakes (I guess it must be cheaper). Aiko P.

    <category>Fruits</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The less sugar you use the greater the flavor impact of the fruit. If honey is used there will be a flavor change and the jellies/jams must be cooked longer. If you use artificial sweeteners use only the Cyclamate type to avoid bitterness and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Cooked down jellies in which the juice is extracted by the open kettle method contain 60% fruit versus commercial products [pressure cooked to extract more juice but pectin destroying] with only 45% Jelly: has great clarity from dripping the cooked fruit through a cloth before adding sugar and finishing. Jams, Butter and Pastes: are whole fruit purees of increasing density. Marmalades, Preserves and Conserves: are bits of fruit in a heavy syrup. High Pectin Fruits: Apples, Crabapples, Quinces, Red Currants, Gooseberries, Plums and Cranberries. These need no additional pectin. If you get syrupy jelly you used too much sugar or did not cook the juice long enough after adding the sugar. Low Pectin Fruits: Strawberries, Blueberries, Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, Pears, Blackberries, Raspberries, Grapes, Pineapple and Rhubarb. These require combining with high pectin fruits or adding a commercial pectin. To Test Pectin Content: Put 1 tbl cooled fruit juice in a glass. Add an equal amount of grain alcohol and shake gently. The alcohol will bring the pectin together in a gel. If a large amount of pectin is present it will appear in a single mass or clot when poured from the glass. Use equal amounts of juice and sugar. If the pectin collects in several small particles use have as much sugar as juice. To sterilize jelly glasses: fill jars 3/4 full of water and place them in a shallow pan partly filled with water. Simmer 15 min and then keep hot until filled. If the lids are placed on the steaming jars they will be sterilized simultaneously. Tips: -Use enamel or stainless steel pots not aluminum or copper. -On average, use 3/4 c sugar to 1 c fruit or juice depending on pectin content[see above]. -Very acid fruits can tolerate a whole c of sugar. -Sterilize jars and seal tightly. -For fruit that tends to discolor add lemon juice or Ascorbic acid. -Keep in a cool dark place but do not refrigerate. Making Jam: is easiest and most economical as it needs only one cooking step and uses the pulp. Measure the fruit. In putting it in the pan, crush the lower layers to provide moisture until more is drawn out by cooking or add a little water. Simmer the fruit until it is soft. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Bring to a boil, stirring to avoid sticking. Reduce heat and cook until thickened- up to 1/2 hr. Making Preserves and Conserves: Place fruit in a pot with an equal amount of sugar in layers ending with sugar on top and allow to rest overnight. Bring slowly to a boil and simmer until fruit is translucent. Drain fruit and put in sterile jars. Simmer syrup longer if necessary to thicken it and pour over fruit. Seal and store. Making juice for jelly: Wash and drain fruit. Prick or crush the fruit. Add water if fruit is not juicy enough eg. apples. Add enough to the kettle that you can see it through the fruit but the fruit is not floating. Cook uncovered until the fruit is soft and loosing its color. Have ready a jelly bag [several layers of cheese cloth] . Wet it, wring it out and line a strainer with it. Let the juice drip through without squeezing it as this muddies and flavors the jelly. This juice can be kept up to 6 months before proceeding by freezing or canning it. Making jelly: Measure the strained juice and put it in an enamel or stainless steel pan. Simmer 5 min. Skim off froth. Measure and warm sugar in a pan in the oven and add it. Stir until dissolved. Cook at a gentle simmer until the point of jelling. To test, place a small amount of jelly on a spoon, cool it slightly and let it drop back into the pot from the side of the spoon. As the syrup thickens, 2 large drops will form along the edge of the spoon. when these two drops run together and fall as a single drop the "sheeting" stage has been reached- 220 to 222 deg F and the jelly will be firm when cooled. It can take anywhere from 10 to 30 min for jelly to reach this stage depending on the fruit and the amount of sugar. Take the jars from the sterilizing bath and invert on a cake cooler. They should be hot but dry when filled. Fill to 1/4" from the top. Cover with melted paraffin 1/8" deep.

Rinse and dry lettuce, arugula and radicchio. Discard mushroom stems and slice tops in thin vertical slices. Rinse and dry peas. Remove abalone from shells, using handle of heavy spoon to break muscle attachments. Reserve shells. Clean abalone well, discarding undesirable parts. Clean shells thoroughly, dry and set aside. Using meat slicer, slice abalone muscle crosswise into tissue-thin pieces. If abalone can't be sliced tissue-thin, slice thin as possible and pound each slice on flat surface with mallet or flat end of cleaver until tender and almost transparent but not shredded. Combine juice of 1 lime, 1 tablespoon grated ginger and grind or two of fresh pepper in bowl. Add abalone slices and toss to coat well. Marinate 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Combine remaining lime juice, remaining ginger, vinegar, soy sauce and 3 tablespoons olive oil in small bowl. Tear lettuce, arugula and radicchio into coarse pieces and place in large bowl. Toss with dressing oil. Arrange greens in abalone shells or on serving plates. Set aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet or saute pan, add mushrooms and peas and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir-fry briefly, just until peas turn bright green. Remove from heat and toss to mix well. Pile hot mixture on top of greens in abalone shells. Top with abalone slices. Garnish with lime or lemon wedges, if desired.

      <li>Start with a thoroughly clean coffee maker. Wash after each use with hot, soapy water and rinse well with hot water; never scour with an abrasive pad. When cleaning an automatic coffee maker, follow the manufacturer's directions. Always use fresh coffee and freshly drawn cold water. Never use hot water, especially in automatic coffee makers; it changes percolating time. Serve steaming-hot coffee as soon as possible after brewing. If coffee must stand any length of time, remove grounds and hold coffee at serving temperature over very low heat. Keep ground coffee tightly covered. PREPARATION METHODS Automatic: Follow manufacturer's directions for selecting grind of coffee (special ones are available), measuring and brewing the coffee and holding the coffee at serving temperature. Drip: Measure cold water and heat to boiling. Preheat coffeepot by rinsing with very hot water. Measure drip-grind coffee into filter paper in cone or into filter section of coffee-pot depending on the type of drip pot used. Pour measured fresh boiling water into upper container; cover. When dripping is completed, remove upper container and filter section.

      <li>*Braising is similar to stewing but uses less liquid compared to water-steaming, it develops greater nuances of flavor and preserves more color in vegetables. *Some recipes for braised vegetables call for a combination of cooking methods: Certain ingredients -- usually carrots or other dense-textured vegetables—may be first sauteed in oil or butter to develop color and flavor, then cooked slowly in a small amount of liquid: wine, sherry, vegetable stock, defatted beef or chicken stock, or a combination of these. *The steam-filled atmosphere inside a tightly covered pan or casserole releases the food's essential oils and juices, enhancing the taste and aroma of the vegetables and creating an appetizing glaze. *Any root vegetable -- carrots, onions, leeks, celeriac -- is a candidate for braising; so are celery, cabbage, Belgian endive, fennel and broccoli, or a medley of these vegetables. Swiss chard, kale and mustard braise well if cooked in a very small amount of liquid until barely wilted. TIPS **Start the braising process with about 1/4 cup liquid per 2 cups of vegetables, adding more only if the food cooks dry before it is tender. **Any heatproof casserole with a tight-fighting lid can be used for braising as long as the dish conducts heat well. **Braising can be done on top of the stove or in an oven. **Braising times depend on the variety of vegetables used, their size and shape, their maturity and freshness.

      <li>1 Lemon; juiced</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The Story: The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the main reasons for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling industry. In this area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and it has attributes which allow it to be used everywhere, even in desserts. This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain that the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it moist. The Recipe: Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest, until light. Add the finely grated carrots and the almonds. Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder. Then add the kirsch. Mix or beat until smooth. Beat the egg whites until stiff and carefully fold in. Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the mixture into the tin. Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180 oC. When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin fondant icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.

    <recipetext>
      <li>SS&gt; But I don't even bother buying pork chops any more, I don't want SS&gt; to put leather on the table. :( Don't know if you caught my post to Marlon or not, Sylvia, but the problem is not with you, it's with the pork. Now that pork producers are looking for a leaner, lighter product, pork requires much less cooking than is recommended in most cookbooks. Most cookbook authors recommend cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160-175 to eliminate any possible danger of trichinosis (a problem that's been eliminated in commercially produced pork anyway). These temperatures are WAY too high for the leaner version, which tends to resemble shoe leather if treated this way. Try cooking your chops to an internal temperature of 140 or so instead (still well done, but not overcooked), and you'll have MUCH better results. My favorite thing to do with pork chops is to stuff 'em. Allow one double-thick pork chop or two thinner chops for each person you're feeding. Make a stuffing with cornbread (or one of the cornbread stuffing mixes), chopped onion, chopped celery, a small can of whole kernal corn, a bit of chicken broth. Simmer the onion and celery in the broth until tender, and add the remaining ingredients. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, a generous amount of either sage or thyme. If using double-thick chops, cut a deep pocket in the chop, and insert the stuffing. If using thinner chops, don't stuff yet. Either way, melt a small amount of shortening in a frying pan, and quickly brown the chops (brown thinner chops on one side only). Place the chops in an oven-proof baking dish. (If using thin chops, place one chop, browned side down in the dish, top with a scoop of stuffing, and top with another chop, browned side up). Place just enough liquid in the pan to cover the pan bottom, cover the pan, and bake in a 350 degree oven until the chops reach an internal temperature of 140 (35-60 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat). Any leftover stuffing can be baked separately. I usually make a pan gravy with the drippings from browning the chops, plus some flour and chicken broth (pork stock would be better, but I never seem to have any :-). If you don't want gravy, just deglaze the baking dish with more chicken stock, and spoon this liquid over the chops. Sorry not to offer an official recipe here, but this is one of those home-style dishes that I just throw together. Have never measured anything for it, and I suspect it's never QUITE the same any time I make it. Good stuff, though. At least it's one of Mooseface's favorites :-) Kathy in Bryan, TX From: Kathy Pitts Posted to FIDO Cooking echo by Kathy Pitts from Dec 1, 1994 - Jul 31, 1995.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix together in a bowl all the dry ingredients including dates and walnuts (leave out only the buttermilk, honey, orange half and rhubarb). Put the buttermilk and the honey in the blender. Wash an orange, cut off any price or brand marks and cut it in half. Cut the orange half into chunks and add it to the blender, being sure that you have removed all the seeds. Run the blender until the orange chunks are chopped into little bits. Now add the buttermilk mixture, along with the rhubarb chunks, to the dry ingredients and mix well. Pour immediately into greased cans, filling each can no more than two-thirds full. Cover the filled cans with aluminum foil, and secure the foil with a rubber bands. Place them in a large pot, on some kind of a rack so they are not touching the bottom of the pot. Pour in hot water until the bottom 2 inches of the cans are covered. Bring to a boil and keep the water boiling gently for about 1 1/2 hours. The pot should be covered and there should be a little steam escaping at all times. Check the pot occasionally to make sure that there is enough water left. At the end of 1 1/2 hours, check with a skewer, right through the foil. If it does not come out clean, cook for another half hour and recheck. When the loaves are done, take the "hot" cans out of the pot. When you are ready to serve, uncover a mold, shake the loaf out onto a breadboard and slice it. Serve warm with butter or cream cheese.

      <li>From: kmeade@ids2.idsonline.com (The Meades) Date: Tue, 14 May 1996 13:48:23 -0400 Subject: WHAT DID I DO WRONG? This past Friday I made my first attempt in many years to barbecue a rump roast. I placed it on the spit over medium coals, using a meat thermometer. It roasted for about 2 hours before reaching the medium setting, at which time I removed it from the grill ... When the meat was sliced the center was a nice medium pink. The meat was tough as a piece of shoe leather. What could I have done wrong, or was it just a case of a bad piece of meat to begin with? From: Kathy Pitts: Tough to tell long-distance, Jean, but I'd say the problem was too hot a fire. Rump isn't the tenderest meat in the world to begin with, and if you subject it to too much heat too fast, the connective tissues are going to tighten up, forcing the moisture out, and resulting in a dry, tough hunk of cow. Next time, try roasting the meat in an pan, rather than the rotisserie, building your fire by making SMALL mounds of coals on either side of the roast (no heat directly below). If you like, you can place the roast directly on the grids of your grill, placing the pan in the center of the firebox to act as a buffer for the coals. Place a cover over the roast (if your grill doesn't have a cover, you can improvise one with some heavy wire and heavy-duty aluminum foil.) The heat from the coals should only result in an interior cooking temperature of 250-300 degrees. If it goes down further, don't panic. Anything above 200 will cook the meat eventually, and the slower the better in this case. You also might try using a more acid marinade (wine, beer, lemon or lime juice in the marinade). The acid will tenderize the meat somewhat (don't expect miracles, though). Good luck, and let us all know how the next one turns out. Kathy in Bryan, TX From: Dave Sacerdote: I've found the most common cause of a tough roast isn't the cut of meat or how you cook it, it's how you SLICE it. When you carve, make sure you're cutting across the grain of the meat. With a tied roast, this usually means that you have to change the angle of your cuts as you go along. As for the dryness: I like to slightly undercook a roast when I do it on the grill's rotisserie. The meat continues to cook for a few minutes after coming off the heat, as you know. Letting the roast rest for that time, like you did, usually gives it enough time to "finish off" without drying too much. Remember that when you're rotisserie cooking, the fat side of the roast doesn't baste the meat nearly as much as a standing roast where the fat side stays on top throughout the whole time.

      <li>Although many vitamins and minerals are leached away in the process, pickles remain popular as piquant side dishes and relishes long after more efficient food preservation techniques such as refrigeration, freezing and canning surplanted this pioneer mainstay as a primary food storage method. Short Brine Pickling: In this process the vegetables are soaked in brine 24 hours to draw out moisture but they are not fermented. To keep, they must have boiling hot vinegar poured over them which penetrates and preserves as well as crisping them. The final step after jarring and sealing is a 15 minute boiling water bath to kill any enzymes. If pickles show evidence of fermentation after being stored away [bubbles or leakage] either discard or immediately re-pickle. Because of the acids involved use stoneware, pottery, glass and enamel or stainless steel kettles. For stirring and transferring use a long handled stainless or wooden slotted spoon. Make sure all equipment is clean and grease free. Pickles should be stored in sterilized glass jars with glass lids. For sterilizing techniques, refer to "About Jams, Jellies and Preserves". [Posted by me last week] Fruits and vegetables should be very fresh, in prime condition without blemishes or bruises and scrubbed dirt free. Garlic should be blanched 2 minutes before adding or removed before jarring. Spices should be whole not ground and in a removable spice bag. Water should be low iron, low sulphur and soft. It can be softened with up to 1 tablespoon calcium oxide [lime] per quart. If your water supply is inadequate buy distilled water or collect rain water. Salt should be additive free Pickling salt. Regular table salt will cloud the liquid. Vinegar should be 6% acetic acid. Use white distilled vinegar not cider, wine or flavored vinegars. Lime water or cherry and grape leaves in the liquid will make pickles crisp. Use alum sparingly if at all and do not use the Copper Sulfate called for in old fashioned recipes as it is mildly poisonous in excessive amounts. Pickles should be stored at least 6 weeks to achieve maximum flavor and although they will keep for years should be consumed within one year as the flavor will deteriorate over time. This is based on extracts from the Joy of Cooking with amendments and additions by Jim Weller.

      <li>Place all ingredients except sugar in machine. Program for knead and first rise and press start. The dough will be sticky at first but will hold its shape. After the final cycle, it will be workable. When dough is finished, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and let it rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough to a generous 1/4" thick and cut it into 2" squares. Cover the squares with a clean towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Add the powdered sugar to a medium-size clean paper bag. Lay out paper towels to drain the doughnuts. Heat 1 to 1 1/2 " of oil to 375øF. Do not add too many; add once or it may cool the oil too much. Gently brush the uncooked squares to remove any extra flour. Slide them into the heated oil. When they pop to the surface, spoon the hot oil over them constantly until they are puffed. Turn the squares and cook until they are a light golden color on both sides. It should take 1 to 2 minutes. Cut the first couple of squares in half to be sure there is not sticky uncooked dough inside. Remove from hot oil with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. While warm, drop them, 3 or 4 at a time, into the bag with powdered sugar and shake until they are well coated. Serve immediately.

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mole (pron. mole-a) is a series of Mexican sauces that contain ground chiles, spices, nuts, often chocolate, sometimes raisins, ground seeds, etc. There are three basic types of moles: 1. Mole Poblano (the most famous type, and the one that ALWAYS contains chocolate) was originated in Pueblo during Colonial times (Mexican colonial, not ours) by the nuns who wanted to make a special dish for a visiting Archbishop. The sauce contains ground dried chile peppers, ground nuts, ground raisins, broth, chocolate, sometimes ground corn tortillas, a small amount of sugar, and various spices. It is traditionally served over turkey, with a side dish of unfilled tamales (just the cornmeal masa steamed in corn shucks.) It's one of those dishes that rarely finds its way out of the country of origin, and you either passionately love or passionately hate. I'd post a recipe if I could find one (Have recipes for all three versions floating around SOMEWHERE, but never got the time to enter 'em into the computer, so they're a little tough to find). It may also be purchased pre-made (something I recommend, as the bottled version is excellent, and this is NOT something you'd want to attack from scratch on even a semi-regular basis). If Shirley is interested, I'll pick up a jar and ship it your way. 2. Mole Verde (green mole) contains green chiles, broth, ground pumpkin seeds, various herbs and spices. It's usually served over chicken or pork. Nice stuff, and much easier for the beginner to like than the Mole Poblano. 3. Mole Roja (red mole) is a sauce that contains red chiles, herbs and spices, ground nuts or seeds, ground corn tortillas, usually no chocolate. I THINK it comes from the region around Oxaca. Again, it's marginally easier to like than the more well-known version. It's usually served over chicken or pork. All of these dishes are virtual throwbacks to the complex (and to our palates unusual) combinations of ingredients that were common in that part of the country before the arrival of the Spaniards. None of the dishes is particularly hot, they have a complex, haunting flavor that speaks of cultures long gone, but not entirely forgotten. Don't know if you'd like 'em or not, Unka Burt (I do), but if you want just a hint of what I'm talking about, throw a square of unsweetened chocolate in your next batch of Left-Handed Chili, and let us know what you think.

Add the mascarpone, beating well and then the heavy cream. Put in the refrigerator. Soaking: Mix the coffee, sugar and liqueurs together until sugar is dissolved. Pour half of the mascarpone mixture into a large bowl. Dip 1 ladyfinger at a time into the coffee mixture until thoroughly moistened but not dripping. If you allow the ladyfingers to absorb too much of the coffee mixture, they will exude their liquid into the cream layer and the cream will be watery. Cover the entire surface of the cream layer with the dipped ladyfingers. Pour the remaining mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, smoothing with a spatula. Chop some bittersweet chocolate into medium/small chunks and sprinkle over the top of the dessert. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, overnight is best. Serve cold.

Take care and have a great weekend!!! 1. Dissolve the sugar in the hot water. 2. Add the root beer concentrate and let cool. 3. Combine the root beer mixture with the cold seltzer water, drink immediately, or store in fridge in tightly covered container. The root beer you'll make here is a simplified version of Roy Allen's method from the early 1900's. Instead of harvesting roots, herbs, and berries, you have the luxury of using a root beer concentrate that can be found in most grocery stores. In 1922 Allen expanded his business, he formed a partnership with entrepreneur Frank Wright. This led to the name that would become famous, A&amp;W, the country's best-selling root beer.

    <recipetext>
      <li>The tea you buy is a delicate blend of some 20 to 30 varieties. Quality varies according to the soil, climate and altitude in which it is grown and the age and size of the leaves when they are picked. Broadly classified, there are three types: black, oolong and green. Black tea derives its color from a special processing treatment in which the leaves are allowed to oxidize. This turns the leaves black and produces a rich brew. Oolong tea is semioxidized. Its leaves are brown and green. It brews light in color. Green tea is not oxidized, thus the leaves remain green. The brew is pale green in color. PREPARATION METHOD Whether you use loose tea or tea bags, the preparation method is the same: Start with a spotlessly clean teapot made of glass, china or earthenware. Add rapidly boiling water; allow to stand a few minutes, then pour out. Heat cold water to a full rolling boil. Add tea or bags to the warm pot, allowing 1 teaspoon of loose tea or 1 tea bag for each cup of tea desired. Pour boiling water over tea (3/4 cup for each cup of tea); let stand 3 to 5 minutes to bring out the full flavor. Stir the tea once to ensure uniform strength. Do not judge the strength of tea by its color; You must taste it. Strain the tea or remove tea bags. Serve with sugar and milk or lemon if desired. Prepare instant tea, a concentrate, according to the directions on the jar. Source: Betty Crocker's Cookbook, 6th Edition From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>As their name suggests, quick breads are just that-fast and very easy to make. Quick breads range from pancakes to tender, flaky biscuits to moist, rich nut breads. Quick-acting baking powder rather than slower-acting yeast is the leavening agent for quick breads. It consists of an acid, such as cream of tartar, and an alkali, such as baking soda, which react with one another in the presence of moisture to form a gas. In batter or dough this gas forms tiny bubbles that expand quickly, creating the structure of the quick bread. To be sure it is always fresh, purchase only a small quantity of baking powder at a time. BAKING TIPS Use shiny pans and cookie sheets, which reflect heat, for golden, delicate and tender crusts on muffins, coffee cakes and nut breads. Grease only the bottoms of muffin cups; muffins will then be nicely shaped and have no rim around the top edge. Grease only the bottoms of loafpans for fruit or nut breads. The ungreased sides provide a surface for the batter to cling to while rising during baking, which helps form a gently rounded top. Cool nut breads completely before slicing to prevent crumbling. Cut with a sharp, thin-bladed knife, using a light sawing motion. Source: Betty Crocker's Cookbook, 6th Edition From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Unopened buds are delicious when cooked but must be treated first to remove bitterness. Put them in a pot, pour on boiling water, boil one minute, drain, and pour on more boiling water. Repeat this process three times or until no bitterness remains when you taste them. Cook them a little longer until just tender and serve with butter. Reader Jean McLain of Peoria, IL wrote "The Herb Companion" and asked: "Any ideas what can be done to use milkweed blossoms? The fragrance is musky but not unpleasant. Could they be used in moth-repellant bags?" HC responded with the above recipe and said they could find no mention of any use of the blossoms as a moth repellent.

    <recipetext>
      <li>I like to add the Mexicorn and bacon to this recipe. It certainly does enhance the flavor, but if you want plain corn muffins, you can certainly omit these 2 ingredients. Preheat oven to 400~. You'll need either one or two 12 unit muffin tins, lined with cupcake papers. Whisk the dry ingredients together, throughly, in a bowl and set aside. Whisk the sour cream, eggs amd melted butter together until well-blended. Make a well in the dry ingredients, pour in cream/butter/egg mixture and if you're adding the corn and bacon, add them now. Using a spatula, fold the ingredients together, just until combined--DON'T OVERMIX. Spoon the mixture into the lined muffin tins, filling them evenly, about 3/4 full. Bake for 20-25 minutes, testing until a wooden pick comes out clean. Let me know if these muffins are what you're looking for. I have more recipes if they're not.

      <li>Great care must be taken in canning to avoid spoilage. Non-acid foods require special care to avoid deadly botulism and require pressure cooking not just a boiling water bath. Check the elasticity of the sealing rubbers and discard cracked ones. Do not re-use old ones. Wash them in soap and hot water, rinse and place in a pan covering them with boiling water. Leave them soaking in the hot water until used. Check the jars for cracks and chips. Test the jars by filling with water and inverting; watch for leaks. Sterilize for 15 minutes in boiling water. Can only fresh, unblemished produce. Wash well to remove all dirt. Many foods require blanching to partially cook them and kill enzymes. Immerse in boiling water for 5 minutes, then plunge into cold water to arrest cooking. Tomatoes, berries and soft fruit do not need blanching. Meats should be 2/3 cooked by simmering or roasting. Add salt in the ratio of 1 tsp per quart for meats and vegetables Use a sugar syrup for fruits and add lemon juice or ascorbic acid to avoid discoloration. See "About Jams, jellies and preserves" Pack jars tightly to 1/2" from the top but do not crush the contents. Exception: peas, lima beans and corn need more room to expand; fill to 1" from the top and add boiling water to the 1/2" mark. Stir the contents to release trapped air bubbles before sealing the jars. Wet the rubber before using. Follow the manufacture's instructions that come with the pressure canner and add 1/2 lb pressure per 1000' in high altitudes. Use a boiling water bath only for tomatoes, acid fruits and brined vegetables. Use a rack to keep the jars off the bottom where they can overheat and crack. The water should be at least an inch over the jars at all times. Add 1 minute per 1000' feet for high altitudes. Store the finished product in a cool dark pantry or cellar. Berries, cherries and currants: Pack jars with washed, stemmed fruit and fill the jars with boiling medium syrup [3 cups sugar to 4 cups water brought slowly to a boil while stirring]. Process 15 minutes in a boiling water bath. [Cherries should either be pitted OR have their skins pierced with a pin if canned whole]. Peaches: Scald to loosen skins. Peel and half, removing pits. Use medium syrup and process 20 min. in boiling water bath. Tomatoes: Scald and dip in cold water before skinning. Cut out cores but leave whole. Pack and fill jars with boiling water.

    <title>About Grouper From Great Fish, Quick By Leslie Revsin</title>
    <category>Seafood</category>
    <category>Basics</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Whole grouper fillet</li>
      <li>259 grams Grouper</li>
      <li>9 ounces Grouper; approximately</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"Quick" is the operative word: Most of the recipes for grouper take 45 minutes or less to prepare. Grouper can be grilled, sauteed, fried, stir-fried, broiled, roasted or baked, says the author. It's a white-fleshed fish, mild, moist and slightly sweet - just the kind of not-too-fishy fish that can win over people who shy away from more strongly flavored types. Grouper is found in temperate waters from the Mid-Atlantic through the Gulf of Mexico. Lowcountry fishermen have been catching grouper offshore recently, but you can find it on land, too - if not in your grocery store, then at a seafood shop. Revsin says good grouper will have firm, somewhat satiny flesh, translucent white to pale pink color, and with "a clean, ocean aroma." Avoid fish with flesh that's bruised, discoloring, soft or mushy, as well as fish that smells like ammonia, she says. The thickness of the fillets is important: They should be no more than 3/4 inch to 1 inch thick, says Revsin. When she was a restaurant chef in New York, she often got fillets that were more than 1 inch thick, and she noticed then that the edges curled up as they cooked. "If you see fillets that are more than 3/4 inch in thickness, they've been cut from a very large fish, and when cooked they usually become coarse and tough," she says. "They may be fine for a slow-braised fish dinner, but they'll turn on you if you approach them with short-cooking methods." Sauteed, grilled or quickly broiled, thick fillets can turn into gnarled, twisted shapes, says Revsin. "That satisfying chewiness, which I like, turns into a rubberiness, which I don't like," she says. *Chef Leslie Revsin, from Bronxville, NY. Worked restaurants in New York. Latest book has recipes for grouper and all her other fish favorites, "Great Fish, Quick" (Doubleday, $27.50). * Revsin was the first female chef at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. She opened her own place, Restaurant Leslie, in 1977, and since then has served as executive chef at the Bridge Cafe, One Fifth Avenue and Argenteuil in New York City. She also has been a chef at the Inn at Pound Ridge in Westchester, N.Y. see: Broiled Grouper With Grain Mustard-Pineapple Vinaigrette; Grilled Grouper With Ancho Chile Butter; Sauteed Grouper With Spicy Black Beans; Sauteed Grouper With Tropical Fruit Salsa.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The following four recipes are from a Chron article called "Foreign Intrigue" by Alice Cuneo that featured recipes from various consulates in the City. This first one is from the Consulate of the People's Republic of China. It's a sophisticated (but uncomplicated) banquet dish featuring abalone, shrimp and porkfat. Abalone stuffed with minced shrimp, from Shen Xuliang of the Chinese consulate. Trim the abalone, removing rough parts, and cut into flat rounds. Chop shrimp and fat pork to a paste consistency; stir in the water chestnuts, chives and ginger water. Season with salt and MSG. Create the abalone "sandwiches" by spreading an abalone round with shrimp paste, then topping with another round. Dredge "sandwiches" in maize flour and set aside. Heat chive and ginger oil in a wok over medium heat, swirling the oil to coat all sides of the wok. Dip the abalone "sandwiches" in the flour, then in eggs. Fry in the hot oil until abalone is tender and golden. Add Shaoxing wine, chicken stock, salt and MSG. Bring to a simmer, adjust the seasonings and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately. NOTE: Chive and ginger oil is oil in which chives and ginger have been cooked. To make at home, heat 4 ounces oil in a wok set over medium heat. Toss in 1 or 2 tablespoons fresh snipped chives and 3 slices fresh ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, then proceed with recipe. (Remove ginger slices before serving.) Ginger water is available in Chinese markets. From the San Francisco Chronicle, 6/15/88. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cberg2.zip</li>

Here is what I did; you may need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!! * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the microwave) Place ingredients. in the B/M according to your manufacturers' directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let me know your results, we sure enjoyed it!

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>SERVES 4-6 When the local asparagus season starts in Seattle, the Pike Place Farmer's Market goes crazy. Asparagus is everywhere and we eat ourselves into an asparagus frenzy. This quick dish is very tasty. Remember, don't overcook the asparagus. It should be bright green and a bit crunchy. Cut the spears into 1-inch-long pieces and set aside. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Throw in the asparagus and cook for 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water immediately. This can be done up to an hour before dinner if you wish. Keep the blanched asparagus in cold water. Heat a large frying pan and add the remaining olive oil and garlic. Add the drained asparagus and cook only until it is hot. Remove from the pan to a serving dish. Add the butter and sliced almonds to the pan. Stir about until the almonds are toasty brown. Add the lemon juice and immediately pour the sauce over the asparagus. Serve right away. HINT: ON CLEANING ASPARAGUS. Some people go to the work of peeling the ends of the asparagus shoots. I do not bother. Hold the spear in both hands and break it off at the most tender point of the bottom of the stem. Just bend it and it will break where it should. The top part is for dinner and the bottom part is to be saved for asparagus soup. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>The Chinese were enjoying noodles and pasta 5,000 years before the birth of Christ. During the same time, Europe was in the Stone Age, the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome would not exist for another 3,000 years and in the Americas, only tall grasses grew where much of the wheat used to make pasta noodles is now produced. Today, pasta is a definitive convenience food that offers great variety, easy-preparation and high-quality nutrition. Try this Pasta Great for dinner tonight, and you'll appreciate the history of the noodle all the more! Wash and thoroughly dry asparagus. Place stalks in a baking pan large enough to hold them in one layer, and gently rub them with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt over the asparagus and bake in a pre-heated 425-F degree oven for 12 to 15-minutes, depending upon the thickness of the stalks. Remove from oven and set aside. When cool enough to handle, cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Fill a large pasta pot with a generous amount of salted water and cook the Fettuccine until al dente. Drain, place in a bowl and toss with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Pour wine into a large skillet or pan. Add shallots and reduce over medium heat to one half the original volume. Wash lemons well with soap and water to remove wax, rinse and dry. Add grated rind and juice from 2 lemons to the wine. Simmer another 2-minutes. Add cream to mixture and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and add 1/3 cup cheese, 1/4 teaspoon salt and cayenne pepper. Simmer slowly, whisking constantly, for approximately 4-minutes, or until sauce begins to thicken. Cut cold butter into small pieces and add to the sauce, cooking another minute. Add asparagus pieces, pasta and 2 tablespoons cheese. Toss until pasta is thoroughly coated with sauce and heated through. Divide pasta evenly in heated plates or soup bowls. Sprinkle with grated peel from remaining lemon, chives and mint and serve.

Cook over med heat until asparguas is crisply tender (5-7 min.) Drain, return to skillet. Add remaining ingreds. pushing asparagus to side just until the butter is melted. Cook over med. heat stirring occasionly until heated through (5-7 min). One thing I do is combine all the ingred. in a small dish while the asparagus is cooking then put it the skillet.

      <li>1 Red onion, chopped</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Steam the asparagus pieces for 2 minutes. Plunge into cold water to stop cooking. Drain. Put asparagus, red pepper and onion into a plastic bowl (with cover). Blend vinegar, water, sugar (honey) and parsley in a separate bowl and then pour over vegetables. Adjust seasonings if desired (may want to add more sweetness). Stir, cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Stir every so often. Serve cold as a side salad. Hint: make sure you only use the tender part of the asparagus. My mom taught me that you hold the tip and base of the asparagus in separate hands and then bend it until it breaks. Only use the tip end and use the base end for soup or compost it.

      <li>2 teaspoons Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chives; minced</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Blue cheese; crumbled</li>
      <li>White pepper; freshly ground</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Snap ends off asparagus spears. Fill medium skillet with 1-inch water and bring to a boil. Add asparagus in single layer and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until tender. Drain well and arrange on a serving plate. Stir together vinegar and oil in sm bowl. Add blue cheese and chives and mix well. Pour over hot asparagus. Season to taste with plenty of white pepper. Set aside until tepid, then serve. Hint on cleaning asparagus: Hold the bottom end of the stem in one hand and gently bend the stalk with the other. The stalk will break where it is tender, thus giving you a piece of asparagus that is entirely edible. With a little practice you will know exactly where to break the vegetable. Save the broken-off ends for soups. Slice and add to soup stock, then drain and discard the coarse stalks before serving.

      <li>12 Medium-size asparagus</li>
      <li>4 Pieces pickled red ginger</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: DRESSING</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Thin soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ginger juice</li>
      <li>1 pinch Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sesame oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Asparagus salad is typical of many Chinese vegetable salads, in that the vegetable is first steamed, then cooled, before slicing and dressing. Wash asparagus spears. Use sharp paring knife to peel off tough white skin on lower stem and cut off the very end. When steamer is hot, steam spears until barely cooked. They are overcooked when the color is olive. Remove from steamer, drain any water, and cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, mix dressing ingredients in small bowl. Slice pickled red ginger into thin slivers. About ten minutes before serving, slice spears on the bias into 2" segments. Place on serving dish, intermingled with pickled ginger. Pour dressing over asparagus, and let it permeate the salad. Serve at room temperature. This salad can also be served while asparagus is still warm, or it can be chilled. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 pounds Asparagus, trimmed, peeled and cut (1 inch pieces)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1 quart Chicken broth</li>
      <li>4 Eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
      <li>6 slices Italian bread, toasted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oil and garlic in a soup pot until the garlic is golden. Add the asparagus and cook until they begin to color. Season with salt and pepper. Add the broth and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender. Beat the eggs and cheese together. When the asparagus is tender, reduce the heat so the soup is no longer simmering. Very slowly ladle some of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, stirring continuously. After adding about 2 cups of the hot soup to the eggs, reverse the process and gradually stir the eggs mixture into the soup pot. The soup must not boil or the eggs will scramble. Heat until thickened. Put one slice of toasted bread into each soup dish. Ladle the hot soup on top and pass additional grated cheese. Serves 6. NOTE: To trim asparagus, hold the tip in one hand and the base of the stalk in the other. Bend gently. The asparagus will snap, leaving the tender part with the tip.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Look for "small new potatoes" with purple-red skins, and fewer deep eyes. Boil rinsed potatoes in plenty of lightly salted water, about 15 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and set aside. Cut the asparagus and carrots to size before cooking. Steam each vegetable separately (a dente). -Asparagus (1-1/2 to 2-inch lengths) 1-2 minutes. -Carrots (1/4-1/3-inch thick) 5 minutes. Put the vegetables in a bowl and chill: to stop cooking and to cool the potatoes enough so that they can be handled without crumbling. Slice the red potatoes 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Prepare the dressing in a blender, food processor, or hand-held grinder. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Drizzle on the salad and toss gently to coat. Fold in the tender shallot (or scallions; spring-green onions, sweet onion). Cover and chill (about 2 hours). Lettuce (optional). Cooksnote - substitute fresh rosemary for the basil. Use fresh herbs Published by Wisconsin Trails Magazine (1988). NOTES : Here's an eye-appealing potato salad from Wisconsin. Asparagus is grown there.</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>These wonderful little make-ahead hors d'oeuvres are a treat to assemble in the spring when asparagus hits the market. You can store them in your freezer for a time later in the year when the taste would really hit the spot. Blanch asparagus spears until barely tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain immediately and plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process. Remove crusts from bread and flatten slices with a rolling pin. In a medium bowl, combine cheeses and egg, blending with an electric beater. Spread mixture evenly over bread slices. Trim asparagus spears to same length as bread slices, and then place one spear on each slice and roll up, jelly roll fashion. Dip each roll in melted butter to coat all sides, and place on a cookie sheet. Freeze rolls until hard, then re-package in freezer-storage containers. When ready to bake, cut frozen rolls into thirds and bake (while still frozen) in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve immediately. Yields 75 pieces.

      <li>1 pound Asparagus</li>
      <li>1 cup Fish paste</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Thai-style chile paste'</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Fish Paste: Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and reduce to a paste. It should have the consistency of cookie dough. If it is not dry enough, add more cornstarch. Asparagus: Heat the oil to medium in a wok or other deep, heavy vessel. Take 3 or 4 asparagus spears in one hand and about 2 or 3 tablespoons of fish paste in the other. Wrap the fish paste around the middle of the sheave to bind it together. Drop it into the hot oil and deep fry for about 3 minutes, or until the fish paste is set and just beginning to brown. Remove and drain. Repeat, cooking three or four sheaves at a time. Combine the remaining fish sauce and chile paste and drizzle over the cooked sheaves. Variation: To reduce calories, cook the sheaves in boiling clarified chicken or fish stock. You could also use green beans, or bell peppers cut into thin strips lengthwise.

      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Wed, 1 May 1996 06:05:05 GMT From: Anne Sheresky &lt;sheresky@worldchat.com&gt; Break off tough stems from asparagus and discard. Peel lower half of asparagus stems; cut into 1-inch lengths. In saucepan of boiling salted water, cook asparagus for about 10-minutes or until tender; drain. In food processor or blender, process until smooth. There should be about 2 cups puree. Transfer to saucepan. Add mayonnaise, lemon juice and onion; cook over low heat just until warmed through. Meanwhile, in small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water; let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Over low heat, warm gelatin until disolved; stir into asparagus mixture. Transfer to bowl and place in large bowl of ice and water to chill, stirring frequently, for 10 to 15 minutes or until cold and slightly thickened. Remove from iced water. Whip cream; set aside. In large bowl, beat egg whites with salt until stiff peaks form. Whisk about one-quarter of the beaten egg whites into cooled asparagus mixture; fold into remaining whites along with whipped cream. Pour into rinsed 6-cup mould. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 2 days. To unmould, wrap hot damp tea towel around mould for 1 minute. Using knife, loosen top edge of mousse from mould. Tilt or gently shake mould= to loosen mousse. Invert rinsed serving platter on top of mould. Grasp platter and mould; quickly turn over. Shake using quick downward motion, to release mousse from mould. Lift off mould. (If mousse sticks, repeat the procedure.)

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Saute onion, leek and garlic for 3 minutes. Add rice and pepper and saute for 5 minutes more. In a separate pot, heat vegetable broth to nearly boiling, then remove from heat. Add 7 cups broth and sundried tomatoes to rice mixture. Reserve remaining 1 cup broth. Bring rice mixture to a boil and reduce heat to a lively simmer for 12 minutes, stirring often. Meanwhile, after 10 minutes, combine reserved cup of broth, asparagus, mushrooms and basil in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover loosely with plastic and heat in microwave on high for 1 1/2 minutes, until hot but not completely cooked. Add mixture to simmering rice, mix well and simmer about 5 minutes more, until mixture is creamy and rice is just done. Helpful hint: If you don't have a microwave, steam asparagus, mushrooms and basil for 5 minutes, until asparagus is tender-crisp. Add to the mixture along with remaining 1 cup vegetable broth. Continue cooking and stirring until mixture is creamy and rice is done. This was the second place winner in Vegetarian Times' recipe contest.

      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cider Vinegar</li>
      <li>Salt And Pepper To Taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash asparagus under cold running water. Snap off lower end of each stalk with your fingers. Let the stalk break where it wants to, this will leave only the tender portion of the stalk. Young tender asparagus can be cooked in a steamer for 5-7 minutes, the more mature stalks for 7-10 minutes. Do not over cook asparagus, it will lose flavor and nutrients if over cooked. At the same time, place the hazelnuts and butter in a small heavy skillet. Heat until the butter melts and mix thoroughly. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour hazelnut butter over hot asparagus. Serve at once. From: Syd's Cookbook. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/sydsbook.zip</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash the asparagus and snap off the white ends. Set aside all tops and half that number of ends. Plunge the tops into a large pot of salted, boiling water and cook until limp but not for too long. (Note: Cook slightly longer than for eating. If undercooked, they will not process well; if overcooked, they will taste earthy.) Drain the asparagus thoroughly and, while still hot, run it through food processor with unsalted butter for 3 - 4 minutes until smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor frequently. Meanwhile, chop asparagus ends to remove the dry hard field cuts and simmer with cream. Cook the ends slowly for 20 minutes, then strain, pressing through gently. Just before serving, combine asparagus, butter and cream. Heat slowly to just below boiling point. Adjust the seasonings to taste.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cook pasta according to instructions. Add asparagus for the last 2 1/2 minutes of boiling (not longer than this or it will be too soft). Drain and rinse with cold water. Add tomatoes and onions. Chill. Combine the remaining ingredients, and pour over salad when ready to serve. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. [Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top.] Yumm! this served 10 at dinner with leftovers, (but it was not the main dish). I can also imagine it with small cubes of mozzarella cheese instead of (or in addtion to) parmesan, or with dill instead of basil.

      <li>&gt;From Muffins A to Z by Marie Simmons These tender, creamy and delicious savory muffins are great for breakfast or for lunch or supper, served with soup and a salad. They are even good without the bacon. 1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter 12 muffin cups or coat with nonstick cooking spray. 2. Cook the bacon in a skillet until crisp. Drain on a paper towel; cool. cut into 1/4-inch pieces; set aside. 3. Combine the flour,c ornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl; stir until well blended. Add the bacon. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, corn, oil and egg until blended. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry all at once and fold just until evenly moistened. Do not overmix. 4. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Bake until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before removing from the pan. Makes 12 medium muffins Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #218 by Sandra Swinford &lt;sswinfor@cecasun.utc.edu&gt; on Sep 4, 1997</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 slices Bacon</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Lean ground chuck or ground round</li>
      <li>1 cup Firm fresh white bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup Coarsely shredded sharp cheddar cheese; (about 4 ounces)</li>
      <li>1 large Sweet onion; such as vidalia, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Regular or low fat mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons India or other sweet pickle relish</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dry mustard</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Ketchup</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until it is limp and some of the fat is rendered, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bacon from the skillet and reserve. In a large mixing bowl, use your hands to gently but thoroughly mix together the meat, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the cheese, onion, mayonnaise, relish, mustard, salt, pepper, and egg. Pat the mixture into a shallow 2 quart baking pan. Spread the top of the loaf with ketchup, then lay the bacon strips over the ketchup. Bake until the loaf is firm and the bacon is crisp, 45 to 50 minutes, sprinkling the top of the loaf with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese to melt during the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Internal temperature should be 155 degrees. Let the meatloaf stand in the baking dish for 10 minutes, then cut into squares to serve. For leftovers, reheat slices in a microwave and serve on sesame buns with lettuce, tomato and ketchup.

      <li>Break up the lumps in the cold rice with your hand; set aside. Prepare other ingredients before cooking. Mix the soy sauce and wine in a small dish. Fry the bacon in a wok on high heat until nearly crisp. Remove most of the fat, leaving ~2 tbsp or less. Add the onions and fry with bacon until soft and golden. Push the bacon/onions to the side and scramble the eggs in the fat at the bottom of the wok. Add the rice and mix everything together until rice is hot. Sprinkle with soy sauce/wine and pepper and stir to mix. Note: I like how this works with long-grain better than short-grain rice.

Crumble bacon, reserving 4 or 5 strips for the top of dish. Saute onion in remaining drippings. Add cheese soup, milk, Wrocestershire sauce and mustard; mix well and heat through. Stir in the bacon, macaroni, shredded cheese and pimiento. Place in casserole dish (I use 3 quart). Top with remaining strips of bacon. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 minutes. Enjoy!!

      <li>1/4 cups Onion; finely minced</li>
      <li>4 slices Crisply cooked bacon; finely minced</li>
      <li>(reserve 2 tablespoons of bacon fat)</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups Flour</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a skillet, cook the onion in the reserved fat over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened; let mixture cool. In a small bowl combine the onion mixture with the finely minced (do this in a food processor) bacon; season with freshly ground pepper. Into a bowl, sift together the flour, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the salt. Add the shortening and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Stir in the bacon mixture and the Cheddar; add the milk and stir the mixture until it just forms a soft sticky dough. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto a buttered baking sheet. Bake the biscuits in the middle of a preheated 425 oven for 15 to 17 or until pale golden brown. Makes about 16 biscuits.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Bacon</li>
      <li>1 pound Fresh mushrooms, washed</li>
      <li>Toothpicks</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Cut the mushrooms in half. If it is a very small mushroom, leave it whole. If it is an oversized mushroom, cut into thirds or fourths. 2. Slice bacon in half (width-wise) at an angle. To do this, hold the knife perpendicular to the bacon, then turn the knife slightly so that the knife is now at an angle, then slice the bacon. 3. Take a slice of bacon and wrap it around a mushroom half, overlap the ends, and poke a toothpick about half-way into the mushroom at the overlap. 4. Repeat this for each bacon slice and mushroom half. 5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 6. Arrange mushrooms on a drip pan about 1/2-inch apart. Bake for 20 minutes. Serve hot. NOTES: Depending on how thick the bacon is, you may need more than 1 pound. Also, don't let soak mushrooms in water or they'll absorb too much water and then they'll shrink and crack.

      <li>*I would add shredded cheese to the original recipe instead of as an option. Fry and crumble bacon. Preheat oven to 450. Mix all ingredients. Form in small balls on ungreased cookie sheet. Brush with beaten egg or milk. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until golden. Sylvia's comments: I'm not sure where I got this recipe, but it was easy and quite good, and I bet just about anything could be substituted for the bacon/bell pepper/onions. I used oregano and shredded cheddar in one batch, and dried salad toppings in another, and they all came out fine. I also dropped tablespoonsful onto a cookie sheet rather than forming them in small balls and skipped the "brush with beaten egg" part Recipe By : File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash the joint to remove surface blood. Put the meat into a large clean pan and cover well with water. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down, cover with lid and simmer for 2 hours. Top up if the water sinks below the level of the meat - at the end of the cooking you should have 2 pints of liquor. Leave it to cool, meat and all, and lift off the white hat of grease (it makes good dripping after heating gently to drive off the water). Some families like the fat left in. Prepare the vegetables - scrub, peel and cut them into bite-sized chunks as appropriate. Wash and slice the leeks into 1/2-inch rings. Then make the sauces. For the MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE: Melt 1 oz butter in a small pan. When it froths, sprinkle in the flour and fry for a moment until mixture is sandy. Stir in the mustard powder and tumeric and immediately whisk in the broth and milk. Whisk till the mixture thickens. Chop the egg and stir in. Finish with the vinegar and beat in the extra ounce of butter. Taste and add salt and pepper. For the SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP: Chop the tomatoes, skin and chop the onion. Put all the ingredients except the optional chili into a lidded saucepan. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat, leave to simmer gently for 30 minutes. Push the contents of the pan and boil it fiercely for a few minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve either hot or cold. Finish with a few slices of deseeded chili if you like it hot. For the PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a small pan, stir in the flour and let it cool for a moment. Whisk in the liquid gradually and stir over the heat until the mixture thickens. Mix in the herbs, taste and add salt and pepper. Reheat the meat in its broth (the cawl). Remove the meat and keep it warm while you cook the root vegetables in the broth. Five minutes before you are ready to serve, add the leeks. While the vegetables simmer, plain-boil the potatoes separately. Stir the chopped parsley into the soup just before you bring it to table. As a second course, serve the meat with the potatoes, and the three sauces. Source: Elisabeth Luard in "Country Living" (British), April 1989.

Roast capon 25 minutes or until golden brown. Loosely cover capon with aluminum foi. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and roast capon 2 1/2 to 3 hours longer or until meat thermometer inserted into inner thigh registers 180°F. Transfer capon to large serving platter. To make sauce, remove wire rack and all fat from drippings in roasting pan. Pour in chicken broth and heat to boiling over high heat.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Reserve bacon drippings, if desired. Drain cooked bacon on paper towels. Crumble and set aside. Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners; set aside. Preheat oven to 400~F. In a large bowl, sitr together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar. Stir in cheese; set aside. In a medium bowl, beat egg. Stir in sourdough starter, milk and oil or drippings. Add to flour mixture. Stir with fork until dry ingredients are just moistened. Fold in crumbled bacon. Fill prepared muffin cups 2/3 to 3/4 full with batter. Bake in preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from muffin cups. Serve hot. Great for breakfast with a glass of orange juice! These turned out absolutely WONDERFUL. I would suggest greasing the muffin tins very well. The cheese tends to make them stick a little!

      <li>Honey mustard</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 2. Separate the bacon slices. Place the brown sugar in a shallow bowl. Spread one side of each bacon slice with a thin layer of honey mustard. Dip both sides of each bacon slice in the brown sugar to coat thoroughly. 3. Place the bacon on a rack over a pan to catch the drippings. (If smaller hors d’ oeurves are desired, cut the slices into halves or thirds&gt;0 4. Bake in the upper third of the oven for 20 minutes. Finish browning the bacon under the broiler, watching closely. 5. Let cool slightly but not too long or the bacon will stick to the rack. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve at room temperature. NOTE: The bacon can be made in advance and refrigerated, but it must be reheated to melt the chilled fat and then cooled to room temperature before cooking.

      <li>1 Recipe "Corn Bread"</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>SERVES 6 Bacon was one meat that would keep fairly well during the long trip on the trail, providing you kept it in bags surrounded by bran. The bran would help prevent the bacon fat from melting under the heat of the prairie sun. This dish offers a new flavor, which must have been truly delicious after a day in that wagon! Cook the bacon until crisp. Reserve the fat. Chop the bacon and stir it into the corn bread batter. Use bacon fat instead of shortening, if you wish, to make the batter. Grease the pan with a good bit of the bacon fat and bake the corn bread as directed. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>4 ounces *each* of medium cheddar, monterey jack, and colby, grated</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>In 9x13" pan, spray with Pam. Spread half of cooked macaroni in pan. Sprinkle half of each cheese on top, using monterey jack in middle. Dot with butter, and pour half of egg on top. Pour evaporated milk on top (maybe about 1/4 - scant 1/2 of can). Repeat. Bake at 350-375F until cooked throughout, and top is brownish. Very rich, but delish. Freezes well. From: Nancy Bird Date: Fri 11 Ma Submitted By DALE SHIPP On 15 AUG 94 230411 Henry's Notes: This was pretty good, but it needed something. It also made enough for about 16 folks at my house. I cut the amount of macaroni in half and doubled the cheddar cheese to 8 oz. I also cut the milk in half. The original was just a bit runny fresh from the oven. I think the changes made a major improvement. The extra cheddar gave the zing that was missing. Reducing the amount of macaroni cut down on the weeks worth of left overs we had the first time. Try the new improved version. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

      <li>Remove sausage casings and crumble sausage. Brown meat in large pot, stirring occasionally to break up the meat. Drain off fat. Remove meat and set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in the same pot, add onion, garlic and bell pepper and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 5 to 8 minutes or until onion is tender. Stir in the reserved meat, tomato puree, tomato paste, water, basil, oregano, sugar, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bay leaf and bring to boil. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours, or until flavors mingle and mixture thickens slightly (there will be about 4 1/2 to 5 cups of sauce). Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, egg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl; set aside. Bring 3 quarts of water to boil in a large pot. Add 1 tablespoon salt, then gradually add lasagne noodles so that water continues to boil. Cook noodles until barely tender, about 5 minutes, stirring once or twice; do not overcook. Drain noodles; rinse in cold water and drain well. Return noodles to pot and toss them gently with 1 tablespoon oil to prevent them sticking. Line the bottom of a a buttered 9 x 13 x 2-inch pan with 4 lasagne noodles, cutting one as necessary to completely cover the bottom. Spread evenly with half of ricotta mixture (1 generous cup). Sprinkle evenly with half of mozarella (about 2 cups). Spread with half of the tomato/meat sauce. Top with remaining 4 noodles, cutting one noodle as above so that the sauce mixture is completely covered. Evenly layer on remaining ingredients in the same order as above. Sprinkle the top of the lasagne evenly with 1/4 cup Parmesan and 1/4 cup mozzarella. Bake in a preheated oven at 375 for about 45 or 50 minutes or until lasagne is hot in center.
