      <li>need enough smaller lobsters to produce a total of about 8 cups of meat after boiling and cooling. STEP ONE: The Sauce-- Heat butter to melting point in a large saucepan, add mushrooms and green pepper. Cook until tender. Add paprika and stir in sherry. Cook until liquid is reduced by half. Salt and pepper to taste; add cream sauce (see included recipe in this cookbook) and pimientos and blend well. Bring to a simmer. STEP TWO: The Lobster-- This can be done while vegetables are cooking. Remove claws and knuckles from lobster. Hold lobster with its top side up. With kitchen shears, cut an oval opening in top of shell from tip of tail to base of head. Remove meat from body, claws, and knuckles. Cut in a large dice. CHEF'S NOTE: Discard intestinal vein and stomach--a hard sac near the head--before dicing. STEP THREE: Add meat to sauce and simmer slowly for 10 minutes. Divide mixture evenly and spoon back into lobster shell. Dust with grated parmesan cheese and brown in a 375-degree oven for 15 minutes. Serve.

      <li>1. Preheat oven to 350F degrees. 2. Cook macaroni in salted boiling water according to package directions. Drain and rinse well with cold water. Pour into a 3 quart casserole. 3. In a saucepan, melt butter and stir in flour. Gradually stir in milk and sour cream. Add salt and pepper. 4. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until sauce bubbles and thickens. 5. Reserve 1 cup grated cheese for the top of the casserole. Toss macaroni with remaining cheese. 6. Pour sauce over macaroni and mix thoroughly. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. 7. Bake for 1 hour, or until bubbly and browned. 8. Serve immediately. NOTES : From Mimi: Believe it or not, this was served at a temple dinner one Friday night. It was so good, I asked for the recipe. Low fat, it's not, but I have had some success using lower fat ingredients such as milk and sour cream, though I wouldn't bother with nonfat sour cream. I also use less cheddar than this recipe calls for...or I double everything except the sour cream and cheddar. Whatever works...it's the best version I've ever eaten.

      <li>The following is from Molly O'Neill's "New York Cookbook:" "As Mr. Horn and Mr. Hardart discovered, this is a great do-ahead dish for a crowd, keeps well, and reheats like a dream. It certainly was an Automat favorite." 1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 1-1/2-quart baking dish. 2. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour, then add the milk, salt and both peppers. Stir almost constantly until the mixture thickens and is smooth, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the cheese and cook, stirring, until it melts. Remove from the heat. 3. In a mixing bowl, combine the macaroni and the sauce. Stir in the tomatoes and sugar. Transfer the macaroni mixture to the greased baking dish. Bake until the surface browns, 30 to 40 minutes. Serves 4 to 6 Posted to TNT - Prodigy's Recipe Exchange Newsletter by "Peggy L. Makolondra" &lt;pmakolon@mail.wiscnet.net&gt; on Aug 05, 1997</li>

Let ham stand in liquid over night. Next day remove the fatty rind, make gashes across the surface of ham and stick in whole cloves. Make a paste of the sugar, flour and mustard by adding the syrup and water. Use water in which ham was cooked if available. Spread over ham and place in roasting pan. Bake uncovered at 400-F for 45 minutes.

In a large pot, heat water to boil. Add pasta and cook until just tender (about 8 minutes). Drain and rinse pasta under cold water. Place in a large bowl and set aside. 2. Lightly grease a large baking dish. In a skillet heat sherry and olive oil and saute green onion, garlic, and bell pepper until pepper is soft but not mushy. Add cumin, oregano, basil, asparagus (cut diagonally into 2-inch pieces), cherry tomatoes, and snow peas, and saute 2 minutes, stirring frequently. 3. Remove from heat and toss with pasta and Primavera Sauce. Spoon into baking dish. Bake until lightly browned and bubbling (about 25 minutes). Primavera Sauce: In a saucepan heat butter and stir in flour. Cook 2 minutes, stirring, to eliminate floury taste, then slowly add milk, stirring with a whisk. If milk is added slowly enough, the sauce should thicken to a heavy cream consistency. Add cheese and pepper.

See Note: To prepare Parsely.I take the bunch in one hand very near the leaves, and pull down the stalks, with the other hand I twist the stalks till they torn,Wash leaves in bowl with plenty of water and dry them with paper towel. In your Food Processor use still knife, put Parsley and use - on / off button 2 -3 times, Add all other ingredients - not Granulated garlic but the fresh mashed one, Add another 1/2 teasp salt and some ground fresh pepper. Work Food Processor again on/off button, till all blend nice. Arrange over the halibut and spread evenly on top. Cover with aluminium foil and Bake in pre heated 375 F hot oven for 20 minutes.&lt;&lt;&lt; Take off Cover and continue to bake for another 20 -25 minutes. or till you get nice color on top, and your folk will come easy out of fish. &lt;&lt;&lt; At this stage ,if you get some guests, you can prepare the fish an hour before they arrives, and continue the second stage 25- 30 minutes before you serve the dish, Uncover and continue as written above.

      <li>2 Celery stalks, with leaves,</li>
      <li>Chopped</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions; chopped</li>
      <li>1 Carrot; sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped fresh parsley</li>

      <li>8 ounces Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>3 Allspice berries</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly &amp; cutting into serving pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl. Make a marinade by combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine, &amp; vinegar &amp; pouring over the meat. Cover &amp; refrigerate for a day or two, turning the pieces over occasionally. On serving day, drain, reserving the marinade, &amp; wipe dry. Transfer the marinade to a casserole &amp; simmer for 15 minutes. While the marinade is cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan, &amp; when very hot sear the meat over high heat until it is reddened in color without browning. Remove from the heat, &amp; with a spatula lift the rabbit or hare pieces into the simmering marinade, then pour in the remaining butter. Taste for seasoning, then add the salt &amp; pepper, tomatoes, &amp; allspice. Weight the meat with a small plate to keep it under the sauce, then bake it in a very slow oven (225 F) for 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender &amp; the sauce thickened.

      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 quart Brick ice cream or molded ice cream; very cold</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: MERINGUE</li>
      <li>2 Egg whites</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cream of tartar</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is the result ofJefferson's ingenious mind as an engineer, architect, and cook. He developed methods of putting a dough or meringue on a bit of ice cream and then baking it. His guests must have been fascinated with the things the man of Monticello would develop. He actually invented what we now call Baked Alaska. You can bake this in an oven or you can use a small acetylene torch. Don't let the kids try this or you may lose the house! Have the egg whites at room temperature. Whip in your electric mixer along with the cream of tartar. When they form stiff peaks, fold in the sugar and vanilla. Frost the ice cream form and bake in a preheated 350Ã¸ for 10-15 minutes, or until the meringue is lightly browned. I have much better luck browning the meringue with a hand-held acetylene torch.

If any one has some upscale, low fat recipes out there I would appreciate you sending them to the list. Thanks, Eric * Exported from MasterCook II * Combine onion, olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon rosemary, garlic, and orange peel in a 13-x 9-x 2-inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 400Ã¸ for 10 minutes or until onion begins to brown, stirring once. Stir in tomato and capers; bake 5 additional minutes or until mixture thickens. Stir in orange juice and pepper. Add halibut to tomato mixture; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon of rosemary. Spoon tomato mixture over halibut; bake, uncovered, 10 minutes or until fish flakes at the edges when tested with a fork. Don't over cook, if fish is slightly underdone in the center don't worry it will continue to cook in the sauce. This is especially true if it is held a short amount of time before service. Remove and discard orange peel. Sprinkle with olives and serve. Yield: 2 servings. MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MasterCook recipe list.

On top of pasta, place the following: 3 pieces of asparagus, followed by 2 tablespoons pesto, followed by another piece of pasta. Continue with this layering until you have 4 pieces of pasta and 4 layers of asparagus and pesto mixture. Lay one more piece of pasta on top, followed by a spoonful of pesto mixture and sprinkle each of the 4 gratin dishes with bread crumbs. Put all 4 dishes in oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until bubbling and golden brown on top. Remove and serve immediately.

      <li>From: hartman@infi.net (ron &amp; sally hartman) Date: Thu, 27 Oct 1994 21:56:00 +0000 Here's a great apple crisp recipe I got from a wonderful inn in Vermont. I frequently adapt it to use cranberries. I keep cranberries in the freezer year-round and love to throw them in anything I make with apples. Put apples (and cranberries if you're using them) into a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle with salt. Mix sugar, flour and butter until crumbly (I do this in a food processor). Spread over the apples. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes in preheated 357 degree oven. Serve with ice cream or whipped cream. This smells great while it's baking, and it's delicious! It's one of our family favorites. Note: I usually give the cranberries a quick chopping in the food processor but it also works to use them whole. Depending on the quantity I need I feel free to add more apples and cranberries and increase the amounts of the other ingredients proportionately.

      <li>From: "Annette Fishman" &lt;ybigfish@msn.com&gt; Date: Wed, 17 Jul 96 15:16:41 UT This is in response to the request for a good fatfree cobbler topping. It is actually a "crisp", not cobbler, recipe (I'm not really sure what the difference is), but I think it foots the bill. The topping is crisp and delicious and since this dessert is always a big hit, I'm posting the recipe as well. It comes from Neil Barnard's Food for Life. I usually increase the ingredients by 50% but use the same size pan. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Arrange the apple slices in a 9-inch square baking dish, then sprinkle with cranberries. In a bowl, mix the Grape-Nuts, rolled oats and cinnamon, then stir in the brown rice syrup. Spread evenly over apples. Mix the apple juice and cornstarc or arrowroot, then pour evenly ovser other ingredients. Bake for 50 minutes or until apples are tender. fatfree digest V96 #198 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

Apple cobbler goes back to the time of the Pilgrims, and since it is so easy to make you should offer this bit of edible history to your family very soon. Heat a frying pan and add the 3 tablespoons butter. Put the apples and raisins in the pan and sautâ for a few minutes over medium heat until they are tender. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar, and the spices. Stir and set aside. Pour the melted butter into a 7x11x2-inch baking dish. Mix the remaining cup of sugar with the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well and then stir in the milk. Spread this batter on top of the butter. Pour the apple mixture over the batter and bake in a 350Ã¸ oven for about 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.

Cook the apples for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the apples are tender and caramelized. Remove the pan from the heat and add the brandy. Place the pan back on the stove. Shake the pan a couple of times to ignite the flame. If the flame does not ignite, carefully light the flame with a match. Spread a scoop of the ice cream evenly over each crepe. Starting with one side, gently roll the crepe up like a jellyroll. Place the crepes in the freezer and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Divide the crepes between four shallow bowls. Spoon the apple/walnut mixture over the crepes. Sprinkle the cheese over the top and serve immediately.

      <li>From: Kristin Satterlee &lt;asg36656@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu&gt; Date: 16 Nov 1994 10:23:19 -0500 I never had apple crisp in school in the 60's, but this is an old family recipe, and it is very good, and contains no oatmeal. I hope it works for you. Mix water and lemon juice: sprinkle over apples. Place in large, flat baking dish (the more spread out the apples are, the crispier the coating--otherwise, the size pan is not terribly important). Mix the last four ingredients until crumbly. Spread over apples. Bake at 350 degrees 35-40 minutes. Thanks to Nola Hall. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>This is the Apple Cream Cheese Coffee Cake recipe that I promised to repost for you. I won the Grand Prize for this in November in the Vermont Apple Bake-Off. Hope you like it. In a large bowl, combine flour and sugar; cut in butter using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Remove 1 cup for topping. To the remaining crumb mixture, add baking powder, soda, salt, sour cream, egg and vanilla; blend well. Spread batter over the bottom and 2" up the side of a greased and floured 9" springform pan (batter should be 1/4" thick on sides). For filling #1, in a small bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice and egg; blend well and pour over the batter in the pan. To make apple filling, mix all apple ingredients together and carefully spoon over the cream cheese filling. In a small bowl, combine reserved crumb mixture with the nuts and sprinkle over the top. Bake at 350 degrees for 55-60 minutes or until cream cheese filling is set and crust is a deep golden brown. Cool 15 minutes then remove sides of pan. Cool completely and then drizzle with maple glaze if desired. For maple glaze, mix all ingredients together.

      <li>(From a long-lost acquaintance) Grease and 8 inch cake pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Use lemon juice while cutting the apples to prevent browning from oxidation. Tightly layer the apples into pan. Sift the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Cut in the butter. Sprinkle it on the apples, trying to seal the edges. Bake about 1 hour; serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream, ice cream, or lemon sorbet. I like to serve candied or crystalized ginger with the crisp.

Press down to even out the apples. Prepare the topping by combining all the dry ingredients first. Then cut in the butter until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. (This works really well in a food processor.) Spread the topping evenly over the apples and press down. Bake about 1 hour in a 350 degree oven.

NOTES: * One-crust apple-crumb pie -- The pie can also be frozen and then baked, right from the freezer, at 360 for 90 minutes. The pies will keep a very long time in the freezer and not be worse for wear. * PS: For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but the convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday when the mood grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a big plastic bag. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking. : Precision: approximate measurement OK. : Margaret Reek : Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY : mmr@ritcv.UUCP : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>from &lt;&lt;Faye Levy's International Jewish Cookbook&gt;&gt; Instead of applesauce with latkes, this can be served as a chunky topping or pureed into a flavorful fresh applesauce. When the apples are left in pieces, the compote can be served as a dessert on its own; its especially good served hot with ice cream, sour cream, or yogurt. Peel &amp; halve the apples. Core &amp; cut into thin wedges or slices. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add apples &amp; saute, turning pieces over from time to time, for about 2 minutes or until they are coated with butter. Add lemon juice and cinnamon, cover &amp; cook over low heat for 5 minutes, or until liquid begins to come out of the apples. Uncover &amp; continue cooking over low heat, gently stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes or until apples are tender and begin to fall apart. Add 2 tbsp sugar &amp; saute over medium-high heat, turning apples over, about 2 minutes or just until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Taste &amp; add more sugar if necessary; heat, tossing apples gently, until sugar dissolves. Serve warm or at room temperature to accompany latkes. Can be kept covered in refrigerator for 2 days.

      <li>From: dmcmenam@mtholyoke.edu (Dianna McMenamin) Date: 29 Nov 1993 17:06:24 GMT I think every apple crisp recipe I've ever seen uses oatmeal, although my eleven-year-old made the following recipe and substitued rye meal, and it tasted just fine. The recipe is from "Dollar a Day Cookbook" by Ruth and Bill Kaysing (1977, Chronicle Books, San Fransisco). (I also recommend the more complicated recipe found in the Moosewood Cookbook.) If you want to simplify this recipe further, omit the wheat germ, bran, and rice flour. Instead just add more oats, and substitute in some wheat flour. Wash, core and slice 8 large apples. Mix the honey, lemon juice, and cinnamon, and add them to the apples. Toss to mix and coat. Place the mixture in a buttered baking dish and add a topping made of the remaining ingredients, mixed well and sprinkled over the apples to cover. Bake in a preheated oven at about 325 degrees for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the apples are tender. Remove and see how much cooling time you can allow before it's totally devoured by apple bandits. Serves 6 normal people, or 2 apple bandits! REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>One batch flaky pie dough for a 2-crust pie</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds Firm; tart apples, such as northern spy, granny smith or golden delicious</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Sugar; light brown sugar or a combination of both</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Cranberries; rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Finely grated lemon zest</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Cold unsalted butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To form the pie crust, remove dough from refrigerator and place on flat work surface. Roll dough, still between sheets of plastic, to a 12-inch disk. Peel off top piece of plastic and invert dough into 9-inch pie pan. Gently press dough into pan and peel off top piece of plastic. Trim off excess dough even with edge of pie pan. Chill crust while preparing filling. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the lowest level. For filling, peel, halve and core apples. Cut apples into 1/2-inch dice. Place diced apples in a bowl and add filling ingredients, except butter, tossing well to combine. Place filling in dough-lined pan, mounding it slightly in center. Dot filling with butter. For the top crust, lightly flour work surface and dough and roll to a 9 by 12-inch rectangle; cut each piece of dough into 12 strips, each 9 inches long and an inch wide. Egg wash the strips and arrange five of them, equidistant from each other, on the top of the pie, allowing the excess dough to hang over the edge of the pie. Place five more strips perpendicular to the first ones on the pie. Trim away excess dough at the edge of the pie and apply the last two strips to the edge of the pie, egg wash side down. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush with egg wash. If you wish, sprinkle the top of pie with sugar. Bake the pie for 15 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven. Lower the temperature to 350 degrees and move the pie to the middle rack. Bake the pie about 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is a deep golden and the juices are just beginning to bubble up.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine apples, quince and raisins in stainless-steel mixing bowl. There should be about 8 cups fruit. Add sugar to taste, 1/4-1/2 cup, depending on sweetness of fruit. Do not over-sweeten. To make topping, combine in work bowl of food processor - or in separate stainless-steel mixing bowl - 1/2 cup sugar, walnuts, flour and salt. Stir to mix well. If using processor, add 2 tablespoons butter and pulse briefly to mix. Add another tablespoon and pulse again. If combination takes on consistency of moist sand, stop processing. If not, add remaining tablespoon butter and pulse again. If making by hand, follow same procedure, rubbing flour mixture and butter between finger tips rather than in processor. Pour fruit into buttered 13x9" baking dish and spread evenly. Distribute topping by hand over top, breaking up large clumps. Bake at 350'F. 45-50 minutes or until fruit is tender and topping is browned.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Thanks to everyone who has posted fig recipes-- haven't tried any yet, but they sound good. I did find a website with info and recipes about figs (http://www.californiafigs.com), but also whipped up some very good fig apple bran muffins. Preheat oven to 400 F. Combine cereal and apple juice in large bowl. Let stand as you peel, core, and grate apple and chop figs. Add both along with oil and apple sauce. Sift dry ingredients into mixtue and stir to make batter. Fill cups of oiled muffin pan or baking cups and bake about 18 minutes. Muffins are done when toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Between the figs and the bran, these are high in fiber, and with only 3 T of oil, they're lower in fat than the muffins on the back of the All Bran box, and very tasty. They're not dry or bland, but for an even sweeter muffin without additional fat, you could whip up a simple glaze with 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1/2 T vanilla extract and 1 T skim milk. Just whisk them together and pour over the muffins. Enjoy! Posted to EAT-L Digest by Nolan Richardson &lt;elemeno-p@USA.NET&gt; on Aug 3, 1997</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: BAKED APPLES</li>
      <li>6 small Rome beauty; granny smith or golden delicious apples</li>
      <li>1/2 small Lemon</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Dark or golden raisins or currants</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Apricot preserves</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Water</li>
      <li>2/3 Batch quickest puff pastry; recipe follows</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: EGG WASH</li>
      <li>1 Egg beaten well with a pinch of salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the baked apples, set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Peel and core the apples, leaving them whole. Rub them all over with the lemon, then place them in the baking pan. Sprinkle them with the sugar and cinnamon, making sure that some gets into the hollow centers. Stuff the raisins or currants into the centers then place a small slice of the butter on each apple. Bring the preserves and water to a boil in a small pan. Pour around the apples in the pan, then immediately place the pan in the oven. After about 10 minutes, baste the apples every 5 minutes with their juices. The apples should take about 30 minutes to bake. They should be tender but not disintegrating. Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack to cool. Baste the apples with the juices in the pan frequently while they are cooling, then cover and refrigerate the apples until they are thoroughly cold, about 2 to 3 hours. The apples may be prepared up to 2 days before forming and baking the pastries. To form the pastries, remove the apples from the pan and place them on a rack over the pan to drain. (Reserve any leftover juices to make a sauce.) Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees. Place the dough on a floured surface and lightly flour the dough. Roll the dough out into a 10 by 18-inch rectangle. Cut the dough into six 5-inch squares and place them on the prepared pan. Use a small, round, fluted cutter to cut the remaining scrap of dough into 6 small circles. Brush the squares of dough lightly with egg wash. Place an apple in the center of each square. (Replace any raisins or currants that might have fallen out of the centers.) Bring each corner of the dough up to the top center of the apple. Pinch the seams of the pastry together, then carefully brush the outside with the egg wash. Place one of the fluted pastry circles on top of each pastry, where the corners join together. Brush the fluted dough with egg wash. Bake the pastries about 20 to 25 minutes, until deep golden and baked through. Place the pan on a rack to cool slightly before you serve the apples.

      <li>2 tablespoons Margarine Or Butter; Melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut each of the squash in half and remove the seeds and fibers. Place the squash, cut sides down, in an ungreased baking pan. Then add water to the depth of 1/4-inch and bake, uncovered, until the squash is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. While the squash is baking, cook and stir the meat in a large skillet until it is brown. Drain off the excess fat. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the 1 1/2 ts of salt as well as the cinnamon, the coarsely chopped tart apples and the raisins. When the squash is cooked, turn them so that the cut side is up and remove them to a platter. Drain off any remaining liquid in the pan and dry. Scoop out the pulp from the acorn squash, making a shell that is 1/4-inch thick all the way around. Season the shells with salt to taste. Mash the pulp and mix in the meat mixture. Return to the shells, piling them full and sprinkle with 1 tb of brown sugar on each. Drizzle with the melted butter. Bake uncovered until the apple is tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Serve hot. NOTE: You can substitute a combination of 1/2 lb lean ground beef and 1/2 lb of bulk pork sausage for the 1 lb of lean ground beef.</li>

      <li>1 Egg yolk for glazing</li>
      <li>2 cups Ale</li>

      <li>2 Cloves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel and core the apples. Put close together in a deep 10 inch pie dish and sprinkle with six tablespoons sugar mixed with the lemon rind. Pour in 3 tablespoons water. Roll out pastry 1/4" thick and cover apples. Make a 1 inch wide hole in the center of the pastry and put a small collar of pastry around it, wetting it slightly with cold water to join. Brush pie with egg yolk beaten with 2 teaspoons cold water. Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 30-35 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the ale, remaining sugar, and spices slowly to the boiling point, but do not boil; let spices steep in hot ale. When apple pie is done, pour hot ale into center hold through a funnel and serve immediately. Note: Whole apples go into the deep-dish pie that warms many an Englishman, especially in Bedfordshire, at Christmas. As the name suggests, Apple Florentine has Italian origins, though the Resaissance pope for whom it was occasionally prepared never knew the special savor of well-spiced ale that English cooks consder an indispensible part of the recipe.

      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar; mixed with</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>You must have a non-stick skillet or this won't work. Whisk sugar, flour, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt together. Beat milk with eggs and vanilla and whisk this into batter; let stand while you cook the apples. Melt the butter in a large skillet. When foaming subsides, add the apples, cover and cook gently for 5 minutes or until soft. Uncover, raise the heat and evaporate the moisture. When the moisture has almost completely evaporated, add the sugar and finish boiling the juices away. Preheat the broiler with rack set 6 to 7 inches away from heat source. Oil the bottom and sides of a 10-inch non-stick pan with butter or non-stick vegetable cooking spray and heat for a minute. Add 1/3 cup of batter to the pan and tilt so it is well coated. Set skillet on very low heat and cook for 30 seconds. Gently arrange about 1/4 of the apple mixture on the first pancake. Pour in 1/3 cup more batter over the apples to cover them as best as possible. Cook pancake for a minute over medium heat, lower the heat and cook 2 minutes longer. Broil for about 3 minutes or until pancake is cooked through and golden. With a spatula loosen pancake around the edges and transfer to a platter (cover loosely with foil until all 4 pancakes are done or serve immediately). Repeat procedure with other 3 pancakes; serve dusted with confectioner's sugar. Yield: 4 servings MC format by Gail Shermeyer &lt;4paws@netrax.net&gt;.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375F. Spray a 14-in.-round pizza pan or large baking sheet with oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Roll out pizza dough to a 14-in. circle on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin. Transfer to the prepared pan. Cut apples into thin slices (1/4 in. to 1/2 in.). Starting at the outer edge and working toward the center, arrange the slices on pizza dough, overlapping slightly in smaller and smaller circles until the surface is covered. The apple layer should be at least as thick as the crust. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle mixture evenly over apples and bake about 30 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Meanwhile, combine preserves and liqueur in a small saucepan and cook over low heat, until preserves dissolve. To serve, remove the pizza from the oven, brush with warm apricot glaze and cut into wedges.

Stir in orange juice gradually, mixing with wooden spoon, until dough cleans the bowl. Use only as much orange juice as needed. Cover, chill for 1 hour. Roll out 2/3 of dough on a floured board into a 10 inch square. Place into a greased 8-inch pan so the dough comes up around the sides of the pan. Combine the filling ingredients; spread evenly on the crust. Roll out the remaining piece of dough into a 9-inch square and put over filling. Moisten edges around the pan, and press both sides together to seal. Prick top of crust with a fork. (My mother always brushed the top with a beaten egg mixes with water and then sprinkled top with a cinnamon-sugar mix. I omit that) Bake in a preheated hot oven - 400f- for 35 to 40 minutes or until brown. Cut into squares and serve warm. JEWISH-FOOD digest 311 From the Jewish Food recipe list.

    <ingredient>
      <li>*INGREDIENTS*</li>
      <li>10 cups Apples, slices thin</li>
      <li>1 Stick butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Bread crumbs, very fine</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar, or more if apples are tart</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 Lemon rind (grandma does NOT use this)</li>
      <li>1/2 Stick butter, melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Source: Treasured Slovenian &amp; International Recipes *DIRECTIONS* Melt stick of butter and lightly brown the bread crumbs. Set aside to cool. Sprinkle the cooled bread crumbs over the stretched dough. Spread the sliced apples evenly over the dough and sprinkle sugar, cinnamon and lemon rind over the apples. Melt the 1/2 stick of butter and when it has cooled spoon over the apples. Roll up dough. Place in well greased pan and bake in 350 F oven for one hour. notes: Be careful not to puncture the dough when transferring to the pan, otherwise the strudel will stick to the pan. *VARIATIONS* Instead of lemon rind Grandma uses lemon juice. Grandma also waits until the dough is ready to slice the apples, that way they don't turn brown. She also uses the slicer on the side of a grater to slice the apples really thin.

If using arrowroot, remove from heat because boiling has a thinning effect; if using cornstarch, boil gently for 1 minute to remove the raw starch taste. Stir in tahini. Reduce heat to low and mix until smooth. Pour mixture into a large bowl or 4 individual dishes. Let cool, then chill. Tahini is a thick, smooth paste made of raw, ground sesame seeds. A custard made without eggs? Yes, and look, no cholesterol! This healthy refinement has just the right texture and flavor.

      <li>No Christmas feast in medieval times was complete without a 'grete pye'. In some recipes, it could contain many varied meats, but quite often only two or three different kinds were suggested; change the meats suggested here if you wish. Use just over half the pastry to line a 23-cm/9-inch pie plate. Brush the inside with some of the egg white. Skin the pieces of breast and other meat if necessary and parboil them gently in salted water for 10-15 minutes. Drain and leave to cool. Mix together in a bowl the minced beef, suet, salt and pepper to taste, the egg yolks and half the spice mixture. Add the rest of the spices to the dried fruit in another bowl. Slice the parboiled meat. Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas Mark 7. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the beef stock to the rice flour or cornflour in a small saucepan and cream them together; then add the remaining stock and stir over gentle heat until slightly thickened. Keep aside. Cover the bottom of the pastry case with half the mince mixture. Arrange the sliced meat in a flat layer on top. Scatter the chopped spiced fruit over it and cover with the remaining mince. Pour the thickened stock over the lot. Roll out the remaining pastry into a round to make a lid for the pie. Brush the rim of the case with a little more egg white and cover with the lid. Press the edges to seal, and make escape slits for steam. Decorate with the pastry trimmings and glaze with egg white. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 45-50 minutes longer. Serves 6 to 8. Grete pyes.

      <li>Remember that it is the total carbohydrate in a food that counts. All carbohydrates -- starches and sugars -- are eventually changed into blood glucose. Diabetics can eat sugar as long as it is counted as part of the total carbohydrate intake for the day. The goal though is to eat healthfully and to not waste your carbohydrates on foods that do not offer much in the way of nutrition (like most high sugar foods). The key with sugar is moderation! Also, remember that sugar free does not mean carbohydrate free. If you do consume foods with artificial sweeteners, be sure to check the total carbohydrate count in the food. Do not assume that it is a good food to eat just because it is sugar free. All of the recipes that we post on this site try to be low-fat, high-fiber and nutritious. Because of possible health risks, you will not see recipes with artificial sweeteners here. We post dessert recipes that, while they may contain some source of sugar (honey, sugar, fruit juice etc.), ! ! ! are relatively low in sugar for a dessert recipe. Again, use common sense and moderation when figuring any food with sugar into your diet.

      <li>Platina mentions several odd fishes not usually used today as food, such as cuttlefish, scorpions, lampreys and sea-lion. But most of his fish are still favorites-eels, lobsters, crabs, oysters, sturgeon and sturgeon eggs (which he calls caviar), salmon, sole, etc., and he gives a recipe for a Squid Dish for Days of Abstinence. Although squid is eaten today in the South of France and Greece, and can be found in special fish shops here, I would prefer salmon or halibut. But if you hanker for squid, just go ahead with it if you can find some, and be sure to have the fish man prepare it for you by removing the black liquid from the backbone. A SQUID DISH FOR DAYS OF ABSTINENCE--1475 Boil the squid. Crush what is good in a mortar. Prepare a paste of almonds with rosewater strained through a sieve; or, if you can't provide this, use the juice of peas or white chickpeas. Crush together small grapes and five figs. Mix a little rock parsley and a little fresh marjoram leaves. Add as much cinnamon, ginger and sugar as is necessary. Mix these well with whites of eggs so that they will stick together and cook better. With the mixture well greased, and with a crust above and beneath, set it on the hearth at a little distance from the flame. Sprinkle sugar and rosewater on the cooked mixture. This dish assails all the members.</li>

      <li>This pickle is often confused with the similar-in-concept, but functionally quite different, than gkwa kiaowan, a sweet &amp; sour cooked relish. Slice the cucumber in four lengthwise, then slice the pieces to segments about an eighth of an inch thick. Slice the tops of the chilis (green ones can be used if red are not available, but Thais like the color contrast), and tap out any loose seeds, and discard, then slice the chilis across into thin rounds. Slice the shallots and water chestnuts. Combine and serve. This will keep 2 or 3 weeks in a referigerator. It is a traditional accomaniment to snacks such as spring rolls, or to barbequed foods.

      <li>** THE FILLING AND FROSTING ** Beat the smoothly melted chocolate into the meringue, along with the vanilla, rum, and soft butter. Remove two-thirds of the mixture to a bowl and refrigerate; this is the frosting. Beat the additional half stick of soft butter into the remaining meringue this is the filling. ** FILLING THE CAKE ** Unroll the sponge sheet and slice a quarter inch off the long sides so that the cake will roll easily. Spread the filling over the top of the sheet. Roll it up from one of the small ends and you have made the log shape. Neatly slice a narrow slanting piece from each end of the log. With a small knife dig a hole in an upper side of the log and insert a piece of the scrap to simulate a bump or a branch. Place the log seam-side down on the serving board and slip double sheets of wax paper under the edge of each side and the two ends-to catch frosting spills. ** FROSTING THE LOG ** Beat 2 or more spoonfuls of sifted cocoa into the frosting mixture to make it a spreadable consistency. (Reserve 2 spoonfuls of frosting for the mushrooms.) Leaving the two ends free, frost the cake using a flexible metal spatula, then scumble it with the spatula and a fork to give it a rough barklike look. ** Ahead-of-time note: Refrigerate the log if you are not contin- uing; it will keep nicely for a day-if you can find a non-mashing cover for it. ** FINAL DECORATIONS, JUST BEFORE SERVING ** The mushrooms. With a small knife, pierce a hole in the bottom of each meringue mushroom cap, insert a bit of the frosting (or softened butter) into the hole and then the pointed end of a meringue stem. Arrange the mushrooms in tasteful clusters upon the log and sprinkle the log with a dusting of confectioner's sugar to give a snowy effect. Dust the tops of the mushrooms with cocoa powder tapped from the sieve. The caramel veil. Bring the sugar to the simmer with the corn syrup and one-third cup water in a small saucepan; when the mixture is completely dissolved and clear, cover tightly and boil to the caramel stage. Let it cool two to three minutes, until it forms thick strands when lifted with a fork. Then dip the fork into the syrup and wave it over the broomstick, to form long hanging threads of caramel. The finale. Lift the caramel strands off the broomstick; drape them over the yule log. Decorate the serving board with sprigs of holly if you wish, and the buche de Noel is ready to serve.

      <li>Let cream cheese, butter and egg yolks stand at room temperature at least 2 hours. Beat cheese in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon or blend at low speed in electric mixer. Add butter and continue beating. When well blended, add sugar, then egg yolks, one at a time. Add vanilla and fold in almonds. Wash and dry the inside of a Pashka mold or a new 2 quart clay or plastic flowerpot with drain holes in the bottom. Line the pot with a double thickness of cheesecloth wrung out in cold water. Spoon cheese mixture into the pot to the brim. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or overnight on a plate. To unmold, trim around and discard top of the cheesecloth. Invert a dessert plate over the opening of the flowerpot and quickly turn the whole thing upside down. Place on table and gently lift off pot, tugging at the cheesecloth lining if necessary. When the pot is clear, gently remove the cheesecloth. Garnish the base and top of the Pashka with whole strawberries and strawberry halves. Serve with additional crushed, sweetened strawberries as a sauce. You may add some brandy or liqueur to the sauce if you wish.

      <li>** THE ORANGE/ALMOND SPONGE SHEET ** Preparing the pan. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the jelly-roll pan with buttered wax paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each end. Roll flour in the pan and shake out excess. The cake batter. Using a wire whisk or hand-held electric mixer, beat the 3 egg yolks in a 3-quart bowl, gradually sprinkling in the 1/2 cup of sugar. When the mixture is thick and pale yellow, beat in the grated orange rind and juice, the almonds, and the almond extract. Slowly sift in the flour, while blending with the whisk. In a very clean separate bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites to soft peaks; sprinkle in the 3 tbsp of sugar and continue beating to form stiff, shining peaks. Stir a quarter of the egg whites into the batter; delicately fold in the rest. Baking the jelly roll. Immediately turn the batter into the prepared pan; bang it lightly but firmly on your work surface to settle it, and place it at once in the middle level of the preheated 375 degree oven. Bake about 10 minutes, until it has very lightly colored and the top is springy-do not overbake or the cake will crack when you roll it up. Cooling and storing. Sprinkle the top of the cake with a 1/16 inch layer of confectioner's sugar; cover with a sheet of wax paper and a lightly dampened towel. Reverse onto a tray or baking sheet. Then whlle the cake is still warm, holding an end of the wax paper, lift off the jelly-roll pan. Carefully peel the wax paper off the cake. Sift another 1/16-inch layer of sugar over the cake and roll it up in the damp towel; place in a plashc bag to keep it from drying out, and refrigerate. (The cake must be cold before you fill and frost it.) ** Ahead-of-time note: The sponge sheet will keep nicely 2 or 3 days in the refrigerator or you may freeze it for several weeks -- but to prevent its breaking, be sure to let it defrost completely before unrolling it. ** THE MERINGUE BASE-ITALIAN MERINGUE ** Beat the egg whites in the electric mixer until foaming through out; add the salt and cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks are formed. Turn mixer speed to slow. In a small saucepan bring the sugar and 1/2 cup water to the simmer, remove from heat, and swirl the pan until the sugar has dissolved completely and the liquid is perfectly clear. Cover the pan tightly and boil to the soft-ball stage (238 degrees). Using moderately slow speed, gradually whip the hot syrup into the egg whites; increase speed to fast and continue at high speed for 5 rninutes, until egg whites form stiff shining peaks and have completely cooled. Plan to use the meringue promptly. ** MERINGUE MUSHROOMS ** Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Scoop a quarter of the me ringue into the pastry bag and squeeze out 8 to 10 half-inch domes on the pastry sheet, to serve as mushroom caps. Hold the l/8-inch tube over the end of the pastry bag and squeeze out 8 to 10 conical shapes 3/4 inch high, for the stems. Bake about 1 hour in the middle level of the oven, until the meringues push easily off the pastry sheet-they should color no more than a darkish cream. Return unused meringue to the main mixture. ** Ahead-of-time note: Meringues may be made in advance and frozen. ** The Directions will continue in Part #3 ** Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #210 by BobbieB1@aol.com on Aug 11, 1997</li>

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 large Whole Duck; giblets removed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Freshly Ground White Pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Ground Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Ground Ginger</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Red Wine Vinegar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sesame Oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Peanut Oil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground Star Anise</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Bring a pot of water, large enough to hold the duck, to a boil. Remove from heat and plunge duck in the water for 5 minutes. Remove and pat dry. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring just to the boil. Off heat, allow mixture to cool to room temperature. Liberally coat the duck with the mixture and let it sit at room temperature for 3 hours so that the coating dries out. To cook: Place duck on a rack, breast side up in a preheated 350 degree oven for 2- 2 1/2 hours. Roast until skin is crisp and brown. Check occasionally and regulate temperature so that the coating does not burn. To serve: Let duck cool to room temperature. Carefully carve pieces from the bone being sure to include the crisp skin. Roll up in Chinese Pancakes (recipe follows) with a dab of hoisin sauce and slivered green onions. CHINESE PANCAKES 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup boiling water 2 tablespoons minced green onion 2 tablespoons sesame oil In a bowl combine the flour and water stirring constantly until all the water is absorbed. Add more water if mixture seems dry, dough should just hold together in large lumps. Add green onions and gather and kneed dough on a lightly floured board (or in a mixer) until smooth, about 5 minutes. Wrap in plastic and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Unwrap, knead again for 5 minutes. Form into a log about 18 inches long and 1-inch in diameter. Cut roll into 20 pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Dip one side of ball in the sesame oil and place oiled side on top of another ball. Roll out the two into a circle about 6 inches in diameter. (Rolling the two together, helps keep them moist inside.) Heat an ungreased saute pan over low heat. Put double pancakes into pan and cook until dry on one side. Flip and dry out other side. Remove pancakes, peel them apart and set aside. Cover with plastic. At serving time, steam briefly or wrap in plastic and cook in microwave at full power for 30-40 seconds.

    <title>A To Z of Spices (Part 2)</title>
    <category>Info/tips</category>
    <category>Spices</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>No Ingredients</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>FENUGREEK: These small, yellow-brown seeds have a slight bitter flavor which, when added in small quantities, is very good in curries, chutneys and pickles, soups, fish and shellfish dishes. GINGER: Available in many forms. Invaluable for adding to many savory and sweet dishes and for baking gingerbread and brandy snaps. Fresh ginger root looks like a knobby stem. It should be peeled and finely chopped or sliced before use. Dreid ginger root is very hard and light beige in color. To release flavor, "bruise" with a spoon or soak in hot water before using. This dried type is more often used in pickling, jam making and preserving. Also available in ground form, preserved stem ginger and crystallized ginger. MACE &amp; NUTMEG: Both are found on the same plant. The nutmeg is the inner kernel of the fruit. When ripe, the fruit splits open to reveal bright red arils which lie around the shell of the nutmeg - and once dried are known as mace blades. The flavor of both spices is very similar - warm, sweet and aromatic, although nutmeg is more delicate than mace. Both spices are also sold ground. Use with vegetables; sprinkled over egg dishes, milk puddings and custards; eggnogs and mulled drinks; or use as a flavoring in desserts. PAPRIKA: Comes from a variety of pepper (capsicum) and although similar in color to cayenne, this bright red powder has a mild flavor. PEPPER: White pepper comes from ripened berries with the outer husks removed. Black pepper comes from unripened berries dried until dark greenish-black in color. Black pepper is more subtle than white. Use white or black peppercorns in marinades and pickling, or freshly ground as a seasoning. Both are available ground. Green peppercorns are also unripe berries with a mild, light flavor. They are canned in brine or pickled, or freeze-dried in jars. They add a pleasant, light peppery flavor to sauces, pates and salad dressings. Drain those packed in liquid and use either whole or mash them lightly before using. Dry green peppercorns should be lightly crushed before using to help release flavor, unless otherwise stated in a recipe. POPPY SEEDS: These tiny, slate-blue seeds add a nutty flavor to both sweet and savory dishes. Sprinkle over desserts and breads. SAFFRON: This pice comes from the stigmas of a species of crocus. It has a distinctive flavor and gives a rich yellow coloring to dishes, however, it is also the most expensive spice to buy. Available in small packets or jars (either powdered or in strands - the strands being far superior in flavor). This spice is a must for an authentic paella or Cornish Saffron Cake. Also an extremely good flavoring for soups, fish and chicken dishes. SESAME SEEDS: High in protein and mineral oil content, sesame seeds have a crisp texture and sweet, nutty flavor which combines well in curries and with chicken, pork and fish dishes. Use also to sprinkle over breads, cookies and pastries before baking. STAR ANISE: This dried, star-shaped seed head has a pungent, aromatic smell, rather similar to fennel. Use very sparingly in stir-fry dishes. Also good with fish and poultry. TURMERIC: Closely related to ginger, it is an aromatic root which is dried and ground to produce a bright, orange-yellow powder. It has a rich, warm, distinctive smell, a delicate, aromatic flavor and helps give dishes an attractive yellow coloring. Use in curries, fish and shellfish dishes, rice pilafs and lentil mixtures. It is also a necessary ingredient in mustard pickles and piccalilli. All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark place, as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

    <title>A Dirt Simple, Plain, But Tried and True Texas Chili Recipe</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Beef; preferably a chuck or round, about, (don't use a fancy cut!) (up to 3)</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds The best double-smoked bacon you can find</li>
      <li>2 large Onions; chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground cumin; (or more to taste)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Good quality chili powder; (I use Santa Cruz hot, but adjust this for taste) (up to 2)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Paprika; (optional, for color and less heat) (up to 2)</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic; (optional) (up to 4)</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(taught me by an old friend Ed from Texas, as much a Texas boy as there ever was) In keeping with all good recipes, measurements are pretty on the fly here. Cube the beef into bite-sized chunks. Dice the bacon. Heat a large heavy pot, fry the bacon until almost crisp. Scoop it out and set aside (so it won't get burnt). Then fry the meat in the bacon fat until browned on all sides -- you may have to do this in batches. Scoop out the meat and add to the bacon. Saute the onions (and garlic if you're using it) in the bacon. (Those who really get concerned can drain off some of the fat, but it won't be true Texan at that point.) When it's soft, throw in the cumin, chile powder, and paprika and cook briefly. Return the meat, cover with water and bring it to a boil. Taste and add salt, then cover and set it to simmer for a couple of hours. Thicken as needed with cornmeal or stale tortillas. Serve with sour cream or cottage cheese, diced onions and, of course, beer. Like all good chilis this is best made a day in advance and reheated.

      <li>1 can (15-oz) kidney beans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the tops off the dried chiles. Toast them in a hot frying pan for a few minutes until fragrant and then soak them in hot water for 20 minutes. Liquidise them with some of the soaking water. Roughly chop the habanero and the garlic and add them to the liquidiser along with the cumin and origano. Puree some more. Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the onion until softened. Add the meat and cook until browned. Add the chile puree, tomatoes and beans. Cover and simmer for at least half an hour. Uncover, raise the heat a little and allow the excess liquid to evaporate (about 10 minutes). Serve it any way you fancy.

    <title>A Lot More on Jelly</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>A little (maybe a lot) more</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: DDMmom If a fruit jells easily, larger amounts of jelly can be made at one time, especially if the jelly maker has experience. When there's no one to show you the "sheeting test" to determine if the jell point has been reached, there's a much more accurate way. Place candy thermometer in boiling water, and note the temperature. For jelly, the proper point has been reached when the temp is 8 degrees higher; for preserves, it's 9 degrees higher. The easiest and much more economical method is to use commercial pectin. It's not as much fun, but in many cases it's the only way to get a jell. (Herb jellies unless you use an apple, orange, or grape base, will not jell without commercial pectin.) If you use sterilized jars and lids, processing isn't too important. However, in the deep south with heat and humidity, the keeping qualities are greatly improved using this method. Topping with paraffin makes the use of unique jars possible, but it's not a reliable method for me. It definitely works in other areas of the country, and for short term storage I do use it- for gift giving with the admonition to use in the near future included on the card, for instance. I wish I could recommend a good book- there are bound to be many, but mine are so old they're out of print. Call your county agent, and look in cartons of canning jars for booklet offers. And the library. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

      <li>1. Make a firm short crust using some eggs with the water to mix the flour and a little salt; but no sugar. 2. Roll it out but not to thin, and with it line a tin pie mould that opens and is kept closed with a metal skewer. 3. Put in the middle of the pie 3 young partridges (boned) and 4. round them put 6 fine quail boned and stuffed. 5. Round these put 12 larks, boned. 6. Cut a little bacon and dice and sprinkle them into the pie. 7. Put in some sour grapes and a very little salt. 8. And fill up with boned thrushes ans other small birds. 9. Put in neither spice, nor cheese nor water. 10. Ornament the top crust; make a hole in the middle; brush it over with yolk of an egg, and bake in a very moderate oven for several hours according to size. Meantime make some good clear nicely flavoured game stock that will be a firm jelly when cold; strain it, and directly the pie comes from the oven pour it, hot, into the pie by means of a funnel placed in the hole in the middle of the lid. NB - This pie may be eaten hot or cold. For a ball supper it will of course be eaten cold. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #268 by Matt &lt;mdj@cableinet.co.uk&gt; on Oct 04, 1997</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>

      <li>2 cups Stock</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: OPTIONAL</li>

      <li>Salt and fine white pepper as desired</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Not to start a sauce war, but this is just my take on the basic sauce scene based on reading many cook books (written before and after Escoffier), and just some rule of thumb ideas that seem to work for me. Melt butter and mix with flour with a fork. Add warm stock (chicken, veal, vegetable, whatever), and whisk smooth. Add optionals if you wish. Simmer, uncovered, skimming off scum as needed. Cornstarch can be substituted for flour by using 1.5 C stock and adding 0.5 C water mixed with cornstarch after adding stock. Whisk well in either case. The solids can be added then for the reduction. Strain the solids out before using. This sauce should be pale and clear. White wine in a modest amount (substitued for stock) with some tarragon leaves is nice with fowl. Some like a garlic clove.

    <title>A Taste of Honey</title>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>honey. From the first light of civilization, this golden sweet liquid has been held in high regard by man as a food, medicine, trading commodity, and as a social and spiritual force. It is hard to imagine the work that goes into its production. The worker bee of a hive must literally work herself to death during her six-week life span. It takes 556 worker bees flying one and one-third the distance around the world, to produce one ounce of honey! And, the honeybee is essential because of her ability to pollinate crops. The value of this service to farmers outweighs the dollar value of the entire honey production. Most of us are familiar with honey in its liquid state, clear and shimmering. But it can be found in other forms too. Look for these: Liquid Honey - is extracted from the comb and strained. Freshly extracted honey may crystallize within a few weeks. When heat-treated to remain liquid, it should keep for several months at room temperature, and is best kept tightly covered. Creamed Honey - is made by seeding liquid honey with finely granulated honey and storing it under controlled conditions until completely granulated. Since it has a smooth, fine texture and spreads easily, it is becoming increasingly popular. Comb Honey - is natural honey sealed in wax that is made by the bees in the hive. It may be sold in sections in wooden frames or it may be cut in sections and each piece wrapped separately. Chunk Honey - is labeled as such. It is sold in a container and consists of pieces of comb honey as well as liquid. Pasteurized Honey - may be either liquid or creamed honey that has been heated or "pasteurized" to destroy the yeasts that might cause the honey to ferment. Pasteurization does not affect the quality of the honey and it will keep almost indefinitely. It is labeled "pasteurized". Honey is sold in various size containers from 8 ounces to 8 pounds. It is a more economical buy in large containers. Color and Flavor: Honey varies in color, flavor and aroma depending on the kind of flowers from which the bees have gathered the nectar. As a rule, the lighter the honey, the milder the flavor. Clover honey is white and mild, while buckwheat honey is dark and strong. Honey may be a blend of several flavors. The color classes are: white, golden, amber and dark. The color is stated on the label. Storing: Honey is best stored at room temperature in a dry place. High temperatures may cause honey to darken. Creamed honey will change in texture when stored in a hot room and in this case is best refrigerated. Honey when well sealed may be stored almost indefinitely in the freezer without any changes occuring in flavor or texture. Use in Cooking and Baking: Honey may be used in place of sugar in many recipes but the amount of liquid must be reduced. One cup of honey may replace one cup of sugar but the liquid should be cut by one quarter. In a plain cake recipe, honey may be substituted for one half the sugar. Some baked foods made with honey may brown more quickly than those made with sugar and the oven temperature should be slightly lowered. Darker honeys give a distinctive flavor to muffins, breads and bars. To liquify honey, place container over warm water. A cup of honey weighs 12 ounces. A pound of honey measures 1 1/3 cups. Here are a few suggestions in the use of honey: Honey Cinnamon Butter: Cream 1/4 cup butter and blend in 1/4 cup honey and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Spread on hot toast. Honey Butter Sauce: Heat until blended, 3/4 cup honey and 3 tablespoons butter. Cool and add 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. Serve with pancakes or waffles. Honey Nut Sauce: Dissolve 1 tablespoon of instant coffee in 2 tablespoons boiling water. Combine with 1 cup liquid honey and 1/4 cup toasted almonds. Serve over ice cream.

    <recipetext>
      <li>ALLSPICE: These small dark, reddish-brown berries are so called because their aroma and flavor resemble a combination of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Use berries whole in marinades; for boiling and pot roasting meats and poultry; in fish dishes, pickles and chutneys. Also available ground and excellent for flavoring soups, sauces and desserts. ANISE: Commonly called asniseed, these small, brown oval seeds have the sweet, pungent flavor of licorice. Also available ground. Use seeds in stews and vegetable dishes, or sprinkle over loaves and rolls before baking. Try ground anise for flavoring fish dishes and pastries for fruit pies. CARAWAY: Small brown, crescent-shaped seeds with a strong liquorice flavor and especially delicious as a flavoring in braised cabbage and sauerkraut recipes, breads (particularly rye), cakes and cheeses. CARDAMOM: Small, triangular-shaped pods containing numerous small black seeds which have a warm, highly aeromatic flavor. You can buy green or black cardamoms although the smaller green type is more widely available. CAYENNE: Orangey-red in color, this ground pepper is extremely hot and pungent. Not to be confused with paprika which, although related, is mild flavored. CHILI POWDER: Made from dried red chilies. This red powder varies in flavor and hotness, from mild to hot. A less fiery type is found in chili seasoning. CINNAMON &amp; CASSIA: Shavings of bark from the cinnamon tree are processed and curled to form cinnamon sticks. Also available in ground form. Spicy, fragrant and sweet, it is used widely in savory and sweet dishes. Cassia (from the dried bark of the cassia tree) is similar to cinnamon, but less delicate in flavor with a slight pungent 'bite'. CLOVES: These dried, unopened flower buds give a warm aroma and pungency to foods, but should be used with care as the flavor can become overpowering. Available in ground form. Cloves are added to soups, sauces, mulled drinks, stewed fruits and apple pies. CORIANDER: Available in seed and ground form. These tiny, pale brown seeds have a mild, spicy flavor with a slight orange peel fragrance. An essential spice in curry dishes, but also extremely good in many cake and cookie recipes. CUMIN: Sold in seed or ground. Cumin has a warm, pungent aromatic flavor and is used extensively in flavor curries and many Middle Eastern and Mexican dishes. Popular in Germany for flavoring sauerkraut and pork dishes. Use ground or whole in meat dishes and stuffed vegetables. All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark place, as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash, stem and remove the seeds from the chilies. Put the chilies in 3 cups cold water and bring to a boil. After about 45 minutes to an hour, the skins should slop easily. Mash the pulp to a paste. If this seems too difficult, you can substitute chili powder at a ratio of 1 teaspoon of chili powder to 1 pod of chili. Read the instructions on the so or TVP package to see if the product was soaked before hand. If not, use some of the water to prepare this ingredient. Saute the onions in olive oil until translucent. Add the garlic and spices the 12 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then add the TVP nuggets. Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to an hour. If this seems too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal flour used in tortillas. When made in bulk this chili can easily be frozen. total calories per serving: 163 fat:4g (22%) Source: Vegetarian Journal Jan/Feb 95 formatted 2/17/95 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #295 by "Robert Ellis" &lt;rpearson@snowcrest.net&gt; on Nov 5, 1997</li>

Beat cheese in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon or blend at low speed in electric mixer. Add butter and continue beating. When well blended, add sugar, then egg yolks, one at a time. Add vanilla and fold in almonds. Wash and dry the inside of a Pashka mold or a new 2 quart clay or plastic flowerpot with drain holes in the bottom. Line the pot with a double thickness of cheesecloth wrung out in cold water. Spoon cheese mixture into the pot to the brim. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or overnight on a plate. To unmold, trim around and discard top of the cheesecloth. Invert a dessert plate over the opening of the flowerpot and quickly turn the whole thing upside down. Place on table and gently lift off pot, tugging at the cheesecloth lining if necessary. When the pot is clear, gently remove the cheesecloth. Garnish the base and top of the Pashka with whole strawberries and strawberry halves. Serve with additional crushed, sweetened strawberries as a sauce. You may add some brandy or liqueur to the sauce if you wish.

    <ingredient>
      <li>6 To 12 chilies</li>
      <li>3 cups Cold water</li>
      <li>1 package Soy or textured vegetable protein (12oz)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Oil</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion; chopped</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Red pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Paprika</li>
      <li>12 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash, stem and remoeve seeds from the chilies. Put chiliesin 3 cups cold water and bring to a boil. After about 45 minutes to an hour the skins should slip off easily. Mash the pulp into a paste. If this seems too difficult, you can substitute chili powder at the ratio of 1 tablespoon chili powder to a pod of chili. Read the instructions on the soy or TVP package to see if the product was soaked beforehand. If not, use some of the water to prepare this ingredient. Saute the onions in the olive oil until translucent. Add the garlic and spices , then the 12 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then add the nuggets. Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to an hour. If this seems too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal flour used in tortillas. When made in bulk, this chili can readily be frozen.

      <li>Date: Wed, 24 Apr 1996 00:25:32 -0400 From: BobbieB1@aol.com Let cream cheese, butter and egg yolks stand at room temperature at least 2 hours. Beat cheese in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon or blend at low speed in electric mixer. Add butter and continue beating. When well blended, add sugar, then egg yolks, one at a time. Add vanilla and fold in almonds. Wash and dry the inside of a Pashka mold or a new 2 quart clay or plastic flowerpot with drain holes in the bottom. Line the pot with a double thickness of cheesecloth wrung out in cold water. Spoon cheese mixture into the pot to the brim. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or overnight on a plate. To unmold, trim around and discard top of the cheesecloth. Invert a dessert plate over the opening of the flowerpot and quickly turn the whole thing upside down. Place on table and gently lift off pot, tugging at the cheesecloth lining if necessary. When the pot is clear, gently remove the cheesecloth. Garnish the base and top of the Pashka with whole strawberries and strawberry halves. Serve with additional crushed, sweetened strawberries as a sauce. You may add some brandy or liqueur to the sauce if you wish.

      <li>3 ounces Shrimp</li>
      <li>2 Onions sliced</li>

      <li>2 cups White wine</li>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>3/4 ounces Gelatin</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put the codfish (or other white fish) in a pan with the onions, vinegar, ginger root, spices, wine and water. Bring it gently to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the scallops and prawns and cook for a further 3 minutes. Remove the fish; bone and skin the white fish and set it all aside. Strain the cooking juices and set aside to cool for several hours by which time a lot of the sediment will have settled in the bottom of the bowl. Carefully pour off the juices, leaving the sediment, and then strain several times through a clean teacloth. You should have appoximately 3 cups of liquid left. Melt 3/4 oz of gelatin in a little of the liquid, cool it to room temperature, then mix it into the rest of the juices. Pour a thin layer (1/2 inch) of the juice into the bottom of a 5 cup souffle dish or fish mold and put it in the fridge to set. Flake the white fish into smallish flakes; remove the coral from the scallops and cut the white flesh into three of four pices. Once the jelly is firm, arrange the most decorative of the fish in the bottom of the dish-- some scallop coral in the middle, prawns around the outsides, flakes of white fish in between or however you feel inspired. Spoon a little more of the juice and return it to the fridge to set. Continue to layer the fish in the mould, setting each layer with a covering of juice until you have used up all the fish and juices. Leave the jelly to set for at least 4 hours in a fridge. Unmold and decorate with fresh herbs; serve as a starter.</li>

Put the container into the refrigerator chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the dough into long strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a pretzel) put them back into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when they have raised to approximately what looks to be the right hight. Bake in a 450 deg pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, ( May vary with the weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be a light brown before you remove them. Refrigeration is one of the keys of "KRINGLA" making. They must be refrigerated in order for them to get the flavor, you could bake them without refrigeration but you lose a lot of the flavor. You can also use. A: OATMEAL. B: RAISINS. C: WHOLE WHEAT. You can fill them with your favorite filling, Cream Cheese, Jelly, ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast. They are not too sweet, and definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry Bagel lovers, VBG). It is a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too sweet, and also do not have too many calories. This recipe came from a fella from the town of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who started baking and selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this is an original recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the Grandmas). Ive tried Nuts, and love the cream Cheese one, You could even use Custard Filling, Ive also used Different flavored oils like Pure orange oil, Butterscotch, several Berries types. and they turned out just great.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 19:47:16 -0500 From: RickD011@aol.com Add one once of tequila to a tall thin glass such as a parfait glass or champagne flute. Carefully add about 1/2 teaspoon (1 teaspoon for the chile head version) of tabasco down the side of the glass; it should sink to the bottom. Even more carefully add one ounce of Sambuca (an Italian anise liquor). You should have three layers, with the tabasco in the middle. Drop a coffee bean into the drink. This is usually drunk in one gulp, then you bite the bean. You can probably substitute ouzo or anisette for the sambuca, and your favorite hot sauce for the tabasco as long as it's not too thick. If the densities of the substitutes are much different, however, you might not get nice distinct layers. CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #285 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>1 Information</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>If you do not wish to handle lye, do not have wood ashes available, or do not have the time to make soap from scratch, you can still make homemade soaps. You can purchase castille granules at most drugstores. There is no need to mess with lye when using these granules. Since they are actually granulated soap, it is easy to make soap from them. Put the granules into a kettle and add water. Instructions for use will probably be on the package. If not, use common sense in adding water. (Don't drown the granules.) Heat the mixture at low to medium heat and stir it constantly with a large wooden spoon. The granules will dissolve. Stir the mixture until it is smooth. Remove it from the heat and add any other ingredients or emolients that you want. Stir them in well as the soap cools. Add perfume (if desired) as they very last ingredient. Blend it in so that the fragrance will be evenly dispersed. Pour the mixture into molds, and let harden. If the soap does not set (that is, if the bars do not get hard) reheat the mixture, adding more castille granules as necessary. Before it cools completely, you will need to add more perfume because reheating the mix will release the volatile floral oils, thus destroying them.

    <quantity>25</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: HOT WATER CRUST</li>
      <li>3 pounds Flour</li>
      <li>21 ounces Water</li>
      <li>18 ounces Lard</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>1 Goose; boned</li>
      <li>1 Farm chicken; boned</li>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds Pickled tongue (whole)</li>
      <li>1/2 ounces Mace</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons Black pepper</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Sea salt; ground</li>
      <li>2 ounces Butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>NOTE -- This recipe was written 1747 (Original recipe) "Half a peck of flour (5 lbs) will make the walls of a goose-pie ... Raise your crust just big enough to hold a large goose; first have a picked dried tongue boiled tender enough to peel, cut off the root, bone a goose and a large fowl; take half a quarter of an ounce of mace beat fine, a large teaspoonful of beaten pepper, three teaspoonfuls of salt; mix all together, season your fowl and goose with it, then lay the fowl in the goose, and the tongue in the fowl, and the goose in the same form as id whole. Put half a pound of butter on the top, and lay on the lid. this pie is delicious, either hot or cold, and will keep a great while. A slice of this pye cut down across makes a pretty little side dish for supper." A splendid centre piece for a party. Unless your pie has to go by train to London, like Mr Turner's, there is no need to make such a thick crust. However it must be thick enough to keep in the juices as far as possible. I recommend a hot-water pastry made with 3 lbs flour. It seems that the varieties of poultry in Hannah Glasse's day were not as large as they are now, because you need to increase the seasonings (as in ingredients list IMH). To make pastry ============== Bring water to boil with the lard and the salt. As soon as it comes to the boil, tip it into the middle of the flour, mixing everything together rapidly to a dough with a wooden spoon or electric beater. Leave the dough until it can be handled without too much discomfort, but do not let it allow to cool. Cut off about a quarter for the lid and put the rest into a large hinged pie mould, or even a roasting pan 11Â«" x 9" x 2" as a mould. Quickly and lightly push the pastry up the sides of the tin, being careful to leave no cracks. If the pastry collapses down into a dismal heap, it is a little too hot, so wait and try again. Having put your filling in the pie, put on the lid, fixing it with beaten egg, and make a central hole. Decorate the top with leaves and roses made from the trimmings. Before starting the pastry, soak, boil, trim and skin the tongue as usual. Bone the goose and the chicken. Prepare the seasonings. Proceed as above, putting the tongue inside the chicken inside the goose, seasoning as you go. Put the butter on top and close the pie with the lid section which you reserved. To bake the pie, put it into a hot oven, mark 7 425F for 20 minutes. then lower the heat to Mark 4 350 F and cover the top with brown paper to prevent it from becoming too brown too soon. Leave for 3 hours. It is only prudent to check the pie from time to time. Lower the heat if it is bubbling away too fast, to mark 3 325F. Towards the end of this time, push a larding needle or skewer into the pie through the top central hole; if the juices come out very red, leave the pie a little longer. On the other hand, if they come out a pale pink, that is all right - the pie continues to cook as it cools down (I took mine out of the oven at 1 am., and it was still not quite cold by lunchtime next day, with the juices still liquid: it should have been left until the evening with an hour or two in the refrigerator to set it properly JG).

      <li>These recipes come from Culinary Cyber Sleuth. The first one has no chiles but think they would make a wonderful addition and it sounds great for a special holiday occasion, as does the 2nd one. Heat oven to 250 degrees. Grease a 2-quart casserole. In large skillet, melt margarine. Saute onions until crisp tender. In large bowl, beat eggs; stir in half &amp; half and ham. Pour egg mixture into skillet with onions; mix well. Cook over medium heat. As mixture begins to set, gently lift cooked portions with spatula so that thin uncooked portions can flow to bottom. Avoid constant stirring. Cook until eggs thickened throughout; spoon into prepared casserole dish. Pour soup evenly over top. Bake at 250 degrees for 30 minutes; sprinkle with cheddar cheese and bake 10-15 minutes longer. Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #202 by Judy Howle &lt;howle@ebicom.net&gt; on Nov 16, 1997</li>

To make the filling: Combine ricotta, pepper, parsley and eggs in medium bowl. Mix thoroughly. Reserve cheeses. To assemble the casserole: Cook rigatoni according to package directions, but reduce cooking time by two minutes. Do not overcook. Spread sauce over the bottom of a 9x13x2" baking dish. Top with a layer of pasta. Top pasta with a little more sauce, then several spoons full of ricotta mixture. Spoon together with the back of a large spoon. Top with a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese. Top with a layer of pasta and repeat process, ending with Parmesan this time. Then repeat, ending with mozzarella, etc. Finish with a layer of pasta. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or for about 15 minutes after it begins to bubble around edges. Ricotta will rise to top; it should be slightly set. Allow to stand 10-15 minutes before serving.

      <li>Lay a piece of silver foil, large enough to wrap the salmon in a very loose parcel, on a baking tray. If the salmon is to be served hot, grease the foil with the butter, or use the oil if serving the salmon cold. Thinly slice the lemon and put about half on the foil. Put the salmon on top, with a few slices of lemon inside and lay the rest of the lemon along the top of the salmon. Season generously and wrap loosely, making sure the edges are securely folded together so that no steam can escape. Put into a medium oven, Gas Mk 4,350F,180C, for 10 minutes per pound. If serving hot, take it out of the oven and let it stand for a further 10 minutes. If serving cold, leave the salmon in the foil for two to three hours. To serve: Unwrap the fish and gently pull off the skin. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>This recipe from from the 2/6/98 issue of the Palo Alto Weekly newspaper - It sounds promising. Skin the salmon fillet and remove the pin bones (usually 20-50) with needle-nose pliers. Place the fillet skin side down in a two-inch deep metal baking pan. Squeeze lemon juice onto the fish. Cover the fillet with the lemons, onions, parsley, basil, thyme, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder. Pour the wine and water into the pan. Cover the pan with plastic wrap, then with aluminum foil. Bake at 375-400 degrees for about 30 minutes. Check the fillet with a meat thermometer; when it reaches 130-140 degrees, remove and cool for 15-20 minutes. Remove foil and plastic wrap. Remove the pieces of lemon and onion and drain juices. The salmon should be light pink. To remove from baking pan, tightly cover the pan with fresh plastic wrap and flip the pan onto the plastic wrap. Flip the fillet again from the wrap onto a serving tray. Garnish with Italian parsley, tomato roses or thin lemon slices. Refrigerate for at least one hour. Serve cold with Creamy Dill Sauce.

BTW does anyone know why garlic cloves (raw) and sugar cubes are handed out at a Pidun Haben? I allow 1 cup of raw rice for 10 people if there are alot of other side dishes being served or 1 cup raw if few sides dishes served. Place all ingredients into 9 by 13 pan (I use deep disposables) cover very well with foil. Bake for aprox 45 minutes. This recipe multiplies well and I was able to put 3 cup of raw rice (and the appropriate proportions of other ingredients into a deep disposable pan.

The shrimp can't carry all the delicious sauce however. Serve a loaf of warm, sliced sourdough for dipping.

      <li>May be frozen. Defrost in the fridge, on the way to a picnic or in the microwave if you want them in a hurry. Combine water and yeast in mixer bowl and let stand 5 minutes. Add all purpose flour and mix at medium speed for another 4 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead a few times, form into a ball and place in a well-greased mixing bowl. Turn the ball over to grease the top, cover with a cloth and let stand at room temperature to rise until doubled in volume. While the dough is rising, cook the meat and onions over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and the meat is browned. Drain. Discard fat and juice, return meat and onions to the pan. Add tomato sauce, catsup, seasoning and cook over medium heat until the meat is dry with no noticeable liquid. Set meat mixture aside to cool until dough is ready. After the dough has doubled in volume, transfer it to a lightly floured working surface. Knead lightly. Form into a roll and cut into 12 equal portions. Form each portion into a little ball, cover with a cloth and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll each ball out to form a circle 5 to 6 inches across. Put about 1/4 cup of the meat mixture in the center of the circle. Pull the dough up around the filling and press together at the top. Place on a well greased cookie sheet, cover with a cloth and let stand about 30 to 40 minutes at room temperature or until doubled in volume. Bake at 350 F for 40 to 45 minutes or until lightly browned and firm.

      <li>1 tablespoon Regular yellow mustard</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Honey mustard</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Score salami, end to end, in several places to allow fat to drain while cooking. Foil line a shallow baking dish and place salami in it. Cover with sauce (just mix ingredients no baking) and bake in 350 oven until charred on all sides (between 45 min. to an hour typically). Continually baste and turn throughout cooking to ensure even charring. Once done, cut into bite-size chunks and serve with dipping sauce (I usually make two servings of sauce - one to baste and one to dip) and toothpicks.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Loaf frozen dough; thawed</li>
      <li>1 pound Turkey pastrami; sliced thin</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Smoked turkey; sliced thin</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Mozzarella cheese; sliced thin</li>
      <li>Spicy mustard</li>
      <li>Italian salad dressing</li>
      <li>Egg white</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll thawed dough into rectangle, approximately 15x20. Spread spicy mustard evenly over entire surface. Lay slices of turkey pastrami over entire surface, then a layer of cheese, then a layer of turkey. Sprinkle Italian dressing sporadically over turkey. Roll up rectangle, jelly roll style. Pinch to seal edges. Brush top surface with beaten egg white. Bake in preheated 350 F oven 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. If top browns too quickly, cover with aluminum foil. Cool slightly. Slice in 2 inch slices. NOTES : I make my own Italian dressing for this recipe, adding lots of spices including garlic (powder or roasted garlic paste), cilantro, basil, oregano, onion powder, oil, vinegar and mayonnaise. You may use any combination of sandwich slices or cheese. You may use pizza sauce, pizza toppings and mozzarella cheese. J: It took much longer to bake...maybe 40 minutes total.

      <li>4 cups (19 3/4 ounces) high-gluten (bread) flour</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoo ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons (4 ounces) unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 cup (4 ounces) pecan pieces, toasted</li>
      <li>1/2 cups (4 ounces) cold water</li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons Cornstarch</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Allow to stand for about 3 minutes. Add the honey, pumpkin puree, milk, egg yolks, cornmeal, and 1 2/3 cups (8 ounces) of the high-gluten flour to the yeast mixture. Stir briskly with a whisk until the ingredients are well combined. Let this sponge stand for at least 15 minutes but not longer than 30 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk the remaining 2 1/3 cups (11 3/4 ounces) high-gluten flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt together to mix well. Add to the sponge and stir with your fingers to incorporat e the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Knead the dough in the bowl until it becomes smooth and somewhat elastic, about 5 minutes. Gradually add the melted butter, kneading it in gently until well incorporated. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until it is very smooth, silky, and elastic, about 5 minutes. The dough will be sticky, so keep the work surface and your hands lightly floured, but don't overdo it. The dough should be soft, supple, and springy. Shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Flatten the dough and stretch it gently with your fingers to form a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the toasted pecans evenly over the rectangle. Fold the whole mass into an envelope and knead it gently until the nuts are well distributed, about 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading it. Some of the pecans may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise, when the dough has softened. Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, along with any loose pecans. Turn to coat the dough with oil, then cover the bowl tightly with oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature (75 degrees to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 2 hours. While the bread is rising, make a cornstarch wash: Put the cold water in a small saucepan and whisk in the cornstarch. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently until it thickens. Remove from the heat and cover to keep a skin from forming. Set aside to cool. When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the floured work surface, pressing in any loose nuts. Flour your hands lightly and gently divide the dough into 2 equal pieces (each weighing about 24 ounces). Shape each piece into a knot. Generously dust a peel or the bottom of a baking sheet with flour or coarse cornmeal. Carefully place the shaped loaves on the peel or sheet, leaving several inches between them so they won't grow into each other as they rise. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and allow it to rise at room temperature until it has just doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone. When the loaves have doubled, use a pastry brush to paint each loaf continued in part 2</li>

    <title>Authentic Southern Style Barbecued Ribs (Secret Recipe)</title>
    <category>Pork</category>
    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SECRET SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 Bottle ketchup, 32 ounce large size (Heinz is my favorite)</li>
      <li>2/3 small Jar prepared yellow mustard (ie. French's)</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 large Onion, chopped coarsely</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>2 large Lemons, sliced</li>
      <li>Tabasco hot sauce to taste (3 drops to 1/2 ts)</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper to taste (lots of it)</li>
      <li>No salt (plenty in the ketchup)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 1/2 day, but constant attention is not required. Simmer the sauce, stirring until the sugar is melted. Then, stir occasionally for a few minutes while the oil is drawn out of the lemon. Do not allow to scorch. Remove from heat and set aside. Broil the ribs flesh side up until browned. Turn and cook flesh side down, brown again. Now brush both sides with some of the sauce and cook on each side for five minutes. Do not let them burn or blacken! The RIBS at this point look good, but they are still raw. Cut the ribs apart and dip each rib in the sauce. Pile the ribs high on a full-sized oven broiler rack and pan, and pour any remaining sauce, less a cup or so, over the ribs. Cover the ribs with heavy-duty aluminium foil, tucking in around the outside edge of the pan to make an airtight container. Cook in the oven at 325F for 2 hours. Remove from oven and open very carefully. Beware the live steam that will rush out. Allow to sit, opened for a few minutes. The end result is smoked, steamed, tender meat which falls from the bones. All fat is rendered and drains into the pan. Use leftover sauce when warming over the second day. SAUCE VARIATION: Molasses, tomato paste, onion, spices Unfortunately I don't have anyplace to grill outdoors so can first part of the recipe (which calls for outdoor grilling) be substituted by putting the ribs in the oven? Rinse and dry ribs; then cut apart. Heat about 3 cups oil in a wok. When very hot, add ribs in small batches and fry until brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove and drain. [They are absolutely delicious at this point. Once I forgot to make the sauce until I was half done eating the ribs! They're great served at this point with various Chinese dips ++mustard with a dish of chopped scallions, hoisin sauce, chili sauces, etc. S.C.] Combine sugar, vinegar, salt and soy sauce. Remove oil from wok; return wok to stove and turn heat to high. When hot, add vinegar mixture. Cook, stirring, over high heat until syrupy. Add ribs; toss in the mixture until well coated. Serve warm or at room temperature. San Francisco Chronicle, date unknown... I have never tried that, but I suspect a compromise could be worked. Most of the actual cooking occurs during the oven portion. The purpose of the outdoor grilling is to both sear and seal the meat, and impart the unique flavor of barbecue to the ribs by exposing it to the smoke created when the drippings from the meat vaporize on the hot briquets. An additional (and desirable) flavor is also imparted to the meat if real charcoal briquets are used. The addition of the "Secret Sauce" during the last portion of the outdoor phase also contributes to the taste. As a non-outside alternative, I would suggest oven broiling of the ribs as a substitute for the outdoor searing. During the final portion, the coating of the slabs could still be done (the 5 minutes per side part). To possibly aid in giving a barbecue-like flavor, a drop or two of liquid smoke could be added **only** to the small portion of the sauce that is used to coat the ribs during the searing process. There's a possibility the time under the broiler may need to be shortened when compared with the outside method. Liquid smoke is a very potent ingredient, and I have never found it satisfactory for my own use. Obviously, some must, as it is still sold. As a rule of thumb, I would advise forgetting about the amount recommended for use on the bottle, and if in doubt, "use less". Then, following the oven broiling, you can continue by cutting the ribs apart, and continuing by the recipe. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; October 5 1992.

      <li>with the cornstarch wash. Brush gently so you won't deflate the loaves. (Reserve the remaining cornstarch wash.) Shake the peel or pan gently to be sure the loaves aren't sticking and slide the dough onto the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the door. After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer, mist the top and sides of the oven 6 to 8 times, then immediately shut the oven door. Repeat the misting procedure 1 minute later. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature 350 degrees F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves are golden brown and the surface feels firm but not hard when you press it lightly. These should have a thin soft crust, not a hard crunchy one. Transfer the loaves to a rack and paint them again with the cornstarch wash. Allow to cool completely before serving. This bread is best eaten the day it is baked, but it also freezes exceptionally well if you wrap it in alu minum foil and then a heavy duty plastic freezer bag. Thaw at room temperature before serving.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 large Purple eggplant</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 Limes or lemons; juice of</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Tehina; up to 1/3</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt; or to taste</li>
      <li>A few drops of liquid smoke extract; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>For garnish: whole parsley leaves with 1/4" of stem left on and sweet paprika (hot paprika or cayenne may be substituted). Roast eggplant over an open hardwood fire (in that case omit smoke extract) or on BBQ until skin is thoroughly charred and eggplant is totally soft (test with skewer). OR Roast eggplant in 500 degrees oven until totally soft through and through (test with skewer). Place roasted eggplant in a basin of cold water and remove every bit of skin. Put eggplant in colander to drain water away. In mortar, pound garlic with salt until reduced to a smooth paste. Place garlic-salt paste in food processor and add lime or lemon juice (I prefer lime), tehina and smoke extract if used. Process on continuous. If dressing coagulates (citric acid will do that to tehina), add JUST ENOUGH water, in a thin stream, until dressing reliquefies to a thick yet pourable texture (like heavy pancake batter). Place eggplant in shallow serving bowl. With 2 forks, shred the meat thoroughly. Do not process the eggplant in the food processor, as that completely ruins the texture, which should be somewhat stringy (but very very soft!). Blend in the dressing uniformly. Smooth surface of baba-ghannooj and decorate by sticking the parsley stem down in the b-g in a regular pattern. Sprinkle a little paprika between the "florets". You may also drizzle a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil in tiny pools here and there on the surface. Serve with warm Arabic bread, tomato wedges, spring onions, oil- or brine-cured olives (green or black) and cucumber pickles (NOT the sweet kind. Kosher dills work well).

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Avgolemono is easy to make and creates quit a stir at a formal dinner party. It is an almost ethereal sauce, light, foamy, and a beautiful pale yellow color. It is a great accompaniment to roasted meat or chicken, or poached fish, and it is heartily recommended for boiled artichokes. Add another cup of chicken stock and serve this as a perfect first course soup. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until lemon colored and frothy, then beat in the lemon juice until the mixture is very foamy. Whisk in the hot stock a little at a time until the sauce is light in color and foamy. Serve immediately. Yield: About 2 cups From The Complete Book Of Sauces by Sallie Y. Williams</li>

      <li>First, make a soft, rich custard: beat 4 egg yolks until light and pale yellow. Heat 2 cups light cream with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon orange flower water or vanilla. Add beaten egg yolks, while beating very hard. Then cook without boiling, stirring continuously until custard coats the spoon. Remove to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled. Cut a two-layer sponge cake (that you bake or buy) into finger-length pieces. Spread each one on one side with raspberry jam and quickly dip in 1/2 cup sherry. Place half these sponge fingers in the bottom of a deep cut-glass bowl. Cover with half the custard. Whip 2 cups cream. Sweeten with 1/2 cup icing sugar and vanilla to taste. Cover custard with half the whipped cream. Make a second layer on top of all this. Top with a dozen or so toasted almonds, standing them upright in the cream, add a few slivers of angelica - or use small roses instead of almonds and angelica. Refrigerate at least 12 hours. This beautiful dessert never fails to create a sensation, yet is easy to prepare. ~from The Best of Mme Jehane Benoit From: Sandee Eveland</li>

    <title>Authentic Barbecued Ribs Pt 2</title>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>produce enough heat to cook the ribs thoroughly. In cold weather, prepare for a longer cooking time. Depending on how cold it is, when you turn ribs at 1 1/2 hour point you'll probably need to add an additional 15 coals to keep cooking temperature more or less constant. To gauge how outside temperatures can affect cooking times, it takes 4 hours to cook ribs in 17 degree weather. Signs of doneness include meat starting to pull away from ribs (if you grab one end of an individual rib bone and twist it, the bone will actually turn a bit, separate from meat) and a distinct rosy glow on exterior. 7. If there is a secret to producing authentic barbecue-joint-style ribs at home, it is this step: Immediately after taking ribs off grill, completely wrap them in aluminum foil. Put foil-wrapped ribs in a brown paper sack, and fold sack over ribs. Allow to rest at room temperature for 1 hour or more. Although it's difficult to say exactly what happens inside that foil-wrapped, brown-paper-sacked package, whatever it is, is good. An unscientific guess is that the moist, enclosed heat allows some of the juices to return to the meat, further flavoring and tenderizing it. 8. Finally, heat up the sauce, unwrap the ribs, swab on the sauce, chop into individual ribs, and then chomp. Serve additional sauce passed separately for those who want it. Kentucky Smoked Barbecue Sauce: Follow instructions in step 3 for sauce using above ingredients but making the following changes: Increase lemon juice to 1/4 cup-, increase paprika to 2 teaspoons- add 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke with the lemon juice- dissolve 2 tablespoons firm-packed brown sugar in the vinegar' and add with the tomato sauce. Louisiana Sweet Barbecue Sauce: Follow instructions in step 3 for sauce using above ingredients but making the following changes: Increase vinegar to 6 tablespoons-, dissolve 1 tablespoon firm-packed brown sugar in the vinegar. Add it along with 1/4 cup molasses and 2 tablespoons sweet sherry when you add the tomato sauce. Spicy Rio Grande Barbecue Sauce: Follow instructions in step 3 for sauce using above ingredients but making the following changes: Increase garlic to 4 cloves-, increase lemon juice to 1/4 cup-, increase hot red pepper sauce to 1 teaspoon-, add 1 can (7 ounces) diced mild green chiles along with the lemon juice. For an even hotter sauce, add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Cook's Illustrated, July/Aug. 1994 Page 1 1. Credit: A. Cort Sinnes.

    <ingredient>
      <li>8 Cornish game hens (each about 1 lb)</li>
      <li>12 large Garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Oregano, dried</li>
      <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>Pepper (to taste)</li>
      <li>1 cup Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Olive oil</li>

      <li>1 cup Apricots, dried</li>
      <li>1 cup Green olives, pitted</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Capers (plus a bit of the juice)</li>
      <li>8 Bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup White wine, dry</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Italian parsley (chopped)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Clean hens well under cold water. Pat dry. In a large bowl, combine hens, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, vinegar, oil, prunes, apricots, olives, capers (with juice) and bay leaves. Cover and refrigerate overnight to marinate. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange game hens in 1 or 2 shallow roasting pans. Spoon all the marinade over the hens. Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar and pour wine around them. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, basting frequently, until golden. Juice should look clear when thigh is pricked with a fork. Transfer hens, fruit, olives and capers to a serving platter. Moisten with pan juices and sprinkle with parsley. Pass remaining pan juices in a sauce boat. NOTES: * Cornish game hens stewed in fruit and sugar -- I originally got this recipe from the Sunday magazine of the local paper. I served it last year for Christmas dinner, and it's very good. What's more, this recipe is easy: you just put everything in a bowl, marinate overnight, then bake until done! : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 1 hour cooking. : Precision: approximate measurement OK. : Nancy Mintz : UNIX System Development Lab, AT&amp;T-IS, Summit, NJ : ihnp4!attunix!nlm : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Stir in chocolate chips, nuts and bourbon until well mixed. Pour into pie shell. Bake at 375 degrees for 40-50 minutes. Be careful not to overbake.

The pork has to be barbecued - that is, cooked long and slow over a real wood fire, preferably hickory. Temp should be around 220 degrees, and it takes at least 1-1/2 hours per pound, or until internal temp. reaches 150-160 degrees. Needless to say, this is difficult to accomplish in the average backyard Weber kettle, although it can be done. It has to be served on a CWB: Cheap White Bun. After that, the only question is "with or without?" Sweet cole slaw on top, that is. MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #58 From the MasterCook recipe list.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 teaspoon Active dry yeast or 1/3 small cake (6 grams) fresh yeast</li>
      <li>1 Scant tsp. malt syrup</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Warm water</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Milk at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 cup (135 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This takes 2 days but is worth the wait. Makes 2 round loaves Starter Stir the yeast and malt into the water; let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the milk and beat in the flour with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon about 100 strokes until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand until bubbly, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight. Dough 2 cups water, at room temperature 6 1/4 cups (860 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 T. salt Cornmeal Mix the starter and the water in a mixer until the starter is well broken up. Add the flour and salt and mix for 2 to 3 minutes at low speed. The dough will be smooth but won't pull away from the side of the bowl. Change to the dough hook and knead at medium speed, scraping down the side of the bowl as necessary, until the dough is elastic but slightly sticky, 3 to 4 minutes. Finish kneading by hand on a floured work surface. First rise Place in a well-oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. The dough is ready when it is very bubbled and blistered. Shaping and second rise Cut the dough in half on a floured surface and shape into 2 round loaves. Place on an oiled cookie sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover and let rise till doubled, about 1 hour. Baking Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake about 1 hour and cool on racks. To get a really good crust spray the loaves with water 3 times in the first 15 minutes of baking. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CRUST</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>16 tablespoons (1/2 pound) unsalted butter (cold)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Cold water</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>1 cup Dried mission figs</li>
      <li>1 cup Dried calimyrna figs</li>
      <li>2 cups Cold water</li>
      <li>2 medium Apples</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Walnut pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Grated orange zest</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 large Egg; beaten, for brushing</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>CRUST: To begin the pie crust, combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Cut the butter into 1-inch cubes and cut them into the flour or mix them in with the paddle attachment of an electric mixer until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the water and toss gently to blend. Press the dough together. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. FILLING: With a small knife, remove the hard bit of stem at the tip of each fig. Place all the figs in a medium saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Reduce it to a simmer and cook until the figs are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain them, discarding the liquid, and set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Chop the cooled figs into 1/2-inch chunks. Peel, quarter, and core the apples; cut them into 1/2-inch pieces. Combine the fruits and walnuts in a large bowl. Blend the cinnamon, orange zest, and 1 tablespoon of sugar and sprinkle the mixture over the fruit; toss to blend evenly. Cut the chilled pie dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 13-inch circle. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one circle. Spoon the fruit mixture into the shell, gently pressing it into place. Brush the rim of the shell with beaten egg, and top the pie with the other circle of dough. Crimp the edges. Brush the top of the pie (but not the edges) lightly with water; sprinkle on the remaining tablespoon of sugar. Cut 4 small slashes in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Bake the pie on the lowest oven shelf for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375 F. Continue baking until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

ROLL about a third of each color dough into I0-inch ropes on a lightly floured surface. Twist ropes together; fold in crosswise and flatten slightly. Roll 1/8 inch thick (keep remaining dough refrigerated). Cut with leaf-shape cookie cutters . Place cutouts 1 inch apart on greased cookie sheets. Score veins with a table knife or skewer.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a small bowl whisk together mustard, vinegar, and lemon juice. Add garlic oil gradually, whisking constantly. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and set aside for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. 2. Trim broccoli and cut into florets (reserve stalks for soup, if desired). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat; add florets and cook until tender-crisp. Drain and immediately plunge into ice water. When cool, drain again and pat dry. Broccoli may be cooked up to 6 hours ahead, cooled, and stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. 3. Transfer broccoli to a large bowl along with tomatoes. Add dressing to vegetables and toss to coat well. Add green onion and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan and toss to blend. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer to a serving platter. Note: To make garlic oil, add 6 whole peeled garlic cloves to 1 pint extra virgin olive oil. Marinate at least 1 week before using. Oil will keep indefinitely if covered and refrigerated. Variation: Cauliflower may be substituted for all or part of the broccoli. Recipe By : The California Culinary Academy File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

Adding the seeds of 1 jalapeno chile will not make the jelly hotter since the sugar, the vinegar, and the cooking process tame (most) all the chiles. The floatin seeds in the jar add character. Using the knife blade of a processor, mince the peppers and chiles with quick on and off pulsations. In a 5 qt. pot, mix the peppers, chiles, seeds sugar and vinegar. Bring to a rolling boil and boil for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool for 5 minutes. Add the 6 ozs of pectin (certo) and stir continuously for 2 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool for another 2 minutes and the stir again for 1 minute. This stirring will distribute the bits of pepper throughout the jelly. Pour into jelly jars that have been strilized and seal immediatly with lids that have been sterilized seperatly for 5 minutes. Test seal, after cooling, with finger. If middle pops up when pressed, jar is not sealed. MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #85 From the MealMaster recipe list.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>6 pounds Pork spareribs.; see note in step 1 about 2 slabs for 6 lb total</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: BARBECUE-STYLE DRY RUB</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cayenne pepper powder; (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Mild chile powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cumin</li>

      <li>4 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; chopped</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic; minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice; (2 tbl. from 1 lemon)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Mustard powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Hot red pepper sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 can Tomato sauce; (16ozs)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Pick your ribs. The old-fashioned spareribs are best, not the baby back ribs, not the country-style ribs, just the plain old, under-three-pounds pork spareribs, in one big slab. If there is a large amount of extraneous fat on the ribs, trim it before cooking. 2. For the dry rub: At least an hour before cooking ribs, mix all dry rub ingredients together. (This dry rub is a fairly traditional combination of flavors. Feel free to adjust amounts, or to add or subtract ingredients.) This rub yields enough to coat about 4 slabs. Store leftover rub in an airtight jar or in freezer. Rub a generous amount (a scant 3 tablespoons) onto each side of ribs. Ribs can sit at room temperature for up to an hour-, wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate if you plan to hold them any longer. An hour is plenty of time for dry rub to flavor ribs. If you want the meat more intensely flavored, this step can be done the night before cooking. 3. Meanwhile, prepare barbecue sauce. Heat butter in medium saucepan. Add onions and garlic- saut6 until onions soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in next 6 ingredients- cook over medium heat to blend flavors, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar and tomato sauce, bring to simmer. Simmer uncovered until sauce thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. Set aside until ready to serve. 4. Start with a grill free of any leftover ashes or coals. Light 40 or so charcoal briquettes (if you're using a metal chimney starter, fill it approximately 2/3 full). Push all coals to one side of fire grate, arranged in a mound 2 or 3 briquettes high. Keep bottom vents of grill completely open. Coals will be just right when they are covered in a light gray ash. Meanwhile, wrap 2 large handfuls (about 2 cups) of hickory smoking chips in foil. Poke several holes in top of foil packet with a fork to let smoke escape. There's no real benefit to be had by soaking the chips first. 5. Once coals are ready, lay foil-wrapped smoking chips on top of charcoal. Put cooking grate in place. Position ribs on cooking grate opposite fire-, on a 22-inch kettle grill, you should be able to cook 2 full slabs of ribs, side by side, at one time. Put lid on grill, with top vents 2/3 open, directly over ribs. This will help draw heat and hickory smoke past the ribs. Initial heat inside grill will probably hover around 350 degrees. Over the 2-hour cooking period, it will drop a hundred degrees or so-all of which falls into the acceptable slow-cooking range. 6. Turn ribs every 30 minutes for a total cooking time of 2 to 3 hours. There is no need to baste the ribs with anything. In all but the most extreme of weather conditions, ribs will be done in 2 hours. In normal weather conditions (say, above 60 degrees) coals will begin to lose some of their vigor toward the end of the cooking time, but they still continued in part 2</li>

      <li>2/3 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Chinese white rice vinegar or cider vinegar</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>CUT THE PORK INTO 1-INCH cubes. Put the cubes into a bowl together with the rice wine or sherry, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the green and red peppers into 1-inch squares. Peel and cut the carrot and scallions into 1-inch chunks. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the carrots in it for 4 minutes; drain and set aside. Mix the egg and cornstarch in a bowl until they are well blended into a batter. Lift the pork cubes out of the marinade, put them into the batter and coat each piece well. Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or large wok until it is almost smoking. Remove the pork pieces from the batter with a slotted spoon, and deep-fry them. Drain the deep-fried pork cubes on paper towels. Combine the chicken stock, soy sauce, salt, vinegar, sugar and tomato paste in a large saucepan. Bring it to a boil. Add vegetables (not the lychees or oranges.) Stir well. In a small bowl, blend together the cornstarch and water. Stir this mixture into the sauce and bring it back to a boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer. Add the lychees or oranges and pork cubes. Mix well, and then turn the mixture onto a deep platter. Serve at once. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Lock the lid into place. Over high heat bring to high pressure. Lower the heat just enough to maintain the pressure at high and cook for 6 minutes. Reduce the pressure with a quick-release method. Remove the lid, tilting away from you to allow any steam to escape. (or simmer 25 min on stovetop until tender-soft) 3. Puree the soup in two batches in a blender (for a smoother texture), food mill, or food processor, adding salt to taste. 4. Return to the pot to rewarm and serve with a garnish of fresh coriander. (I found that this soup was much improved by adding a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice--it counteracts the sweetness nicely.)

      <li>Date: Mon, 4 Mar 1996 09:58:57 +0100 From: Sykes.Kaye@uniface.nl (Kaye Sykes) This was last night's dinner. Scrumptious! Although it takes about 45 min to prepare, there is a long period where there's nothing to do, so I think it's suitable for a work night. Shulman thinks it serves 4-6 people. We think 3 (generously) or 4 (or two for dinner and one for lunch.). Recipe By: Martha Rose Shulman's Main-Dish Salads Bring the water to a boil and add the rice. Add salt to taste, bring back to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 40 minutes, until the rice is tender. Drain and toss with the broccoli, nuts, and parsley. [Meanwhile, steam broccoli and chop nuts.] Mix together the lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, and yogurt. Whisk in the walnut oil and add salt and pepper. Toss with the rice mixture, correct the seasonings, and serve; or refrigerate until shortly before serving. Note: If the salad is to be refrigerated for a long time, add the broccoli and parsley shortly before serving to retain their bright color. [Shulman says this serves 4-6. We think 3-4.] MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MasterCook recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

      <li>Mix the fruit and vegetables together. Put into an preserving pan (Note: these books call for an aluminum pan - I just don't use aluminum with acid food ) Add the remaining ingredients, except the sugar. Simmer for about 30 minutes until tender. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. Simmer gently, stirring frequently, until thick. (Note: how long this takes depends on the water content of the fruits). Cool, then pack the chutney into clean jars. Cover and seal. PS: I always refrigerate after opening the jar. "Gathering the produce of the season as the days shorten, as the sun travels lower in the sky and the earth quietens, is a deeply satisfying pastime. Making the most of the produce is a pleasure, too, and this chutney brings several of the fruits of the season together in a mouthwatering way.

      <li>*** Slightly adapted for my use from Bread Machine Magic *** Place all ingredients except cornmeal in breadpan. Select dough setting and start. At beep, turn dough onto a floured countertop or cutting board. (I spray an acrylic board with Pam and skip the flour). Shape the dough into 12" oblong loaf, 1 large round loaf, 2 18-inch baguettes, or 8 french rolls. Dust the top with a little flour; rub it in. Place on a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm over 30 to 45 minutes of until doubled. To warm oven slightly, turn on warm setting for two minutes then turn it of Place a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 450~. Immediately before placing bread in oven, slash tops with a very sharp knife (I use a serratted knife) about 1/2" deep. Bake round or oblong loaves 20 minues, baguettes about 15 minutes, french rolls bake 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. This is best served within hours of baking. To preserve crisp crust, do not store in plastic wrap or bags. Posted to EAT-L Digest - 18 Jun Date: Wed, 19 Jun 1996 01:10:40 -0400 From: Kappie King &lt;Lestat6663@AOL.COM&gt;</li>

Rye flour - OK up to about 20% of flour but height lost Care of Yeast I purchase 500g of Instant Dried Yeast at a time. Fill 2 small coffee jars and store one sealed with glad wrap in the freezer. The other one is stored in the frig with a sealed plastic lid. When the first jar is finished, allow the second, frozen jar to reach frig temperature in the frig before use (to reduce the condensation). There is some small deterioration of the second jar towards the end of the batch. I increase the yeast used by up to 10% to counter this. The adjustment is made as a result of the previous loaf not being quite as high as usual. &gt;From: Jack Jordan &lt;jjord@adam.com.au&gt; From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe</li>

Add 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds to the batter, along with 1 cup of dark molasses, and 2 tablespoons of powdered cocoa. Substitute brown sugar for the plain sugar. Reduce water by 1/4 cup. RAISIN-CINNAMON: Add 2 slightly beaten eggs to the batter, after proofing. Roll each half of dough into a large rectangle. Sprinkle each rectangle with a mixture of, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon. Sprinkle each half with 1/2 cup of raisins. Carefully roll each rectangle as you would to shape a baguette. tuck the ends underneath the loaf. Allow to rise until doubled, do not split tops of loaves. After baking brush loaves with melted butter. GARLIC-CHEESE: Add 1 cup of grated parmesan cheese to batter. Mince 6 cloves of garlic, add to batter. After splitting tops of loaves, carefully pour 1 tablespoon of garlic butter on the top of each loaf. For a cheesier loaf, before rolling rectangle into baguette, sprinkle with 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Cut tomatoes in half, sprinkle with salt and place the tomatoes face down in a colander for half an hour or more. Now, gently squeeze out of the tomatoes as many seeds as you can, and then place the tomatoes in a large pan. Cover and simmer gently for a few minutes (5 to 10). DON'T STIR! Drain away the yellow "juice", because it is very sour. At this point, we use a special utensil to separate the pulp from the skin. Bring the pulp to the boil and pour it into glass jars while boiling - proceed carefully, to prevent jars from cracking, and fill up one jar at a time (the pan should stay on the stove, simmering gently, all the time). As an optional extra, you can add a few leaves of basil in each jar, before filling the jar with sauce. Cover each jar with its lid as soon as it's full (you'll have to act quickly, as in less than a minute the jar can get to a too high temp for you to touch it!). Place jars in a large cardboard box, wrapping each jar in rags (preferably woolen). Store the jars close together in the box and let them stand overnight (24 hours at least). Don't be surprised if you find that the jars, when you open the box after 24 hours, are still hot: this is the best sterilizing method I know! This is the way we make our tomato sauce for "winter storage". It keeps for at least one year. You can use this basic sauce as a base for any kind of spaghetti sauce. As it has a very natural tomato flavour, it's also perfect for stews, soups, pizza, and all sorts of other tomato based preparations.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Fish; about 1/2 pound per serving</li>
      <li>Shredded scallions and chinese parsley for garnish</li>
      <li>Topping; see "Steamed Fish Topping Mixtures" for list of ingredients</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Have fish cleaned and scaled, but left whole. Rinse in cold water. Dry well with paper toweling; then rub lightly with salt, inside and out. Place in a shallow heatproof dish. (If fish is too large, cut it in two.) 2. Prepare any of the topping mixtures (see "Steamed Fish Topping Mixtures") and spread over fish. 3. Steam until done (see "How-to Section"). (Allow about 30 minutes for a 2-1/2 pound fish; 20 minutes for a 1-1/2 pound fish; 15 minutes for a 3/4-inch thick fish steak; and 7 to 10 minutes for a thinly sliced or flatfish.) 4. Garnish fish with shredded scallions and Chinese parsley. Serve immediately. VARIATIONS: 1. In step 3, during the last 10 minutes of steaming, top whole fish with several clams in their shells (scrub them clean first). The shells will open when steamed. 2. In step 3, steam 2 cakes of bean curd, sliced or cubed, with the fish. 3. Steam the fish, topped only with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 slices fresh ginger root and 1 scallion, both shredded. Then heat 1/4 cup peanut oil to smoking and pour over fish. Sprinkle immediately with 3 tablespoons soy sauce and serve at once, garnished with shredded scallion. 4. Steam the fish, topped with a mixture of 2 tablespoons sherry, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon ginger juice. Then serve with a Five Willow or sweet-and-pungent sauce poured over (see "Sweet-and-Pungent Sauce" recipes). From &lt;The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook&gt;, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.

    <title>Basic Soda Bread (Farl)</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Cake or All-purpose Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Granulated Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Bicarbonate of Soda</li>
      <li>8 ounces Buttermilk; (up to 10)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Yesterday we introduced the members of Recipe-a-Day to Soda Bread as prepared in cake form. Today is the same recipe, but prepared as the farl. This type of preparation is found more often in Northern Ireland and served as a part of a traditional Irish Breakfast, or Ulster Fry is you prefer. Sift the dry ingredients together several times in a large mixing bowl to make sure the bicarbonate of soda is evenly distributed. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and a pour about three-quarters of the buttermilk into the center and start stirring. Continue to mix until you achieve a dough that is raggy and very soft. Add more buttermilk sparingly is you need it, as local conditions of humidity and temperature greatly impact the mixture. Blend quickly, but not too energetically until the whole mass of dough has become a floury, raggy consistency. Turn the contents of the bowl out onto a lightly floured surface and start to knead the bread. Your primary concern is speed in kneading. The chemical reaction of the bicarbonate of soda with the acidic buttermilk starts as soon as they meet. You need to get the Soda Bread into the oven while the reactions running high, so don't over knead. Spend about 30-seconds kneading the dough and shape the bread into a slightly domed circle about 6 to 8-inches in diameter. Cut the circle of dough into four equal sections and try not to crush or compress the dough when you make the cuts. A clean slicing motion with a sharp knife is required. To complete the farl prepare your best cast iron griddle or fry pan for cooking. Pre-heat the pan over a medium-low setting. Dust a hot griddle or frying pan with a little flour, and place the farl or farls gently on the hot griddle. The cut edges should be 1/2 inch or so apart to allow for expansion during cooking. Grill or fry the farls about 20-minutes on each side until well toasted in color. The farls will scorch easily, so keep an eye on the heat and adjust accordingly. The heat source should be very low when the farls are finished. Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by The Cook &amp; Kitchen Staff &lt;dailyrecipe-owner@recipe-a-day.com&gt; on Mar 04, 1998</li>

    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Soft lettuce leaves; (Boston or similar, not (iceberg)</li>
      <li>1 cup Fresh mint leaves</li>
      <li>1 cup Fresh coriander (Chinese parsley)</li>
      <li>1 cup Cucumber *</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* peeled in lengthwise strips and with green strips in between, then cut in half lengthwise and into thin horizontal slices, forming semi-circles. A salad or vegetable platter is a very important part of a Vietnamese meal; indeed, it is served at practically every one. The vegetables, which are eaten along with many dishe, are arranged on a platter, and diner helps himself to whatever he desires. In Vietnam we used many more vegetables and herbs than we can find in the West. But, in spite of that, the following platter makes a satisfactory accompaniment to the dishes we have prepared for this book. All vegetables and herbs are those served in Vietnam, except that the variety is smaller. Arrange a mound of lettuce in the center of a platter. Around the lettuce, and touching it, arrange separate mounds of mint and coriander. Arrange the cucumbers in overlapping slices around the complete outer rim of the platter. This is the basic arrangement of the vegetable platter. On those occasions when a recipe calls for another vegetable, it can be added to this platter. Makes 8 servings.

    <title>Basic Sweet Dough</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Very warm water (105 F to 115F)</li>
      <li>2 packages Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Instant nonfat dry milk (in dry form)</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Lightly salted butter or margarine, at room</li>
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>5 cups All-purpose flour (up to 5 1/4 cups)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Let stand for 2 minutes. Add the dry milk, eggs, butter, salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Mix until smooth, then beat for 2 minutes. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface (using some of the remaining flour) and knead for 6 to 8 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding only as much flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking. Place the dough in a greased bowl; turn once to bring the greased side up. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Use this Basic Sweet Dough to make: Cinnamon Twist Scandinavian Almond Ring Honey Almond Twist A delicate, not-too-sweet dough that lends itself admirably to toppings and fillings made of fruits, nuts, and spices. It can be shaped into twists, rolls, rings, and braids. Each of the accompanying recipes calls for half a recipe of the dough. Double the filling if you wish to make two coffecakes, or make two different coffeecakes from one batch of dough. Either way, you can freeze one to use later.

The first measurement, if you are going to use the egg white, put it in the measuring cup first then measure your 1 1/4 C water or milk.

      <li>2 packages Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Warm water</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Molasses or brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt 8 c unbleached all-purpose flour (approximately)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a saucepan, heat the milk and butter over a low flame until the milk is scalded (brought just short of boiling). Set aside to cool. If quick cooling is necessary, fill a bowl with ice water and set the saucepan inside, stirring milk mixture until lukewarm, no cooler. (baby bottle temperature.) In a mixing bowl, dissolve the sugar and yeast in the water. Set in a warm place for 20 minutes, until a sponge is formed. Add the milk, eggs, molasses or brown sugar, and salt, and mix. Add flour a cup at a time until dough is stiff enough to work by hand. Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until elastic (until dough stops coming off on your hands!) Grease the inside of a large bowl, put the dough in, then turn the dough to coat the top with grease. Cover bowl with a wet tea towel (not dripping, just wet!) and set in a warm place to rise for about an hour or until double. (If you have a gas oven with a pilot, this is perfect. So is the top of the refrigerator.) Punch the dough down, knead it briefly, then re-cover it in the bowl and set it aside to rise for another hour. Punch the dough down again, knead it for about a minute, then divide it into three equal parts. Form each portion into a loaf, and place into a greased loaf pan (if you made a seam in the loaves when forming them, place the seam at the bottom.) Cover with a moist towel and let the loaves rise about 45 minutes, until the tops of the loaves are just above the top edge of the pans. After 30 minutes of this rising, preheat the oven to 375 degrees (350 for glass pans). For a chewier top crust, you can brush on a mixture of one beaten egg and a Tablespoon of water before placing the loaves in the oven. (for a moister crust, bake plain, then rub a stick of butter over the hot loaves until the top crust is lightly coated as the loaves are cooling on a rack.) Bake the loaves for 35-40 minutes. The crust should be golden brown, and the loaves will sound hollow when rapped with a knuckle. Remove from pans immediately and place on wire racks to cool. Cool completely before storing in any airtight container. * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627 Posted by FAYLEN Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #702 by Lisa Clarke &lt;lisa@gaf.com&gt; on Aug 1, 9</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: BASIC</li>
      <li>2 quarts Cold water</li>
      <li>1 Med. onion, (see note)</li>
      <li>1 Large clove garlic (note)</li>
      <li>Bones, excess meat (notes)</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOWL AND GAME STOCKS</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Backs, necks, bones (notes)</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK</li>
      <li>2 pounds Beef shank (see notes)</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: PORK STOCK</li>
      <li>2 pounds Pork neck bones (see notes)</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SEAFOOD STOCK</li>
      <li>2 pounds Rinsed shrimp heads (notes)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Notes: To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from the recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and celery. The recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and quartered. Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers) from meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in the recipe(s) you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2 pounds backs, necks and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc. FOR BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds beef shank (preferred) or other beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones (preferred) or other pork bones. FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds rinsed shrimp heads and/or shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab shells (2-1/2 to 3 quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills removed), or any combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster liquor for all or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If desired, you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until thoroughly browned. Then use them to make your basic stock. (When you brown the bones and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on the surface, which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it dissolves in the stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to cover the other stock ingredients. Place all ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours, preferably 8 (unless directed otherwise in a recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep about 1 quart of liquid in the pan. The pot may be uncovered, or set the lid on it askew. Strain, cool and refrigerate until ready to use. (Note: Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20 to 30 minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO MAKE A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering until evaporation reduces the liquid by half or more. For example, if your recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2 cups of strained basic stock. (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce requires lots of taste but only a limited amount of liquid, for example, "Oyster Sauce for Beef."

In a glass or ceramic bowl that has been scalded, place flour, yeast and sugar; add lukewarm potato water and stir in well. Cover with plastic wrap and pierce with fork to release gases. Place in a warm, draft-free location at an even 85F for 2 days; stir several times daily. (do not let sourdough starter rise above 95F because higher temp are favorable to less desireable microorganisms) Refrigerate until ready to use. Replenish with one c flour and 3/4 c water and let stand overnight or 12 hrs in a warm location before refrigerating again. When replenishing, add lukewarm water with flour. Starter should be at room temp when using in recipes, always after having stood 12 hrs from addition of replenishing flour and water. At least 1 c should remain to refrigerate.

Shake vigorously to mix oil and vinegar before using some on a salad. I prefer to add salt to the salad itself at the last minute rather than include it in the dressing. Somehow that tastes batter to me. This will keep for at least a month, gradually changing character so that each salad is a little different than the last. If it gets a little heavy on the vinegar with use, add a bit more olive oil late in the game. Ron from Minnesota, USA where olive trees are rare indeed.

Use dough cycle, which will knead the dougha nd allow it to rise one time. It is not necessary to let dough any longer that 1 hour. If your machine has a double kneading dough cycle (DAK And Welbilt ABM 100), remove the dough after 1 hour or so and turn off your machine. Allowing the dough to knead the second time causes bubbles which are difficult to roll. Either acative dry or rapid rise yeast may be used.

      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 cup Tomato juice</li>
      <li>2 Potatoes; medium size</li>
      <li>3 Carrots; diced</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt; or to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Use about 6 cups liquid. You may mix chicken and beef broth (canned lowfat, not bouillon cubes) with water and tomato juice or vegetable juice cocktail to suit your tastes. 1. Melt 4 tablespoons margarine in skillet. Add the chopped green peppers, carrots, celery and onion. Saute on low heat until vegetables are softened and onion browned lightly. Add this to the broth mixture which has been placed in a large, heavy pan with lid. 2. Add to this the potatoes, green beans, lima beans and corn. Cover and simmer for about 45 minutes or until all the vegetables are done. Add the salt and pepper. 3. Remove about 2 cups of the mixture and put into blender. Puree this mixture and return to pot with rest of soup. Turn off heat and cover soup. Best if allowed to set for up to 1 hour to blend flavors. Since this is a basic recipe for soup, you can add the vegetables you prefer and follow the directions above to finish the soup. Some suggestions: Add bay leaf, shredded cabbage, chopped zucchini, diced turnips, fresh tomatoes, okra or parsley. For added nutrition, serve with a sprinkling of lowfat cheese on the hot soup. Also good sprinkled with toasted croutons. This stores very well in refrigerator and is actually improved with time.

    <title>Basic Tamale Dough</title>
    <category>Mexican</category>
    <category>Chef du jou</category>
    <category>Zarela mart</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 pounds Fresh masa (ask for coarsely ground) or 4 1/2 cups masa harina and 4 to 5 cups warm caldo de pollo plus more as needed</li>
      <li>1 pound Lard (non-hydrogenated; no preservatives)</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>If using fresh Masa, set aside. If using Masa Harina, place it in a large bowl and reconstitute by adding 4 cups warm stock. Beat with a wooden spoon or mix with your hands until you have a stiff, smooth dough like a medium-pliable bread dough. Use a little more stock if necessary, but the mixture should not be loose. Beat the lard in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until very fluffy and fully aerated, about 3 minutes. It may take longer if your mixer is not powerful (a heavy-duty machine such as a Kitchen Aid is best). The best alternative to a mixer is not a spoon but your bare hand; whip and beat the lard with a rapid folding motion until you feel it lightening, and continue to whip until it is fluffy and full of air. It should be as light as butter creamed for the lightest butter cake. Still mixing on medium speed, begin adding the Masa, a handful at a time. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as necessary. Alternatively, beat in the Masa using your bare ha nd as a whipping and folding tool. If the mixture becomes too stiff to beat, add up to 1 cup tepid chicken or pork stock, a little at a time. When all the Masa has been incorporated, the mixture should be very light and delicate, the texture of buttercream frosting. Beat in the salt. The mixture is now ready to be spread onto corn husks, banana leaves, or other wrappers and steamed Recipe by: CHEF DU JOUR ZARELA MARTINEZ SHOW #DJ9159 Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 261 by Peg Baldassari &lt;Baldassari@compuserve.com&gt; on Nov 16, 1997</li>

    <title>Basic Tamales</title>

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>24 Dried corn husks</li>
      <li>1 cup Lard</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Masa harina mix</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Warm pork or poultry broth filling (turkey in green mole sauce or pork in red tomato sauce--see recipes)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a simplified recipe for tamales but they still should have a fairly authentic taste. To soak corn husks, cover with warm water; weigh down. Let soak at least 3 hours or overnight. For tamale dough: Beat lard and salt until fluffy. Slowly beat in masa harina mix alternately with broth until very light and fluffy. To assemble tamales: Drain corn husks, pat dry. Spread 2 tablespoons dough on center of husks forming a 3 x 2-inch rectangle and spreading copletely to right edge. Spoon 1 tablespoon filling lengthwise down center of rectangle. For fillings, see recipes "Turkey in green mole sauce" or "Pork in red tomato sauce". To enclose tamales, turn right side over to center of filling; fold left side over filling, allowing plain part of husk to wrap around filling. Fold top end down over bottom end. Secure ends by tying a string around center of tamale. To steam tamales, place a rack 2 inches above gently boiling water in steamer or 4-quart dutch oven. Stack tamales, folded side down, on rack. Cover, steam about 2 hours or until done. To test for doneness, remove one tamale from center and one from side of steamer. Open husks; tamales should be firm and come away easily from husk.

      <li>1 Egg white; frothed with fork for glaze</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with dough hook, put remaining bread ingredients into bowl. Turn machine on and slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If dough is too sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon, working it in before adding more. If dough is dry and crumbly, add more water by the teaspoon, working it in before adding more. Once desired consistency is achieved (moist but not too sticky), mix dough until well-kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in food processor, or 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put ingredients into large bowl and make well in center. Pour yeast mixture into well and work into ingredients in bowl, then knead on floured board until dough is elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal top. Place in bowl. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1-to-1 1/2 hours. Oil 8-cup-capacity bread pan (9-inch). Punch dough down and shape to fit pan. Cover loosely with plastic. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. 15 minutes before baking, put rack in center of oven; set oven at 375F. When dough has doubled, brush top with egg white. Bake until loaf is golden and sounds hollow when rapped on bottom, about 35 minutes.

      <li>2 tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Cut each bean curd cake in 6 to 8 pieces or in 1-inch cubes. Cut scallion stalk in 1-inch sections. 2. Heat oil. Add salt; then scallion, and stir-fry a few times until translucent. Add bean curd; stir-fry gently until heated through (2 to 3 minutes). 3. Sprinkle with soy sauce and remaining salt and stir in gently. NOTE: Since bean curd is fragile, vigorous stir-frying will demolish it. Therefore shake or tilt the pan from time to time to baste the bean curd with hot oil; or else separately turn the pieces so they can heat through evenly. VARIATIONS: 1. For the soy sauce, substitute oyster sauce. 2. Use 4 or 5 whole scallions, cut in 1-inch lengths. 3. Before serving, sprinkle bean curd with a few drops of sesame oil; or garnish with minced raw scallion. 4. With Chinese sausage: Steam 4 Chinese sausages 15 minutes; then slice thin. Add to heated oil in step 2 and brown lightly; then stir-fry scallion and bean curd. 5. With mushrooms (fresh): In step 2, add after the scallion, 1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced, and stir-fry until slightly softened. Then add the bean curd and continue as in steps 2 and 3. 6. With mushrooms (dried): After step 2, add 10 dried black mushrooms (soaked), sliced, the soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Then gently stir in 1/2 cup of the mushroom-soaking liquid or stock. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, 5 minutes over medium heat. 7. With roast pork: In step 2, add after the scallion, 1/4 cup roast pork, sliced or diced, and stir-fry a few times. Then add the bean curd and continue as in steps 2 and 3. 8. With shrimp: In step 2, add after the scallion 1/4 cup raw shrimp, shelled, deveined and cut in 1-inch pieces; stir-fry until pinkish.

    <quantity>7</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>15 ounces Cooked soybeans; rinsed and drained (from 1-1/2 to 2 cups), *see tip</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Mashed tofu; *see tip</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 large Garlic clove; may be doubled</li>
      <li>1 cup Minced onion</li>
      <li>2 Scallions; minced</li>
      <li>Parsley; a handful</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Minced fresh dill weed; (2 to 3 tbs)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dry mustard</li>
      <li>2 cups Fine dry breadcrumbs; *see tip</li>
      <li>Substitute: cooked short-grain brown rice</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil; for the pan</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place everything except the bread crumbs (or rice) and cooking oil in a food processor and puree until fairly smooth. Transfer to a bowl and add the bread crumbs or rice. Stir until well combined. Form into patties about 4 inches in diameter and l/2 inch thick, using about 1/2 cup of the mixture for each patty. Heat a heavy nonstick skillet and brush with oil. When the pan is hot, add the burgers, turn the heat down to medium, and cook for about 10 minutes on each side. Watch them carefully so they get nice and brown, but don't burn. Serve hot, in burger style (see notes.) Yield: 6 to 8 4-inch burgers. Preparations time: 30 minutes after the soybeans are cooked (10 minutes of work). BOOKs NOTEs: "Don't Knock 'Em Till you Try 'Em" -- You can buy many types of veggie burgers" these days, but just in case you'd prefer to make them yourself, here is the onginal concept. These simple, good, inexpensive burgers can be assembled and sauteed in just 30 minutes so it's not nearly as much work as it might seem. Serve Soyburgers with or without toasted buns, accompanied by the traditional burger trimmings -- mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, onion, tomato, pickles, etc. You can freeze the uncooked patties. Just wrap each burger in plastic wrap, then store all the individually wrapped patties together in a sealed plastic bag in the freezer. You can defrost one at a time, as needed, and saute to order. TIP: * Soak and cook dried soybeans ahead of time (see package for directions), or buy canned soybeans in a natural foods store. * Soyburgers can be made with bread crumbs or with cooked short grain brown rice. With rice, you have a wheat-free option, and the burger will come out crumblier, but crunchier. With bread crumbs. they hold together better The burgers taste great both ways. If you re using rice, cook it in advance and allow to cool. *MC-PER SERVING (1/7): 243 CAL, 7.6g fat (27.4% cff); 48.6% from carbs; 23.9% from protein, Estimated using nutritional values of Mori-Nu Soft Tofu. &gt;Untested recipe edited by Pat Hanneman (kitpath) for Mollie Katzen fans. 1998-Feb Recipe by: Mollie Katzen's Vegetable Heaven (1997) Posted to EAT-LF Digest by KitPATh &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; on Feb 23, 1998</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large bowl, beat the shortening and margarine with an electric mixer at medium to high spped for about 30 seconds, or until softened. Add about half of the flour and all of the remaining ingredients and beat until thoroughly combined, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. Beat or stir in the remaining flour. Divide the dough in half. Cover and chill for 1 to 2 hours or until easy to handle. Roll each portion of the dough to 1/8 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut into the desired shapes. Place 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. If desired, sprinkle with candies or colord sugar before baking. Bake in a 375 F oven for 7 to 9 minutes or until the edges are firm and the bottoms are very lightly browned. Remove the cookies and cool on a rack. Makes 3 to 4 dozen cookies. CHOCOLATE SUGAR COOKIES: Stir 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder into one half of the recipe. Bake as directed. NOTE: Sugar cookies also make attractive and economical ornaments. Make the dough according to the recipe then flatten the cut out cookies slightly with the bottom of a small glass dipped in sugar. Use a drinking straw to make a sharp, small hole near the top. If the hole begins to close during baking, use the straw to re-form the hole. [The Baltimore Sun; Dec 11, 1991] Posted by Fred Peters.

      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Flour</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Commercial buttermilk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sourdough starters can be purchased commercially or they can be started on your own. Your own might be more fun. One cup of water is mixed with 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 cup flour, and 4 tablespoons commercial buttermilk. Mix all of this together and place it in a glass or stainless-steel bowl. Do not use aluminum. Cover this with a towel and allow to stand in a warm place for a few days, or until it has begun to ferment and has a wonderful sour smell. You might keep this on the top of the water heater or in your oven and leave the light on all the time. The starter should be the consistency of pancake batter and it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator. Use this as your starter in any of the recipes that follow. The old-timers claim that you can get a sourdough starter going by just mixing flour and water together and allowing it to sit in a warm place for several days. This may work, but it is not terribly reliable. HINT: ON STORING SOURDOUGH STARTER. When storing sourdough starter in the refrigerator, remember that it should be kept at around 42Ã¸. If it is too cold, it will take a long time to come around again, to come back to life. Your refrigerator is probably colder than this, so perhaps you may want to store the starter in a very cool place. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

    <recipetext>
      <li>"Seasoned Greetings" -- From the L.A. Times. The most important ingredients in chili are the spices, and many cooks jealously guard their special blends. But there is a way you can give away your chili recipe without giving away the whole thing. Bottle your seasonings and attach the recipe--without the spice instructions. Tell them that information is too hot to handle. If you don't have a favorite spice mix or chili recipe, you can borrow ours. Chili powder comes in more varieties than basic red. In the Latino sections of most supermarkets, you can find ground chiles from different kinds of peppers, including pasilla and California chiles. Combine cumin, pasilla and California chile powders, salt, basil, oregano, dry mustard, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Mix well. 2 cups.

      <li>Saute the onion and garlic together in the fat until they are soft and golden, stop before they begin to brown. Add the rest of the ingredients and cook slowly for about 10 minutes. Spray a cookie sheet or other flat pan with a nonstick spray. Spread the mixture out in as thin a layer as possible - use two pans if necessary. Dry the sauce in the oven at 140 degrees F for about 6 hours with the door propped open a crack. Do not overdry or the reconstituted sauce will taste burned. Roll it up like fruit leather, and put into a plastic bag labled "Tomato Sauce." To reconstitute, add triple the amount of water to the dried sauce, bring to a boil, and simmer five minutes. Will feed six with pasta.</li>

      <li>1 package Yeast; active, dry</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Water; warm (110-115 degs)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Sugar</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>James Beard's Basic White Bread Makes 1 large loaf or 2 small loaves * Making basic white bread dough * In a small bowl mix the yeast and the 1/4 cup warm water; add the sugar, stir well, and set aside until proofed. It is proofed when fermentation is apparent: the mixture will swell and small bubbles appear on the surface. (If it doesn't proof at all, it means the yeast is not fresh.) In a small saucepan heat the milk with the salt and stir in the butter until it melts. Set aside to cool until it is no warmer than the yeast mixture. Put 2 cups of the flour in a large mixing bowl and stir in the milk mixture. Beat well with a wooden spatula, add the yeast mixture, and continue beating the dough until it is smooth, adding an additional cup of flour to make a firm dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and begin the kneading process, which evenly distributes the fermenting yeast cells through the dough. * Kneading Instructions * There are several kneading methods, but the basic one is to flour the dough and your hand lightly, then push the heel of your hand down into the dough and away from you. Fold the dough over, give it a quarter turn, and push down again. Repeat pushing, folding and turning until the motion becomes rhythmic. Knead for about 10 minutes, kneading in additional flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky, and blisters form on the surface. To test whether the dough has been kneaded enough make an indention in it with your fingers; it should spring back. If blisters form on the surface of the dough and break, this is another sign that the kneading is sufficient. * Note: If you have a heavy-duty electric mixer with a dough-hook attachment, knead the dough with the hook and finish it off on the board. Butter a large bowl, transfer the dough to it, and turn the bowl until the dough is well coated with butter on all sides. Cover the dough with a dish towel and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, until it is doubled in bulk. A good, warm, draft-free place is inside your room temperature oven. To test further if the dough has risen properly, make an indentation in it with two fingers: if the dough does not spring back, then it is ready. * Baking Preparations * Butter a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan, or two pans that are about 8x4x2 inches. Punch the dough down with your fist to deflate it; transfer it to a floured board and knead it well for about 3 minutes. Pat it into a smooth round or oval shape and let it rest for 4 to 5 minutes. Then form into 1 large or two small loaves, by shaping the dough into an oval the length of your bread pan, then gently stretching, rounding, and plumping it in the palms of your hands, tucking the edges underneath and pinching them together. Lift carefully; drop the dough into the pan or pans and smooth out. Cover the dough with a towel and let it rise again in a warm draft-free place for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until it is double in bulk. Preheat the oven to 400dF. Brush the egg wash over the top of the dough. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes; reduce the heat to 350dF and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the crust is well browned and the bread sounds hollow when removed from the pan and tapped on the bottom with the knuckles. If you like a crusty loaf, remove it from the pan about 5 to 10 minutes before the end of the baking time and let it finish baking on the oven rack. It will get brown and crusty all over. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a rack before slicing. The bread may be stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator after it has cooled. If you seal it in a bag before it is completely cooled, the crust will become soft. Stored bread will keep about 1 week. It also freezes well if wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and sealed in a plastic bag and can be kept for up to 3 months.</li>

      <li>Mix milk, butter, sugar, yeast together and put in the mixer bowl. Let sit till yeast proofs. Add eggs, salt then flour. Add slowly and at low speed or more flour will be on you and your cabinets then in the bread. Add enough to make the dough glossy ,but not too sticky. Let rest for 5 min. ~Leave dough in mixer- Then knead[ adding flour as needed] again for 1-3 minutes at setting 3or4. Put bowl in warm area until doubles, punch down good an knead it a bit, Let it double again. Punch down and put onto a floured table ( lightly). Knead -ading flour to dough as needed) form into 2 loaves or rolls. Bake at 350-f for an Hour. Knock on the loafe it will sound hollow. &gt;From this you can just about do anything. Add a cup of leftover cereal or a combination of such use Molasses for sugar and you have Anadama Bread. Add 1/2 cup of Chopped tomatoes and 1 tsp. of oregano, basil you've got Tomato Herb bread. A nice change from garlic bread for Spaghetti. The trick togood bread making is the flour and kneading. Any "wet" addtion to recipe will need a increase of flour. Kneading- flour should be added but only enough to make the dough resilent to touch. Experiment it's FUN!

    <title>Basic Soda Bread</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Cake or All-purpose Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Granulated Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Bicarbonate of Soda</li>
      <li>8 ounces Buttermilk; (up to 10)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Two main factors have long affected the historic course of Irish bread making. The first is related to the climate, in that this land is greatly influenced by the gulf Stream to the extent that it is neither hot in the summer nor cold in the winter. Hence, the forty shades of green and the fact that traditional hard wheats utilized in bread baking do not grow well. At least in the last millennium, Ireland has been relatively plentiful in fuel for baking. Various medieval overlords of Ireland were never able to exercise tight control over the forest land so firewood could be freely poached. As a result, anyone with a hearthstone could afford to bake on a small scale. In Ireland plain soda bread is as likely to be served as a accompaniment to a main meal in order to soak up the gravy as it's likely to appear with the breakfast in a fry. Soda bread comes in white or brown varieties and is served as a cake or a farl, based on regional differences. We'll being including all the various Soda Bread variations during our All-Irish Cooking month at Recipe-a-Day! Sift the dry ingredients together several times in a large mixing bowl to make sure the bicarbonate of soda is evenly distributed. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and a pour about three-quarters of the buttermilk into the center and start stirring. Continue to mix until you achieve a dough that is raggy and very soft. Add more buttermilk sparingly is you need it, as local conditions of humidity and temperature greatly impact the mixture. Blend quickly, but not too energetically until the whole mass of dough has become a floury, raggy consistency. Turn the contents of the bowl out onto a lightly floured surface and start to knead the bread. Your primary concern is speed in kneading. The chemical reaction of the bicarbonate of soda with the acidic buttermilk starts as soon as they meet. You need to get the Soda Bread into the oven while the reactions running high, so don't over knead. Spend about 30-seconds kneading the dough and shape the bread into a slightly domed circle about 6 to 8-inches in diameter. Place the dough on a baking sheet that has been lightly dusted with flour and use a sharp knife to cut across the circle making sure the cut goes about halfway down through the sides of the circle of dough so that it will flower properly. Bake for about 10-minutes in a 350-F to 400-F Degree pre-heated oven, then decrease the heat and continue to bake another 30 to 35-minutes until you can tap the loaf and a hallowish sound is produced. For a crunchy crust place the cooked cake on the rack to cool. For a softer crust, wrap the cake in a clean dishcloth and store as soon as itâs out of the oven. Either way, the soda bread is wonderful sliced or split and served hot with sweet butter and the jelly or jam of your choice.

    <title>Basic Venison Stock</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>5 pounds Bones, cut or chopped small</li>
      <li>2 pounds Meat cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions, chopped into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 medium Carrots, diced small</li>
      <li>5 Ribs celery, diced small</li>
      <li>1 cup Dry red wine (or 1 cup apple juice)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 gallons Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Thyme</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Juniper berries (optional)</li>
      <li>2 Bay leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Tomato paste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>yields about 1 gallon Method: Roast bones and meat on a rack in a roasting pan at 400 degrees until well browned - about 40 minutes. Put celery, carrot and onion on top of meat and brown also, another 15 minutes. When browned, discard fat in the pan and put bones, meat, vegetables in a pot large enough to hold everything. Put roasting pan on a stovetop burner over medium heat, pour wine into pan and deglaze, scraping any browned residue off pan and add to stock pot. Add water, covering the solids, and remaining ingredients. Bring to a gentle boil then cover and reduce heat to a very slow simmer for at least six hours, skimming occasionally. Uncover and simmer for four more hours or until reduced to a gallon of liquid. Strain, discarding solids and cool, uncovered. Cover when fully chilled (and not before or it may sour). To make larger batches, just multiply everything except thyme, juniper and bay. For each doubling of all the other ingredients, multiply them by 1 1/2 or they'll be too strong. That's the basic stock from which we'll make these two sauces. The first one is rich; a good sauce to put on venison no matter how you've cooked it. The second is the fullest taste of venison you're ever likely to find, with a very deeply concentrated flavor. This first sauce, Venison Espagnole, is what's called "a thickened reduction" and the second, Venison Demi-Glace, begins with the first and more of the stock, then goes to a yet further reduction. In each case, flavor is more intensified and developed than in the stages before.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Tue, 07 May 1996 10:55:21 -0400 From: theservs@gate.net (Thomas E. Haug) QUICK MIX METHOD: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Heat milk, water, and 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan over low heat until very warm (120 to 130F). Add liquid to flour mixture; beat on high speed of elec- tric mixer until smooth, about 3 minutes. Gradually stir in more flour to make a soft dough. Tum onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (5 to 10 minutes). Cover dough with bowl or pan; let rest 20 minutes. For two loaves, divide dough in half and roll out two 14x7-inch rectangles; for one loaf roll out to 16x8-inch rectangle. Roll up from narrow side, pressing dough into roll at each turn. Press ends to seal and fold under loaf. Place in 2 greased 8x4x2-inch loaf pans or 1 greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pan; brush with oil. Let rise in warm place until double in bulk (30 to 45 minutes). Bake at 400F 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from pans immediately and brush with oil; cool on wire rack. CONVENTIONAL METHOD: Heat milk, sugar, oil, and salt; cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast in warm water (105 to 115F) stir until dissolved. Add lukewarm milk mixture and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Beat in enough additional flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly floured surface; let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Knead until smooth and elastic (8 to 10 minutes). Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch down. Let rest 15 minutes. Follow same shaping and baking instructions as Quick Mix Method.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cold water Mix 1 st 3 ingreds. in 3 qt. glass bowl with wooden spoon until smooth. Cover; let stand in warm, draft-free place for 8 hours. Add 3-3/4 C flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and oil to the mixture in bowl. Stir with wooden spoon until smooth and flour is completely absorbed. (Dough should be just firm enough to gather into a ball. If necessary, add remaining 1/2 C flour gradually, stirring until all flour is absorbed.) Turn dough onto heavily floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1-1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.) Punch dough down; divide into halves. Shape each half into a round, slightly flat loaf. Do not tear dough by pulling. Place loaves in opposite corners of greased cookie sheet. Make three 1/4" deep slashes in each loaf. Let rise until double, about 45 minutes. Heat oven to 375. Brush loaves with cold water. Place cookie sheet in center of oven; it should not touch the sides of the oven. Bake, brushing occasionally with water, until loaves sound hollow when tapped, about 50 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets; cool on wire racks. Be sure to let dough rise completely both times - it might take longer than the estimated times given.

      <li>I must confess I am a Bisquick junkie...and this is my favourite baked meat sandwich. It came from a Bisquick cookbooklet c.1959 (from my dear mother's recipe collection) (Bisquick biscuit recipe: add 2/3 cup milk to 2 cups Bisquick; Stir with fork into a soft dough.) Heat oven to 400 degrees (mod.hot). Cook pork or beef and onion over low heat until no longer pink. (Do not brown. Stir with fork to break up as it cooks.) Cool. Mix in rest of ingredients. Add 1/4 cup mayonnaise to Bisquick dough (see above). Mix well with fork. Spread half of dough in well greased square pan, 8x8x2". Spread meat mixture over dough. Spread rest of dough over mixture. (The top will even out during baking.) Brush with beaten egg yolk to give crusty glaze. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. Cut in slices about 1/2" thick and serve hot or cold. I had to giggle when I typed this recipe up. Numerous times it said to use a fork...and I lost count of the number of times my dad scolded me for using a fork while cooking ....gee, if Betty Crocker used a fork while cooking, it must be alright!!

      <li>1 tablespoon Slivered Garlic</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Minced Fresh Parsley</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Minced Mixed Fresh Herbs</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Red Chile Flakes; crushed</li>
      <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>reheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a baking dish, arrange the olives in a single layer. Add the wine and 2 tablespoons of the oil. Cover tightly with foil. Bake until the olives are fragrant, approximately 45 minutes. Most, but not all, of the liquid should be absorbed; the olives should be tender and somewhat plump. Meanwhile, using a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, parsley, mixed herbs, chile flakes, and the remaining olive oil. Mash to form a paste. (This may also be done in a food processor, although the texture will not be the same.) When the olives are out of the oven and still hot, combine with the garlic paste, tossing thoroughly to mix. Add black pepper to taste. Let the olives marinate for several hours or overnight before serving. The olives may be stored, refrigerated, for several weeks. Bring the olives to room temperature before serving. CRUDITES: 6 cups mixed crisp peeled vegetables, such as carrots, celery, scallions, parsnips, jicama, and red bell pepper, cut into thick strips. WARM GARLIC DIPPING SAUCE: 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 10 garlic cloves, finely slivered 10 anchovy fillets, well rinsed and chopped 1 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the garlic and saute until soft but not brown. Stir in the anchovies, olive oil, vinegar, and parsley and heat through. Keep warm. Serve the olives and crudites arranged on a platter or on individual plates around a ramekin filled with the warm dipping sauce. Serve immediately with lots of crusty French bread.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Sifted all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Persimmon Pulp (instructions follow)</li>
      <li>2 Eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Grated lemon rind</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter or margarine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sift together flour, salt, baking soda, and sugar. Add Persimmon Pulp to the flour mixture along with remaining ingredients. Mix well. Turn batter into a well-greased lightly floured baking dish (8x8x2 inches). Bake in preheated moderate oven (350) for 50 minutes, or until pudding is done. Serve warm with whipped cream, hard sauce, or lemon sauce. Makes 6 servings. Persimmon Pulp: Choose only ripe fruit with a transparent skin. Only ripe fruit is sweet; unripe persimmons have an acid taste and pucker the mouth. Peel and strain pulp. Or mash, removing seeds. If the pulp is not used immediately, stir 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice into each 2 cups pulp, to prevent discoloration.

      <li>2 Stale hamburger buns/rolls; (I used wholewheat)</li>
      <li>2 large Mushrooms; chopped . I used large, brown, flat ones, (I don't know what they are called in America) (up to 3)</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; chopped finely</li>
      <li>3 Or 4 fresh basil leaves; chopped finely OR 2 or 3 sprigs of chopped thyme, (I use a pair of children's paper scissors, with the round blunt ends, roll the leaves into a tight wad, and then chop it up)</li>
      <li>2 Cloves crushed garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Soy milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Mustard; (I used Coleman's Hot English powdered mustard and mixed it with a little water)</li>
      <li>Seasoning to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe was thrown together with odds and bobs in my fridge while my children were visiting their father. I enjoyed it so much I made it again last night for the children. They loved it and so did a meat-eating friend who teases us about our eating habits! It's relatively quick, very easy, and cheap to make. 1. Preheat oven to 180 deg C 2. Slice the top off each roll. 3. Carefully hollow out each roll. Retain bread crumbs 4. Saute mushrooms, onion, garlic, and chopped herbs in the soy milk until onions are soft. 5. Crumble the bread from inside of the rolls into the mushroom mixture. 6. Stir well. You'll find the mixture becomes thick and creamy. 7. Add mustard and seasoning. 8. Spoon the mixture into the rolls, piling it up above the cut surface. 9. Pop the cut top back on the piled mixture. 10. Place the rolls on a baking tray and put them in the oven for about 5 minutes until the rolls are crisp. 11. Serve with a salad or cooked veggies of your choice.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Tofu; firm</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Peanut butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Tamari; or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove (or more); pressed</li>
      <li>1 cup ; water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Arrowroot</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the tofu into small rectangles about 1/4--1/2" thick. In a small bowl, mix together the peanut butter, tamari, and garlic. Slowly stir in the water. Mix well. Place the tofu slices in a shallow dish and pour the liquid over it. Let the tofu marinate for at least 30 minutes. If desired, you may leave it for several hours or overnight. In this case, keep it refrigerated while it is marinating. When you are ready to cook, remove th pieces of tofu from the marinade and place them on a well-oiled cookie sheet. Reserve the liquied to make the sauce. Bake at 375 deg for 30-45 minutes, or until the desired crispness is reached (the longer the tofu bakes, the crisper it becomes). Mix the arrowroot with the remaining marinade. Place the mixture in a saucepan and cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Place the baked tofu on a bed of cooked grains (rice, millet, buckwheat or even pasta). Cover with the sauce. Serve with steamed or stir-fried vegetables and a salad.

      <li>1 ounce Cream -- hot</li>
      <li>2 ounces Butter</li>
      <li>Caramel sauce -- made ahead</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the very top of the pears off and save for garnish. Next, peel the pears, core, and sprinkle with lemon juice. Set aside. Bring the water to a boil and add the sugar, orange juice, and the pears. Make sure the pears are covered to the top with the water. Cover the pan with a lid and simmer until cooked. If ripe, they should cook very fast. Remove the pears when done, stand on a plate, and refrigerate to cool. Fill the pears with vanilla ice cream. Caramel Sauce: Put the sugar and water in a saucepan and cook on med-high until it turns brown, but don't burn. Don't stir the mixture. When the sugar is colored, remove the pan from the heat. Be careful not to burn yourself as the sugar will be very "hot". Carefully, and quickly, stir the "hot" cream and butter into the sugar mixture. Let the caramel sauce cool. ----Note: The water gives the sauce the shine, not the butter. You can thin the sauce with a little cream to use any leftover the next day. --Place caramel sauce on a plate, and place the pear on the sauce. Garnish with the saved pear top.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix together and pour into an ungreased 9 x 13 baking pan. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until golden brown. This re-heats well. You can assemble ahead (even overnight) and bake later. ENJOY!!! NOTES : ***** I use Rice Dream, or Vitasoy milk instead of dairy. ***** I sometimes substitute flax seed mixture for one or more of the eggs. The result is the same taste but a slightly softer texture. Flax seed mixture: Place in blender: 1/2 cup whole organic flax seeds. Blend until a fine meal. Add 1 1/2 cup cold water and blend 2-3 minutes until thickened and has consistency of eggs. Use 1/4 cup flax seed mixture to replace one egg in baking. To make it a little extra special, try pouring half of the batter in the pan, then placing fresh, sliced fruit over top. We use bananas, kiwi, apples and others. Now, pour the remaining batter over the fruit and spread evenly to cover.

      <li>4 ounces Lump crabmeat</li>
      <li>8 Fresh oysters on the half shell</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Grated parm cheese</li>

      <li>Instructions: Prepare seafood sauce. Preheat oven to 325 deg. f . Carefully pick the crabmeat to remove any shells or cartilage. Put it into a small bowl and using a rubber spatula, gently fold in 1/4 cup of the seafood sauce. Being careful not to break up the lumps. Spread 1 tbsp of this mixture over each oyster on the half shell and top them off with 1/2 tsp of the seafood sauce. Grate the parmasan on the fine side of the box grater and sprinkle it over each oyster. Spread a layer of rock salt in the bottom of the baking dish to stabilizer the oysters during baking. Nestle the oysters into the salt, bake for 6 minutes then turn on the broiler just long enough to get a golden brown glaze. Serve at once while the oysters are piping hot.

While the pasta is cooking, trim the zucchini but do not peel. Slice the zucchini thinly, place in a colander, and sprinkle with salt. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to drain off excess moisture. Put the zucchini between 2 layers of paper towels and squeeze dry with your hands. Place the zucchini in a well-greased 9 x 13-inch clear baking dish. Top with the onion slices, then with the potatoes. Dot with 2 tablespoons of the butter and sprinkle the prosciutto on top. Dot with 2 more tablespoons of butter. Sprinkle 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese on top. In a separate bowl, mix the pasta, parsley, and basil with the salt and pepper to taste. Distribute the pasta over the vegetables in the baking dish. Dot with 2 more tablespoons of butter. Top the pasta with the tomatoes, dot with the remaining butter, and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on top. The casserole can be refrigerated for 4 hours at this point. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake 45 minutes to 1 hour. Turn off the oven, open the oven door, and let the dish stand for about 10 minutes before serving.

    <title>Baked or Grilled Fish with Dijon Glaze</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Fish fillets or steaks; 7 ounce</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lemon Herb Dijon Glaze</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry white wine</li>
      <li>Fresh herb; for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven or grill to 500 degrees (or 450 degrees if that temperature is just too scary at first). Heat the pan on high heat, until it is very hot. While it is heating, brush glaze over all surfaces of the fish, particularly all flesh. To Bake: When the pan is hot (using potholders) put the fish in and brown on one side. Turn the fish after 2 minutes and put the pan into the oven. Bake for another few minutes. Remember: 5 minutes to the inch of thickness. To Grill: Put fish on grill and cook, turning only once (for 5 minutes per inch). Take the fish out of the oven or off the grill, and immediately transfer it to a warmed serving dish or warmed individual plates.Add wine to the pan and cook at medium high, whisking constantly until the sauce is reduced by half. For grilling, cook wine and 1 tbsp. Dijon glaze in a small pan. Pour over the fish, garnish with fresh herb, and serve immediately. NOTES : You will need a heavy, oven-proof pan, preferably non-stick coated or seasoned cast iron. A pan is not necessary for grilling. Before you make the sauce or Demi-Glace make a slight separation in the flesh to stop the cooking. Most fish is overcooked; its natural moisture is leached out by prolonged heat, so its delicate texture becomes stringy or a little tough. The less time fish is exposed to moisture-sapping heat, in the oven or on a grill, the moister it will be. The hotter the heat, the less time it is exposed. Dijon Glaze seals the pores of the flesh so fish can withstand 500 heat.

Butterscotch Dessert Sauce: Heat all ingredients except vanilla to boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil, stirring frequently, 5 minutes; remove from heat. Stir in vanilla; cool completely. Source: Betty Crocker Cookbook Notes (plm): The original recipe from Susan Gruenwald called for 3 cups of fresh peaches, thinly sliced, 1 cup of DARK brown sugar and did not call for the seasonings, other than cinnamon. In addition, the Butterscotch Sauce originally called for 1 tablespoon rum or 1 teaspoon of rum flavoring - as we had neither, I substituted the vanilla.

Unfold the pie crusts, one at a time, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each into a 10inch square. Cut each square into 1inch strips. Starting at the bottom of the pear, begin wrapping the pastry strips carefully around the pear. Overlap the strips by about 1/4 of an inch as you cover the pear. Continue wrapping by moistening ends of the strips until the pear is completely covered. Repeat with each of the pears. Place pears on a baking sheet. Combine eggyolk and water; brush evenly on pastry. Bake at 350 for 1 hour or until tender. Spoon 3-4 TBS of Caramel Sauce onto each dessert plate; top with a pear. Serves 5-6. Caramel Sauce: Combine caramel and condensed milk in a double boiler, bring water to boil reduce heat to low and cook until smooth, Stirring consistantly. Stir in lemon juice and Cointreau.

    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Sleeves Saltine Crackers; crushed</li>
      <li>3 cans Whole Oysters; Drained, reserve liquid</li>
      <li>1 Stick Butter Or Margarine; melted</li>
      <li>Evaporated Milk; Approx 1/2 To 2/3 Cup</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Black Pepper; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Into large bowl, combine crackers, drained oysters, melted butter and black pepper to taste. Stir gently till well mixed. Add evaporated milk to reserved oyster liquid to make 2 cups. Pour into cracker-oyster mixture, stir gently to mix well. Spoon mixture into greased casserole dish ( I use my deep "French White" Pyrex casserole dish). Pour enough milk over mixture to make it "soupy". Milk should be to top of mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes until "puffed" and lightly browned. (This dish is better too moist than it is too dry. It has taken me several attempts to get this right because I thought I was adding too much milk to it. It was always turning out too dry until I let go of my fear of making it too "soupy". I hardly ever get it to turn out exactly the same every time, but at least it's not too dry anymore!!!) Notes: It just isn't Thanksgiving or Christmas w/o Mom's Baked Oysters!! This is my absolute favorite holiday dish. I AM thinking of modifying it the next time by adding about 1/2 cup of thinly sliced, celery.

      <li>4 Bermuda or Vidalia onions, 3" dia</li>
      <li>1/4 cups (1/2 stick) butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sour cream, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Brown sugar</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees (F). Place the unpeeled onions in a foil-lined shallow pan. Bake, uncovered, for 1-1/2 hours. Warm a heatproof shallow serving dish. When onions are tender, remove from oven. Spear each with a fork, snip or cut off both ends, and remove skin. Place the peeled onions in the warmed dish. Immediately add the butter and sour cream so they will melt from the heat of the onions. Then add the rest of the ingredients and toss lightly to mix. [Note: these will hold nicely in a warm oven for 1/2 - 1 hour.] If you can't make this with real butter and sour cream, it really isn't worth making.

    <quantity>48</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup Packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 Egg white, beaten</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: STREUSEL</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Butter, cold</li>
      <li>3/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>Colored sugar for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 15 minutes Baking time: 20 to 25 minutes 1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 15- by 10-inch jelly-roll pan. Cream butter, sugar, egg and vanilla in mixing bowl. Stir in cinnamon and salt. Add flour, a little at a time. Blend well. Press into pan to 1/4 -inch thickness with wax paper. 2. Brush beaten egg white over dough. Combine streusel ingredients in food processor. Process until butter is evenly blended. Sprinkle streusel over dough. Bake 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack 15 minutes. Cut into 2- by 1 1/2 ~inch bars while still warm. Note: The test kitchen found that a mixture of ground spices such as cinnamon, allspice, ginger, cardamom and cloves also works nicely in place of the cinnamon, and for the holiday season, a sprinkling of colored sugar before baking brightens up these cookies. This recipe from Mary Pat Knopp of Chicago placed third in the 1989 cookie contest. from the Chicago Tribune second annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 14, 1989 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 01:07:01 +0000</li>

Add the rice and continue browning until the rice starts to lose it's translucent quality. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook about 40 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed. This is one of my most requested family favorites, it freezes well, and holds well for buffets and pot lucks.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Whipping cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>3 cups Sifted all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Decorations: colored sugar,</li>
      <li>Raisins, chocolate</li>
      <li>Sprinkles, chocolate chips</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 45 minutes Chilling time: Several hours Baking time: 7 minutes 1. Cream butter. Gradually add sugar and cream well. Blend in the egg, cream, baking powder, baking soda, salt and vanilla. Gradually add flour and mix well. Chill dough until firm, several hours (it is hard to roll out otherwise). 2. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Roll out dough on a floured board to about 1/8- inch thick. Cut into desired shapes with a flour-dipped cookie cutter. Place on ungreased or lightly greased cookie sheet. 3. Decorate with colored sugar and chocolate sprinkles and use raisins or chocolate chips for the eyes of the animals. Bake for 5-7 minutes or until a little brown. Cool on racks. Don't forget to cut the little holes if you wish to hang on the tree. Note: Dough will keep several days or a week in the refrigerator if you don't get around to cutting right away. I store the cookies in tightly covered tins and they are very good keepers if the children don't find them. Winner Beverly Bergstrom of Hinsdale recounts making rolled animal cookies: "We called them animal cookies although there were many cutters that were not animals. We would cut small pieces of paper drinking straws and insert them in the top of each cookie and then bake them. The little piece of straw was removed just as the cookies came from the oven, leaving a perfect little hole to put a colored string through so the cookie could be hung on our huge Christmas tree. "My sister and I would always make sure lots of the cookies were hung around the back of the tree. The tree was in the corner of the living room leaving a space behind, where we could crawl in. A favorite pastime during the holiday season was to lie on the floor behind the tree and using no hands, take tasty bites of the cookies, leaving behind the empty strings decorating the tree. Grandma would always pretend anger when she 'discovered' the empty strings and no cookie. It was a good game." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 4, 1986 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dark corn syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted butter or margarine</li>
      <li>4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>Liquid food coloring,</li>
      <li>If desired</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 1 1/2 hours Chilling time: 12 hours or more Cooking time: 7 minutes 1. Put sugar, syrup, water, ginger, cinnamon and cloves into a large saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture boils and sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Add butter. Stir until butter is melted and mixture is no longer very hot. 2. Mix flour and baking soda. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir to blend thoroughly. Dough will have a soft texture. Place dough in an airtight container and refrigerate overnight or at least 12 hours or as long as 1 week. 3. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove about one-sixth of the dough and knead it until it is slightly softened. Roll dough directly onto ungreased cookie sheets until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to stamp shapes in dough, allowing a 1-inch margin between each cookie. Remove excess dough by lifting it and peeling it away. Scraps of dough can be kneaded together and re-rolled. 4. Bake until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool slightly and become crisp before removing them from the cookie sheet. Cool thoroughly on wire racks. If desired, you may "paint" the cooled cookies using a clean, small paintbrush and food coloring that has been watered down slightly. Store cookies in airtight containers. Note: After the 12-hour resting period, this cookie dough can be hand-molded like clay--rolled, pinched, poked and pressed--and it will keep its shape, expanding slightly while baking. Thin cookies will become brown and bake quickly, large and thick shapes will require longer baking. Can be cut into any shape desired but make the cookies uniformly thick. The microwave oven can be used to cook the sugar mixture in step 1.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baker's ammonia</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Milk</li>
      <li>6 Eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>(about 6 cups)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Anise oil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 pounds Cake flour, sifted</li>
      <li>(about 8 cups)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 40 minutes Standing time: 1 hour plus overnight Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes Aging time: 1 week or more 1. Mash baker's ammonia with a rolling pin if it is not powdered. Dissolve it in the milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 hour before using. 2. Beat eggs in large bowl of electric mixer until thick and lemon-colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until creamy and smooth. Add butter and beat again until creamy. Add anise oil, dissolved baker's ammonia and salt; beat to mix. Gradually beat in enough flour to make a stiff dough. 3. Cut off pieces of dough and work in more flour on a floured work surface until dough is stiff enough to roll out and hold the design of the springerle rolling pin or mold. Roll out on a lightly floured board with a floured rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Press design on dough with a floured springerle rolling pin or mold. Cut cookies apart using a floured knife. Leave on work surface covered with a clean kitchen towel overnight. 4. The next day, heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake cookies on greased baking sheets, until barely golden on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Store in tightly covered tins and allow to mellow at least 1 week before serving. Note: This recipe also can be made using 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in place of the milk and the baker's ammonia) and anise extract instead of anise oil. However, the cookies will not be as delicately textured and the anise flavor not quite as rich. If using baking powder, add it with the salt to the batter. Connie Meisinger of Buffalo Grove tied for third place with this recipe. from the Chicago Tribune sixth annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 2, 1993 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 04:11:40 +0000</li>

      <li>1. Beat butter and granulated sugar in large bowl of electric mixer until light and fluffy. Slowly add flour and blend well. Remove from bowl and knead until shiny. Divide dough in half; wrap in wax paper. Refrigerate dough until it is firm enough to roll, several hours or longer. Let dough soften slightly on counter if too firm to roll. 2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Roll dough between two sheets of floured wax paper or flatten dough with floured hands to 1/4-inch thickness on a floured surface. Use cookie cutters to make shapes. Transfer to ungreased baking sheets. Bake only until slightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool on cookie sheets just long enough to firm cookies and then remove to wire racks to cool completely. 3. To assemble, spread half of the cookies with a small amount of jam and sandwich with another cookie. Put confectioners' sugar into a small bowl and drizzle in just enough milk to make a thin glaze. Frost cookies lightly with the glaze and sprinkle with colored sugar. Let stand until glaze hardens.

      <li>For decoration</li>
      <li>1 Egg yolk mixed w/1 ts water</li>
      <li>Icing for decorating</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 25 minutes Chilling time: 8 hours or overnight Baking time: 7 to 10 minutes 1. Beat margarine, sugar and molasses in a large mixing bowl. Add egg and mix well. 2. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg. Add to butter mixture; mix well. 3. Divide dough into 4 equal portions on a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap and shape into a flat disk about 1 inch thick. Refrigerate until firm, about 8 hours, or freeze for 2 hours. (Dough can be refrigerated up to 3 days.) 4. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Working with 1 disk of the dough at a time, roll out on a well-floured board, dusting the rolling pin as you work. Dough will be very soft and can be difficult to work with so work quickly and use plenty of flour. Using cookie cutters dipped in flour, cut into desired shapes. Put cookies 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Use currants or candy for eyes or buttons, if desired. 5. Bake until lightly puffed, 7 to 10 minutes. First batch may be puffier because they will have less flour rolled in them. While still warm, paint with egg yolk wash if desired. Cool on wire racks. Cool completely, then decorate as desired with icing. Icing: Mix confectioners' sugar with a small amount of water until thick and spreading consistency. Add food coloring if desired and put in a small plastic bag. Cut a small hole in one corner and drizzle icing out onto the cooled cookies. Note: A 4-inch gingerbread cookie cutter was used in testing. Oak Brook's Gloria Heeter is a newcomer to the Chicago area and brings her favorite gingerbread cookie with her from Kansas City, Kan. "About nine years ago, my neighbor, Diane Collins, brought them over for Halloween in Halloween shapes," she says. "I took out some of the egg yolks and substituted corn oil margarine rather than shortening, which sometimes can have palm oil in it." Calling them "truly a cookie for all seasons," Heeter once even made them for her golden retriever's first birthday party. "We invited the neighborhood kids in for punch and cookies-cookies shaped like dogbones." At Christmas, though, "I typically print the names of each person on the cookies, place them in a plastic bag and decorate them with a red and green ribbon," writes Heeter of her personalized gingerbread people. "A handmade gift is always filled with love." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 8, 1988 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:51 +0000</li>

      <li>Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: Overnight Baking time: 10 minutes 1. Cream shortening and sugar in mixing bowl, beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix water and baking soda in small bowl until dissolved. Add baking soda mixture and sorghum to butter mixture. Sift 5 1/2 cups of the flour, the spices and salt together. Blend into dough. Divide dough into 4 balls. Wrap in plastic wrap. Flatten and refrigerate overnight. 2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Roll 1 portion of dough out at a time on lightly floured surface. Cut into desired shapes. Bake on a greased cookie sheet until puffed, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake. 3. When cool, decorate with buttercream frosting and/or candies as desired. Sorghum gives these cookies a special flavor, but molasses can be used as a substitute. Ann Smith of Plainfield won second place, and described how her gingerbread men left Bohemia in 1872 and immigrated to the United States. Smith's great-grandmother, "Babicka" Novak, lived in a small Czech-American town in South Dakota where Smith's mother grew up in the 1920s. At Christmas time, her great-grandma would give her neighbors Old World gingerbread men, reindeer and rocking horses. "One year when Great-grandma delivered the cookies, she brought along her teenaged grandson, who was visiting from a small ethnic Czech community in Nebraska," Smith wrote. "Introductions made that day over the watchful eyes of the gingerbread men eventually lead to wedding bells for my parents a decade later. Great-grandma Novak probably had planned this all along!" from the Chicago Tribune second annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 14, 1989 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 01:07:01 +0000</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes 1. Cream butter and confectioners' sugar in large mixer bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks. Beat in flour and 1 c ground nuts until mixed. (Dough can be refrigerated up to several days; soften slightly before shaping cookies.) 2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready. 3. For topping, beat egg whites lightly with fork in shallow dish until frothy. Mix 1 cup nuts and granulated sugar in separate shallow dish. 4. Roll a generous teaspoon of the dough in the palm of your hands into a crescent shape. Dip top of crescent in egg white and then into nut-sugar mixture. Place crescents on baking sheets about 1 inch apart. Bake until bottoms are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on pan a few minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Sprinkle lightly with confectioners' sugar before serving. This winning recipe is from Mila Tomisek of Chicago. She prefers to use unsalted butter, but says margarine can be substituted. The cookies are very fragile. Mila first began baking these small, buttery, crescent-shaped cookies with her grandmother during World War I; today, at 82, she still bakes them for her children and grandchildren. from the Chicago Tribune third annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 13, 1990 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 01:06:56 +0000</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 2 1/2 hours Chilling time: Overnight Cooking time: 12 to 15 minutes 1. Beat butter and cream cheese in large bowl of electric mixer until light. Beat in flour and cream until well mixed. Divide dough into 4 portions. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready. 3. Sprinkle the work surface and the rolling pin generously with confectioners' sugar. Roll out 1 dough portion at a time to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use a small (2-inch diameter) round cutter or glass to cut out cookies. Transfer to ungreased baking sheets, leaving 1 or 2 inches between each cookie. Make a small depression in the center of the cookies with your fingertip. Fill scantily with jam, jelly, preserves, cheese or nut filling. (If you use too much filling it will run out onto the baking sheet.) 4. Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Sprinkle generously with confectioners' sugar while still warm. Cream cheese filling: Beat together 1 package (8 ounces) softened cream cheese, 1 egg yolk, 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract until well mixed. Nut filling: Cook 1 cup coarsely ground walnuts in 2 tablespoons butter with 1/3 cup granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract until nuts turn golden. Cool. Third-place winner Shere Case of Hickory Hills, Illinois fills her cookies with a variety of jams, a cheese filling and a nut filling for an attractive assortment.

      <li>SERVES 18 NORMAL PERSONS OR 4 CHICAGO FIREFIGHTERS Everybody knows that there is no such thing as a 19-alarm fire. Why, that would mean that babies, lifeguards, bartenders, everyone, would have to show up to fight it! However, Frank Jacobson of the Chicago Fire Department thinks his chili requires 19 alarms. I am ready! Please note that he makes this in small batches. If you do not know what a #10 can is, figure on just under a gallon. In a large pot bring the tomato purâe and whole tomatoes to a slow boil. While this is heating, brown the ground beef with chopped onion. Add this to the tomato mixture. Add chili powder and simmer for 1 hour. Add oregano, salt, and pepper to taste and simmer 15 minutes. Add kidney beans and simmer 30 minutes. Serve in a bowl with Cheddar cheese on top and a dollop of sour cream placed in the center. Diced yellow onions complete the garnish. "Following the meal have Rolaids available."

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes 1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in flour and salt. Knead the dough briefly until smooth. If dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour. (Dough can be refrigerated up to several days; soften slightly before shaping cookies.) 2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready. 3. Pat half of the dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/2 -inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Place cookies 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake until light brown on edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Note: The sheep cookie cutter used by Koenig is a Hallmark cutter that is no longer available. A sheep pattern can be made out of cardboard and placed over dough; cut out the shape with a small knife. Third prize went to Betty J. Koenig, of Hammond, Ind., for her recipe for shortbread cookies in the shape of sheep. Betty uses a sheep cookie cutter to make these cookies. She suggests using your fingertips to dimple the dough to resemble their wooly coats. If desired, a small piece of chocolate can be used for eyes after baking.

Beat butter in large bowl of electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in half of the flour, the sugar, vanilla and water until thoroughly combined. Beat in the remaining flour. 3. Use a scant 1 tablespoon of dough and press it flat and thin with your hands. Put a chocolate mint wafer in the center and fold the dough over to completely cover each chocolate and to form a neat, rectangular package. Pinch the edges to seal. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. 4. Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool a few minutes on the baking sheets and then cool completely on wire racks. 5. For icing, mix confectioners' sugar and milk to make a thin icing; color icing as desired. Use a small spatula to ice cookies. Decorate as desired so cookies resemble Christmas packages. For variety, second-place winner Carol Feezell of Skokie, Illinois uses several kinds of miniature candies in her pretty cookies.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 Egg, separated</li>
      <li>1 cup Flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Finely chopped nuts</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Raspberry jam</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 20 minutes Chilling time: 1 hour Baking time: 15 to 18 minutes 1. Beat together butter and sugar in a mixer bowl. Add vanilla and egg yolk. Mix well. 2. Mix flour and salt, add to butter mixture and mix well. Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour. 3. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Beat egg white lightly in a small bowl. Put nuts in another small bowl. Dip each ball into egg white, then roll in nuts. Put balls 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Press thumb in the center of each to make an indentation. 4. Bake until light golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool on wire racks. Fill indentation with a small amount of raspberry jam. Faye Kuhn, of Earlville, Illinois, recalled growing up in the tough times of the '40s: "Despite the lack of finances, no holiday was ever ignored in our household. Christmas, however, held the highest of honors. . . We all boarded the train and off to the city we would go. We would arrive home loaded with 'Evening in Paris' cologne, mittens, socks, handkerchiefs and coloring books bought at Kresge's and Woolworth's. Mom would then visit the local A &amp; P for turkey, cranberries, sweet potatoes, fresh ground coffee, nuts, apples, oranges and one pound of butter to baste ol' Tom with. However, there was one thing my mother didn't do in those days and that was to bake Christmas cookies, for neither time nor money allowed such a luxury." But when her mother retired, she started baking Christmas cookies, Kuhn recalls. The family wanted her to make the thumbprints, yet no one knew the name or the recipe. "Mother put on her coat, crossed our back yard and knocked on our neighbor's door. She returned somewhat later, victorious, with recipe card in hand." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 8, 1988 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:51 +0000</li>

Winner Jeanette McCarthy, Downers Grove, Illinois, describes her impatient person's "I'm hungry" cookies: "When I was a child, part of our Christmas celebration involved visits to my father's relatives during the time between Christmas and Epiphany. Great-Aunt Elizabeth came from a family whose women had been cooks for a wealthy family in Hungary. As a result, her cooking was usually slightly different and somewhat elegant. "A treasured memory of Christmas at Great-Aunt Elizabeth's house was a cookie that I never learned to eat in moderation. Although my mother warned me not to say anything, one of the first things I would say upon arrival was, 'I'm hungry,' hoping that these cookies would appear. Much to my delight they usually did, and in fact, began also to appear at Easter, the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and any other time we got together to celebrate." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 4, 1986 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000</li>

      <li>Finely chopped pecans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 50 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes 1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready. 2. Cream butter, sugar and vanilla in large mixer bowl until well-mixed. Stir in flour and baking powder. (If kitchen is warm, refrigerate dough for a few minutes; dough should be firm enough to roll easily.) Shape scant teaspoonsful of dough into balls about the size of a marble. Place on baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between cookies. Flatten slightly. 3. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool. 4. Melt chocolate chips with shortening in top of double boiler set over simmering water. Remove from heat. 5. Flatten caramel halves so they are the same diameter as the cookie. Put one caramel half on top of each cookie. (If necessary, use a dab of chocolate as "glue" to help caramel adhere to cookie.) Using a small metal spatula, spread melted chocolate thinly over top and sides of caramel and cookie to cover. Press chopped pecans onto tops of cookies. Let stand on a wire rack until chocolate firms (refrigerate if desired), about 20 minutes. Put into individual paper wrappers. Store in a cookie tin with a piece of wax paper between each layer. The first-place winner of the Tribune's 1991 Holiday Cookie Contest is Elaine Rysner. She prefers to make the cookies small - about the diameter of a quarter. Use high-quality caramels and chocolate for the best cookies. from the Chicago Tribune fourth annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 5, 1991 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 11:24:32 +0000</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>3 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 Egg yolks, beaten</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Grated rind of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>12 ounces Apricot preserves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Rum</li>
      <li>Confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 1 1/4 hours Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes 1. Sift flour into a large mixing bowl and make an indentation or well in the center of the flour. Add the sugar, egg yolks, vanilla, salt and lemon rind to the well. Mix the ingredients in the well together with the flour. Then cut in the butter using a pastry cutter or two sharp knives. At this point the dough will resemble coarse crumbs. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead it with your hands until smooth and firm. Divide dough in half and shape into two balls. 2. Wrap tightly in plastic. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll out, about 1 hour. 3. Meanwhile, heat the apricot preserves over low heat, stirring constantly. Stir in lemon juice and rum. Let cool. 4. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface or between two sheets of floured wax paper. Roll out with a floured rolling pin to about 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out circles of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Place half of the circles onto greased or non-stick cookie sheets. Cut the other half of the circles again with a small shot glass or cookie cutter to form a ring shape. (Make an equal amount of rings to circles.) Place the rings onto buttered baking sheets. Bake until light gold, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool a little on the cookie sheets. 5. To assemble, brush the still-warm circles with the cooled apricot mixture. Place one ring on top of each circle and press gently (they break easily) to secure. Spoon a small dollop of the apricot mixture into the center of the cookies. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Cool. Store in a tightly closed tin. Infused with bits of lemon and pure vanilla and filled with apricot preserves and rum, the buttery rounds brought second-place honors to their baker, German-born Anne Kroemer of Chicago. Anne uses a wine glass and a smaller schnapps glass to cut out these cookies. We've made them slightly smaller by using round cookie cutters; biscuit cutters work as well. from the Chicago Tribune sixth annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 2, 1993 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 04:11:40 +0000</li>

      <li>UTENSILS: 2 qt. sauce pan Colander or large strainer measuring cups and spoons food processor, mixer or blender (use your hands only if slightly Masochistic) Pate molds or buttered 9" cake pan with release or a bowl PREPARATION: In sauce pan, combine livers, stock, spices, garlic, celery, onion, pepper &amp; salt. Add enough wine to just cover ingredients and bring to boiling point. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 1/2 hour. When done, place contents in the colander. Reserve the wine broth and allow it to stand and cool. Discard the bayleaf from the contents in the colander and allow remainder to cool for 1/2 hour. Gently ladel off the wine broth until the liquid containing the sediment equals 2/3 cup. Save the clear broth in case you need more. Be sure to catch all the sediment because it is an important part of the recipe. In your food processor; combine the contents of the colander, sediment broth, butter, mustard and 1/2 of the crumbled bacon. Process until the mixture is a smooth, soupy puree. Fold in remaining bacon and pour into final mold. If it is too thick to pour, you need to add more broth. Allow pate to set in refrigerator for at least 24 hours. Unmold, lightly sprinkle with cracked peppercorns and garnish with sliced olives and parsley. This recipe is an antique French farm recipe reported to be over 100 years old. It is a classic recipe with wonderful spices and subtle flavors. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #159 by jarin@odyssee.net (Jacques Lorrain) on Jun 8, 1997</li>

      <li>Preparation time: 45 minutes Baking time: 16 minutes 1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. For cookies, sift flour, sugar and salt into bowl. Cut in 1 cup butter with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Blend in almonds and vanilla. Work mixture with fingers until a ball of dough is formed. Then shape into 1-inch balls. 2. Place balls on greased cookie sheets; make a depression in center of each cookie. Bake about 8 minutes; remove from oven. Dent again and bake about 8 minutes longer; cool. 3. For frosting, blend 6 tablespoons butter, half-and-half and brown sugar in saucepan. Boil 2 minutes, stirring constantly; remove from heat. Cool about 15 minutes, then stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth and thick. 4. Fill depressions in cookies with butterscotch frosting and sprinkle frosting with nuts. Winner Penney L. Haney of Kenosha described these cookies: "Oh, the aroma! Dad knew his 'girls' had been baking as soon as he stepped in the back door, brushing snowflakes from his coat. He warmed his hands over the hot oven, slowly recovering feeling in his fingertips, numb from stringing red, yellow, blue, green and white lights in the pines in the yard. His chore and our special treat combined each year to mark the beginning of our holiday preparations. "While chatting to Mom about trying to locate the single, burned-out bulb that had kept an entire strand out, he watched me, his tiny daughter, with not so dexterous fingers, shaping dough into big marbles. I had to kneel on a wooden chair to reach the table, with Mom's brightly-colored apron wrapped around me nearly twice, held together in back by a giant safety pin." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 4, 1986 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000</li>

      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped pecans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 25 minutes Baking time: 10 to 12 minutes 1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cream butter, sugar and egg. Stir in flour, vanilla and pecans. Mix well by hand. Shape into balls about the size of walnuts, place on cookie sheets and flatten to about 1/8 inch. 2. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely and harden. Winner Jean McGree of Flossmoor "bores everyone," she says, with this family tale of Christmas praline cookies: "Since the time Mom had been a little girl, each November Grandma would surround her back yard pecan tree with sheets to catch the falling nuts. But most of the nuts had to be knocked from the branches with her long-handled broom. Then she would spend hours stooped over those sheets, picking up the pecans and sorting the good ones from the black and hollow shells. "When her daughter married and moved away, the nuts were carefully picked over, packaged and shipped 'up North.' Free time in the first week of December was always marked for shelling the pecans. Sore hands and stiff backs were repaid with secret nibbling and promises of praline cookies for Christmas. "Soon, I'll start looking for a package from Great-Grandma in South Carolina. Then, as we crack the pecans, I can retell the 'pecan story' to Michael and Ann, who know that Santa always looks for pralines on Christmas Eve." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 4, 1986 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000</li>

      <li>Milk or whipping cream, if necessary</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. To brown the butter, melt butter in a small, heavy saucepan over low heat. When fully melted, increase heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, until the butter turns a medium brown and smells nutty. Measure out 1 cup to use for cookies and reserve the rest for the filling. Refrigerate until firm but not solid, about 30 minutes. 2. For cookies, heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ready a cookie press and ungreased baking sheet(s). 3. Beat the 1 cup brown butter, 1/2 cup of the confectioners' sugar, vanilla and salt in large bowl of electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and egg yolks and mix to combine. Stop mixer and add flour; mix on low speed just until flour disappears. 4. Transfer dough to a cookie press and press onto baking sheet in desired shapes, spacing them 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake until set, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. 5. For filling, cook maple syrup in a heavy 2-quart saucepan over high heat for 5 minutes. Cool to lukewarm then stir in remaining 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar. Beat the reserved brown butter in a food processor or a small bowl of electric mixer until light. Add the syrup mixture and beat until smooth. If mixture is too thick, add a small amount of milk or cream until it is spreadable. 6. Assemble cookies by spreading about 1/2 teaspoon filling on the flat side of half the cookies. Sandwich with another cookie.

Add egg and vanilla to butter-sugar mixture and beat well. Gradually add dry ingredients to butter-sugar mixture and beat until well blended. 2. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheet and push down center of each ball with thumb. Drain cherries and reserve juice. Place 1 cherry in center of each indentation. Heat oven to 350 degrees. 3. For frosting, put chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk in small saucepan. Heat until chocolate melts. Stir in 4 teaspoons cherry juice. If too thick, add more juice. 4. Spoon 1 teaspoon frosting over each cherry. Spread to cover cherry. Bake 10 minutes or until done. Do not overcook. Remove to wire rack and cool. The cookies freeze nicely. Winner Donna M. Farrell of Naperville entered her chocolate covered cherry cookie recipe: "Christmas and chocolate-covered cherries are forever entwined in my mind and memories. Not the expensive department store kind, mind you, with their dark bitter chocolate and runny syrup, but your basic Brach's. Each Christmas found the coveted white box stretching my stocking, two layers of cream-filled heaven with a cherry floating therein--and no requirement to share them with anyone. "Taste and calories have kept me away from the box of delights for many years, even after the incredible discovery that Brach's actually sold these morsels all year long. (How my parents managed to deceive me on this, I'll never know.) That is, until my mother-in-law came to Chicago one autumn with the ultimate cookie. A Christmas tradition in one bite. Nostalgia from the oven. Capable of reducing this 36-year-old woman's taste buds and mentality to that of my 9-year-old daughter.

      <li>The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a lighter loaf. When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset the machine and start again. Some manufacturers produce home bakeries with a whole wheat cycle; if your machine doesn't have one, this start- again method works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS: The gluten gives the whole wheat flour the structure necessary for a good loaf. If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food store. Remember the extra knead. It's especially important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, us this recipe only on the regular bake cycle.

      <li>2 cups Warm water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dry active yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups White flour</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Rye flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Corn flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vegetable oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Stir the sugar into the water. Sprinkle in the yeast. Let the mixture stand until the yeast bubbles to the surface. Stir in the white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Mix well. Cover the batter with waxed paper and a towel. Let it sit until it is bubbly, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Stir down the batter, and add the salt, the rye flour and the corn flour. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour over a work surface, and turn the dough onto it. Knead the wheat flour into the dough, sprinkling with more white flour if the dough is still too sticky. Knead until the dough is firm but springy. Grease a clean bowl with the vegetable oil. Set the dough in the bowl, and turn the dough over to coat it completely with the oil. Cover the dough with waxed paper and a towel, and set it to rise until it is double in bulk, about 1 hour, or overnight in the refridgerator. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Punch down the dough, and divide in two. Knead it into two round loaves. With a sharp knife, cut a slash around the circumference of each loaf and prick the top. Set the loaves on a lightly floured cookie sheet. The dough need not rise again for baking. Bake the bread for 45 minutes, or until a tap on the bottom of the loaf produces a hollow sound. Set the loaves on racks to cool. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 8 hours or overnight Cooking time: 10 minutes 1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl of electric mixer. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in lemon rind and juice. Mix flour, baking powder and salt. Stir flour mixture and ground almonds into butter mixture to make a soft dough. Divide dough into quarters. Refrigerate dough, wrapped in wax paper, until firm, at least 8 hours or overnight. 2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready. 3. Roll out one dough portion on lightly floured pastry cloth with a rolling pin covered with stocking or roll between sheets of lightly floured wax paper to 1/8 -inch thickness. Cut out with cookie cutters. Return dough to refrigerator if it gets too soft. Transfer to baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired. 4. Bake until very light brown at edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool. Store in a covered tin. This second-place winner, from Judy M. Drux of Dyer, Indiana, makes very thin, crisp, delicate cookies. The dough keeps well in the refrigerator if well-wrapped. This cookie was a tribute to her husband's grandmother, Antonia Drux, who emigrated to this country from Germany in 1923. (Oma means "grandma" in German.) The recipe has been passed down as just a list of ingredients. Drux added a few hints to help make baking them easier for future cooks. from the Chicago Tribune fourth annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 5, 1991 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 11:24:32 +0000</li>

Stir in corn syrup, orange rind and water. Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt. Stir into butter mixture to form a dough. Divide dough in half. Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate overnight. 2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have lightly greased baking sheets ready. 3. Roll out one piece of dough at a time on a lightly floured surface or between sheets of floured wax paper to 1/8 -inch thickness. Cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Place on baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Bake until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool. 4. For icing, mix egg white and almond extract in small bowl until frothy. Stir in confectioners' sugar until mixture is a drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cookies. Let stand until icing sets. Store covered. Note: This recipe uses raw egg white. Cases of salmonella poisoning have been traced to raw eggs, although this is rare and usually associated with the yolks. These orange-flavored ginger cookies captured third place for Janis C. Peterson of Geneva, Illinois. The rolled, cutout cookies are easy to bake, have a delicious combination of fresh tastes and are sure to bring pleasure to the recipients. from the Chicago Tribune fourth annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 5, 1991 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339 From: Linda Place &lt;placel@worldnet.att.net&gt; Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 11:24:32 +0000</li>

      <li>Preparation time: 20 minutes Chilling time: 4 hours Baking time: 10 minutes 1. Put flour, sugar, butter, baking powder, salt, almond extract and egg into large bowl of an electric mixer. Mix together, using low speed. Dough will be crumbly. Then knead dough with hands until mixture holds together. 2. Remove 1/3 cup of the dough; wrap and refrigerate. Divide remaining dough in thirds. Using hands, roll each into a 6-inch log. 3. Put sugar crystals on a sheet of wax paper. Roll each log in the sugar crystals to coat well; use the wax paper as a guide to press in crystals. Shape each log into a triangle, pressing gently on wax paper to give three sharp corners. Make sure to make 2 sides longer than the third side. Wrap each log well and refrigerate at least 4 hours or until dough is firm enough to slice. To this point, cookies can be made up to a week in advance. 4. Heat oven to 350 degrees. To bake, slice logs crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Put slices about 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. For each cookie, shape about 1/2 teaspoon of the reserved 1/3 cup dough into a tree trunk. Attach to bottom underside of each tree. Sprinkle each cookie lightly with candy decorations, if desired. Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove to wire racks. Cool completely. Note: The logs can be divided and shaped into 3 sizes and sliced to form a 3-tiered tree. These second-place winning cookies are easily shaped into trees that are edged with glittery green sugar.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>cut into 2- by 3-inch pieces (reserve 4 cups of the soaking liquid) Flour for dredging 1/2 cup pure Spanish olive oil FOR THE SOFRITO: 1/4 cup pure Spanish olive oil 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 large onions, finely chopped 1 cup finely chopped drained pimientos 2 1/2 cups canned crushed tomatoes 1 tablespoon Spanish paprika or mild paprika 1/4 cup dry white wine Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste TO COMPLETE THE DISH: 4 medium-size all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices 3 pimientos, cut into strips, for garnish Fried Bread Rounds (recipe follows), as an accompaniment Notes: One day in advance of serving, rinse the salt cod under cold running water. Cut it into 2- by 3-inch pieces, place in a bowl, and cover with cold water. Change the water several times until it is no longer salty. This process should take 24 hours. Drain the fish, place it in a small saucepan, cover with fresh water, and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Drain and cool the fish. 1. Dredge the cod in the flour. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until fragrant, then cook the fish until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove the fish from the heat and set aside. 2. For the sofrito, in a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil until fragrant, then cook the bell peppers, stirring, until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic and onions, and cook, stirring, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes, adding more oil if necessary. Add the pimientos, tomatoes, paprika, and wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, another 10 to 12 minutes. 3. Place the reserved salt cod soaking water in a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat and cook the potato slices until partially tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 4. Add the codfish chunks to the sofrito and cook over low heat 10 minutes. Arrange the cooked potato slices on top of the fish, do not stir, cover the pan, and shake it several times. Cook over low heat an additional 10 minutes so that the potatoes absorb the fish flavor. Transfer to a large serving platter and garnish with the pimientos. Serve with Pan Frito (Fried Bread Rounds) and Arroz Blanco (see CUBA07.TXT). Makes 8 servings BACALAO A LA VISZCAINA File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

Change the water several times; drain thoroughly. Put the cod into a saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes or until fish is tender. Drain; skin and bone the fish. Flake with a fork into large pieces. Saute the onions in half the butter until they are tender and golden. Add the barlic. Boil the unpeeled potatoes in salted water. Once tender, remove from the heat, refresh in running cold water; then remove skins. Drain and slice into 1/4" pieces. Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 1-1/2 quart casserole with the remaining butter. Arrange a layer of half the potatoes, then half the cod, then half the onions. Sprinkle with a little pepper, and repeat layering. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top layer. Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through and lightly browned. Before serving, garnish with olives and eggs, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with wine vinegar and oil in cruets and pepper on the side. -- The Nero Wolfe Cookbook MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #44 From the MasterCook recipe list.

Milks and other liquids added to batters, soups or sauces should be brought to room temperature before you begin the recipe, or they can be heated briefly at a low setting in the microwave or in a pan of warm water. (Heating them directly takes longer and may scorch them.) Meats that are at room temperature cook faster and some meats can be more tender if the fat has had time to de-solidify.

    <ingredient>
      <li>6 large Baking potatoes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Chili powder</li>
      <li>Several dashes bottled hot pepper sauce</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Chopped Canadian-style bacon</li>
      <li>1 medium Tomato; finely chopped</li>

      <li>1 cup Shredded cheddar cheese or reduced-fat cheddar cheese; (4 ounces)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dairy sour cream; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Scrub potatoes thoroughly and prick with a fork. Arrange on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave, uncovered, on 100 percent power (high) for 17 to 22 minutes or till almost tender, rearranging once. (Or, bake potatoes in a 425Â° F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes or till tender.) Cool. Halve each potato lengthwise. Scoop out the inside of each potato half, leaving about a 1/4-inch-thick shell. (Cover and chill the leftover fluffy white part of potatoes for another use.) Combine the cooking oil, chili powder, and hot pepper sauce. With a pastry brush, brush the insides of the potato halves with the oil mixture. Cut the potato halves in half lengthwise. Return to the baking sheet. Sprinkle potato quarters with bacon, tomato, and green onion. Top with cheese. If desired, cover and chill for up to 24 hours. Bake in 450Â° F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes or till cheese is melted and potato quarters are heated through. Serve with sour cream, if desired. Makes 24 wedges. Make-Ahead Tip: Up to 24 hours ahead, prepare potato wedges, but do not bake. Cover and chill. To serve, bake potato wedges as directed.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Here are very, very simple ideas for dehydrated and light-weight foods. 1) Any packaged dinner mix from the grocery and packed in ziploc baggies ie, Macaroni &amp; Cheese, Rice-a-Roni, Broccoli and Cheese, etc There are tons of these things available today. If they call for milk, then the boys can carry powdered milk in baggies. Margarine will travel well, and since they will be working hard, the extra fat might be desireable. 2) Instant oatmeal and instant grits and bagels are great for breakfast. Again, powdered milk can be used with these. Get some of the new Fantastic Foods hot cereal mixes--they are warm and filling. 3) Dehydrated vegetables and full meals can be found in camping stores. Add dried peas to a box of mac &amp; cheese, for instance 4) Try Ramen noodle soups, or any of those "soup in a cup"s (that can be packaged in baggies so they take up less room). 5) Dehydrated bean flakes that mix up almost instantly with water are available in HFS. Mix these with some cooked minute rice and put in a tortilla. Yum! Flavor them with onion, garlic, cumin powders. 6) Cheese backpacks well. Again, the fat may not be so bad if they are hiking all day. And if it's cold, then the fat is almost necessary to help them stay warm. (You need a lot more calories when it's cold.) Add a hunk to any soup, pasta, rice, or dehydrated veggies you're cooking. 7) Pasta, pasta, pasta. Top it with sauces made from the dry package mixes. A lot of these are tasty. High in sodium and preservatives sometimes, but for a couple of meals they won't hurt you. 8) Instant mashed potatoes that can be mixed with the powdered milk or water only. Make up an instant gravy to go top. (I *really* like the Hain's brown gravy mix and it's fatfree and all natural.) 9) Dried fruit can be cooked in some water and put on top of a piece of angel food cake for dessert. (Hey, the cake might get crushed a little, but it is lightweight!) Add some cinnamon and Tang (in lieu of orange juice) and you approximate a Cooking Light recipe. 10) The dry veggie burger mixes would make a great meal. Most of them make up with water only and many are quite tasty. 11) Bulgar and couscous cook up in only a few minutes with boiling water. 12) There are lots of dried meats and fish available, but I've never used them As you can see, when we camp, I like to cook things that require water only. No fancy cooking and then tough clean up for me! I find that when I'm "on the trail", ALL foods taste wonderful because I'm always so hungry. I eat things when hiking that I'd never, ever eat at home. I bought hash potatoes and green pepper breakfast package from Sam's freezer and fried in black skillet for first morning quick and smells and taste good.

      <li>4 medium Tomatoes; coarsely chopped about 2 lbs, or two 14.4oz cans of tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Ham; chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Parsley; Italian, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Black Pepper</li>

      <li>1 pound Salt Cod; seenote</li>
      <li>4 Pickled chiles Jalapeno sliced into thin rings</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Liquid from pickled chiles</li>
      <li>12 Pimento-stuffed Green Olives sliced in half</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>MikeNote; Salt Cod, soak for 24 hours and Gently rinse, to remove most but not all of the salt. Do not break up fish. Put the potatoes in a large pan of cold, salted water, cutting any large potatoes in half or quarters first. Bring the water to a boil and simmer until the potatoes are just tender when pierced with a fork, 15-20 minutes. Drain and when cool enough to handle,, peel away the skin. Set aside. In a heavy pan such as a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, reduce the heat to very low and slowly saute about one hour. Stir occasionally, watching that the onion doesn't burn. A few dribbles more of oil may be necessary. Pre-heat oven to 300F degrees. Turn up the heat, add the garlic and tomato and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture becomes thick and the liquid is substantially reduced, about 10-15 minutes. Add the ham, parsley, pepper, cinnamon and cloves, then gently stir the cod, potatoes, jalapenos and their juice into the tomato mixture. Transfer to a 1 to 2 quart casserole, preferably clay, sprinkle with the olives and bake for 30 minutes. Bacalao a la Viscaina can be made ahead and re-heated in a 300F oven for 20 minutes or until thoroughly hot. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>This came from one of the other cookbooks I picked up last weekend. Nice segue, eh? Inherited from Spain, this codfish dish is a favorite of the Mexicans. Soak codfish for 8 hours in enough cold water to cover it. Drain and shred the fish. Saute the onion in the oil until it is softened. Add codfish and saute a few more minutes. Add the remaining ingredients. Simmer slowly until codfish is tender, about 1/2 hour or more. Makes 4 servings. From "The Art of Mexican Cooking" by Jan Aaron and Sachs Salom.

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Fresh ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound Smoked hot sausage</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>A fellow from the bayous of Louisiana came running up to me in an airport and shouted out a set of ingredients. He then explained it was a backwoods gumbo, the kind his grandma made for him when he was a boy. This is not as complex as a normal gumbo and therefore is easy to make. It is a good and frugal meal. Place the gizzards and necks in a 12-quart stockpot and add 3 to 4 quarts of water. Cover and simmer until tender, about 2 hours. Set aside to cool. Heat a large black frying pan and add the oil and flour. Stir over medium heat until the mixture becomes a peanut-butter- colored roux, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the celery, onion, green pepper, garlic, and tomatoes and cook, stirring all the time, until almost tender. Stir in the remaining ingredients except the sausage and the rice and simmer a few minutes until thickened. Strain the necks and gizzards from the kettle, reserving the broth. Place the poultry pieces and the vegetable mixture in the kettle, along with 2 quarts of the reserved broth. Stir over medium heat until the mixture thickens. Simmer for 30 minutes. Cut sausage into 1-inch pieces. Add the sausage and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve over 1/4 cup of cooked long-grain rice in each bowl. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Submitted by LynLord@aol.com Couscous is a great backcountry food (though really bland). You can boil water in any small pot, or even a tea kettle and just throw it in, and wham, it's done in minutes. This is a great little recipe that I often eat at home (shhhh). Simply prepare the couscous per usual, then pour in a heaping of the salad dressing to taste. Add the broccoli (I prefer it raw, but you can boil it if need be). Those little Nalgene bottles are great for keeping separate the salad dressing (Uncle Chang's brand is best), which you definitely don't want spilling over your pack contents...

    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 cups Milk</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Golden raisins</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Unsalted butter</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons Goat cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Rosemary, golden rasins, and a creamy goat cheese center make these muffins taste so special. Carla Wood, sous chef and butcher at Baby Routh in Dallas serves them with wild game, lamb, or pork dishes or with a festive luncheon salad. DIRECTIONS: =========== Simmer milk, raisins, and rosemary in a small saucepan for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter and stir until melted. Let cool. Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl. Beat egg into cooked milk mixture. Add to dry ingredients and mix lightly just until dry ingredients are moistened. Spoon 1/3 of the batter into 12 greased muffin cups. Place 2 teaspoons of goat cheee in center of batter in each cup. Cover cheese with remaining batter, dividing among each of the muffins. Bake approximately 20 minutes in a preheated 350 degree F oven, or until brown and springy in the center. Serve muffins hot or cool. If desired, a 3/4-inch cube of cream cheese may be substituted for goat cheese. Without cheese, muffins are still delicious! * Source: The Herb Garden Cookbook, by Lucinda Hutson * Typed for you by Karen Mintzias File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Leek Molds: Lightly oil 4 individual 1 cup souffle dishes, about 4" in diameter and 2" deep. Linewith clear plastic wrap, smoothing out wrinkles as much as possible and leaving ends extended over tops of dishes. Trim off leek tops so leeks are about 5" long. Blanch leeks in large pot of boiling water 2 to 3 minutes until leeks are tender but still retain their shape. Plunge into ice water. Cut bottom portions of leeks in lengths the same height as the souffle dishes, about 2". Stand leek pieces on end around inside edge of each souffle forming a leek "shell," with white portions of leeks toward bottom of dish. Set aside. Tomato Gelatin: Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in small saucepan to soften. Puree 16 cherry tomatoes in food processor. Sieve to remove seeds and skins. Add tomato puree to gelatin mixture. Stir over medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture almost boils. Reserve half the gelatin mixture at room temperature. Divide remaining gelatin mixture among the 4 souffle dishes. Cover and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Tomato Confit: While molds are setting, in large skillet, saute chopped onion in hot olive oil over medium high heat until soft. Add quartered cherry tomatoes. Cook, stirring constantly, until tomatoes are very soft and form a saucelike consistency. Remove from heat. Stir in basil, thyme, white vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste. Pour into bowl, and refrigerate to cool. Herbed Cream Filling: In small bowl, combine sour cream, chives, salt and pepper to taste. Assembly: Reserve half the tomato confit. Spoon remaining confit over set gelatin in souffle dishes. Top with a spoonful of cream filling in center, then cover with remaining tomato confit. Carefully spoon a layer of the remaining gelatin mixture atop each souffle. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours until set. To Serve: Gently loosen plastic wrap from sides of souffle with a knife. Lift gelatin molds out of souffles using extended ends of plastic wrap as "handles." Peel plastic wrap from sides. Lift molds off plastic wrap with a spatula and center each mold on a serving plate. Garnish each with 5 prawns and deep-fried vegetables, if desired.

      <li>1. Heat the oil in a heavy medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. 2. Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to mix. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to very low and cook, uncovered, stirring often, until the sauce thickens and has a smooth texture, 45 minutes to 1 hour. 3. Remove the onion and garlic with a slotted spoon and discard. Adjust seasonings to taste, and then, if sauce is too thick, add a small amount of water. Cook to blernd seasonings for 2 minutes. Cook to room temperature and refrigerate in covred containers for up to 1 week. Makes about 5 cups NOTES : I skipped direction #3 and put sauce in food processor with onions and garlic included and processed until smooth. MUCH better this way IMHO.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Here is the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Bread recipe from "Bread Machine Magic" by Lois Conway and Linda Rehberg aka "breakfast in a bread pan" for 1.5 pound loaf....... 1. In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove from pan, drain or pat with paper towels, and reserve the drippings, crumble the bacon. 2. Place all ingredients in bread pan, using the least amount of liquid listed in the recipe. Select light crust setting and press start. 3. Observe the dough as it kneads. After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry and stiff or if your machine sounds as if it is straining to knead it, add more liquid 1 tablespoon at a time until dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable ball that is slightly tacky to the touch. 4. After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Tamarind pulp</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoons Shallots; chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sherry vinegar</li>

      <li>1 Red onion</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>6 cups Spinach</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Ed Kasky, Executive Chef at Engine Co. No. 28, Los Angeles Preparation Time: 0:30 FOR THE DRESSING: Place the tomato paste, tamarind pulp, shallot, and vinegar in a blender an mix well. Slowly add the oil a drop at a time at first and then in a slow b steady stream until it is all incorporated. Add the salt. Can be kept in th refrigerator for 1 week. FOR THE ONIONS: Peel and slice one large red onion thick enough so that you can handle the slices and they will not fall apart when you cook them. Rub them with a little olive oil and cook the onions over a charcoal fire or under a hot broiler until soft. (Approximately 5 to 6 minutes per side.) Toss in a bowl with 1-1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar so that the slices become single rings. These will keep refrigerated 2 to 3 days. TO ASSEMBLE THE SALAD: Wash and dry one medium handful (about 1 cup) spinach for each portion and toss with enough dressing to coat each leaf, being careful not to over-dres the salad. Arrange the onions over the salad and serve. Always serve salads on chilled plates. CHEF'S NOTE: Tamarind pulp can be purchased at Latin specialty stores.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/4 cups Whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Corn meal</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 Egg, beaten</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Milk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"A tasty and nutritious teething cracker, far superior to anything you will find for sale at the supermarket. These make thoughtful gifts for babies and their parents. For an alternative baby teething cracker, try the Zwieback recipe on page 139. 325~F. 60 to 70 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F. In the food processor or in a large bowl, stir together the flour, corn meal, salt, and sugar. Add the egg and mix well. Blend in enough of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll into a rectangle about 3/8 inch thick. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 1-1/2- by 3-inch rectangles. Place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until the crackers are thoroughly dry. Cool on a rack. These crackers should be hard. If necessary, put them back in the oven for a few extra minutes. Yield: 10-15.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 23:05:20 -0400 From: Walt Gray &lt;waltgray@mnsinc.com&gt; CAKE: Mix all cake ingredients together. Bake in bundt or tube pan at 325 for one hour. Let cool slightly and remove from pan. Glaze when cool. GLAZE: Melt butter in saucepan. Stir in water and sugar. Boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat; add rum. In order to glaze the cake, first use a carving fork to poke holes in the top and sides of the cake. Slowly spoon glaze over cake. It will take a while for the cake to soak up all the glaze. Sometimes it is necessary to let the cake stand for five minutes or so in the midst of glazing so it can absord the liquid. Then continue to glaze the cake until the glaze is all used up.

      <li>Date: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 13:34:49 -0400 From: AKACarl@aol.com (Clare Shipman) Here is a recipe to make bagels in a bread machine. It should work equally well if hand kneaded the "old-fashioned" way. The bagels are chewy on the outside but not soggy or doughy on the inside. I slice them after they have cooled and store them in sealed plastic bags in the freezer. Place dough ingredients in bread machine per mfrs directions. Set bread machine on "dough" cycle. When machine signals, remove dough to well floured surface. Cut into 8 equal pieces and shape to make "doughnuts". Cover and let rest 20 minutes. In a large kettle, bring about a gallon of water with 1 Tblsp sugar to simmer. Set oven at 500 degrees. After bagels have rested 20 minutes, put in 500 degree oven for total of 5 minutes, turning once after 3 minutes. Remove bagels. Reduce oven setting to 350 degrees. Place 3 bagels in simmering water for total of 5 minutes, turning after three minutes. Remove 3 bagels from water. Drain on paper towel while simmering remaining bagels. Place simmered bagels on greased (Pam) baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees about 25 minutes until brown. FATFREE DIGEST V96 #108 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

      <li>1/4 cups Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>4 Parsnips; peeled, and cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>2 cups Hot parsnip puree</li>
      <li>1 cup Hot mashed potatoes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Note: See the "Emeril's Essence Information" recipe which is included in this collection. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Preheat the fryer. Season the monkfish with Emeril's Essence. Wrap three pieces of the bacon tightly around each piece of monkfish. In a large oven-proof saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the wrapped monkfish and sear the fish for 2 minutes on the first side. Flip the monkfish over and place the pan in the oven and roast for 6 to 8 minutes. Season the sliced vegetables with olive oil and Essence. Place the vegetables on the grill and cook for 2 minutes on each side. Remove the vegetables from the grill and dice. In a large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions and saute for 1 minute. Add the diced vegetables, shallots and garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Stir in the balsamic and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in the olives, tomatoes and stock. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Reseason if needed. Stir in the butter and remove from the heat. Place the parsnip strips in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 1 minute, stirring constantly to prevent the parsnips from sticking. Remove the parsnips from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the parsnips with salt and pepper. Combine the parsnip puree and mashed potatoes together. Mix well. To serve, spoon some of the parsnip-mash potatoes in the center of each plate. Lay each piece of monkfish directly on top of the potatoes. Spoon the sauce over the fish. Garnish each plate with a pile of fried parsnips, basil and cheese.

    <title>Bagel (Bb Site)</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Slightly warm water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Instant yeast</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Malt powder or syrup</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 1/2 1/2 cups bread flour; preferably unbleached , (up to 5)</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: KETTLE WATER</li>
      <li>6 quarts Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Malt syrup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Cornmeal for sprinkling; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Whisk together water, yeast, oil, sugar and malt. Stir in one cup of flour, then salt, then most of remaining flour. Knead 10-12 minutes to make a very stiff dough. Cover and let dough rest on a board about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line two large baking sheets with baking parchment and sprinkle generously with corn meal. Fill a large soup pot or Dutch oven three quarters full with water. Add the malt syrup and salt. Bring water to a boil. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Divide dough in 10 to 12 sections and form into 10 inch long strips. Roll the ends together to seal and make a ring. Place on a very lightly floured surface near your stove. Let bagels rest 15 to 20 minutes. Bagels should have a 'half proof' - they should rise halfway or appear puffy. Prepare two more baking sheets. Line one with a kitchen towel, the other with parchment paper which has been sprinkled with cornmeal (optional). Reduce water to simmer and add bagels a few at a time. Allow to come to surface and simmer thirty seconds. Turn over and cook other side about 45 seconds (total 1 1/2 minutes). Place on prepared, towel-lined baking sheet. Leave plain or sprinkle on topping of choice. Place in oven, reduce heat to 425 F. and bake until done, about 17-22 minutes, turning bagels once, when almost baked. If you have a baking stone, finish bagels on the stone directly. Yield: 10 to 12 bagels.

Preheat the oven to 160 oC (325 oF). In a flameproof earthenware casserole, heat the goose fat over low heat, put in the onions and sweat for several minutes. Lay the leek on top of the onions, then the potatoes. Add the 'bouquet garni', peppercorns and garlic and arrange the 3 meats separately on top, one type to the left, one in the middle, one in the right. Pour over the marinade and the remaining whine. Salt lightly, add the chicken stock and lay the pieces of calf's foot on top. Put the lid on the casserole. Mix the flour with a little cold water to make a soft paste. Spread this paste between the top of the casserole and the lid to make an airtight seal. Cook in the low oven for 4 hours. Present the casserole at the table just as is. Break the seal and lift off the lid. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Set for dough cycle.Let the machine knead the dough once, and then let the dough rise for only 20 minutes in the machine. Even if your cycle runs longer, simply remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off the machine. Divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces. Each piece should be rolled into a rope and made into a circle, pressing the ends together. You may find it necessary to wet one end slightly to help seal the ends together. Place these on a well greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring to a slight boil in a "nonaluminum pan", (Donna German uses a cast iron frying pan) about 2 inches of water. Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water, cooking for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a towel, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or dried onion bits if desired and place on the greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 550 degree oven for 8 minutes.

      <li>From: Kit Anderson &lt;kit@maine.com&gt; Date: Mon, 1 Jul 1996 13:24:27 -0400 Here is the recipe for my chili that appears in BeeR the magazine. I grew up all over the place and was introduced to hot food at a young age. My wanderings took me to Texas for a while. It was there I learned that true chili is not some form of bastardized spaghetti sauce or that abomination eaten with zeal in Cincinati. Chili is basic food. It is, in fact, one of the four food groups along with coffee, bagels, and beer. Meat, onions, chiles. What could be simpler, right? But then why is the perfect chili recipe so ellusive? Well, I'll tell ya. It's because people get too far away from the basics and mix in influences from cultures that have no business making chili. Cultures like New York and that large flat area between Pittsburgh and Denver. There are two styles of chili; Texas and New Mexico. Bad Attitude is from Texas. One aside. Watch the spelling. C-H-I-L-I is make with chile. C-H-I-L-E is (1) God's greatest gift to humans, (2) a country named after our favorite fruit, and (3) how mothers pronounce, " Chile! Gitchyer butt over here!" This recipe comes from years of Friday afternoons dedicated to cards-beer-blow-off-steam sessions while at dental school in south Texas. We used venison and pork, but any vertabrate is fine. (Armadillo is not allowed in Texas as it is the Official State Critter and has been granted asylum from the chili pot.) Vegetarian chili? Is that like jumbo shrimp? Military intelligence? Legal ethics? Painless dentist? Chili is not supposed to be blow you head off hot. I have two criteria for proper heat. (1) I should sweat under my eyes. (2) I should be able to eat the whole bowl without stopping to cool off. There is supposed to be a lot of chile flavor and no tomato flavor. This can only be had through high quality chile powder and fresh roasted peppers. To bean or not to bean? That is the question for people that like to discuss things like the meaning of life. Or how many angels can do the Cotton Eyed Joe on the head of a pin. Or is there a limit to Deion $anders' ego. If you are going to bean, pintos and black are good. Kidney beans are a sin. In time, this recipe has taken on life of its own. It has been know to change major weather patterns, cement faltering relationships, depose minor dictatorships, and affect the outcome of the Superbowl. Remember to use its power for good. Sautee 1/4 of the garlic and onions until translucent. Add 1/4 of the meat, chile powder and brown. Salt the meat while cooking. Put into your chili pot. Cast iron is best. Repeat until all the meat is done. Put the rest of the ingredients in you chili pot and simmer for for a hour. As in any recipe, the amount of ingredients is variable. Add more of anything you want, especially chiles. You now have the power. Use it wisely. The eyes of Texas are upon you! CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #031 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>This one is from New Hampshire. My lady friends there told me that they had this for breakfast often as little girls. While I don't want you eating bacon every morning, there is something to be said for a few slices of old-fashioned cured New England bacon. A lot can be said! The cream sauce can be made a day or two ahead and then warmed in the microwave in no time. Place the bacon on the toast and top with cream sauce. Then pour black coffee and open the windows so that you can smell the fresh New Hampshire air. (This works best if you are in New Hampshire!) From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>1 2 8oz. cream cheese*</li>
      <li>1 pound Bacon** (each slice cut in half)</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Split, seed and wash jalapeno peppers. Spread cream cheese in each half of split peppers, either leave in halves *OR* combine the two halves to make a whole popper. Wrap each half/whole jalapeno with a bacon slice cut in half. Place each bacon wrapped jalapeno on a cookie sheet..bake at 250 til bacon is done, cool and serve.(Cheese will boil out if oven is set to high) This is even better cold the next day!!! I should have posted these for Super bowl Sunday...good with beer,wine and margaritas. *I have used fat free and low fat cream cheese, the amount varies as to how much cheese each individual likes in their jalapeno. **I use Turkey bacon for the wrap and it is really good, less fat too.

      <li>1. Heat 2tb oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the potatoes until they turn medium brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. (Omit this step for a lower-fat dish.) 2. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pan and heat over medium low heat. Fry bay leaf, red chili, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves for a few seconds. Add onion and fry until richly browned but not burnt, 18 to 20 minutes, stirring constantly. 3. Stir in ginger, garlic, green chili, turmeric, cumin, and sugar. Add meat and water. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Add the potatoes and simmer, covered, until both meat and potatoes are tender, about 30 more minutes. Turn heat very low. Blend in yogurt, nuts, and salt and remove from heat. (Prolonged heating will curdle the sauce, detracting from its appearance and texture.) Stir in garam masala.
