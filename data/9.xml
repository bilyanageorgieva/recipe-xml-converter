      <li>4 pounds tri-tip or bottom sirloin, trimmed and cut in 1/4 inch cubes. 1) Combine all dry ingredients in a small container. Clean tomatoes of seeds and put through sieve or chop finely. Combine tomatoes, broth water and dry spices in a bowl, mix well. Put into a chilli pot and simmer. 2) Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute onions and garlic in a little water over low heat for 30 minutes. Drain and add to tomato sauce and simmer 30 minutes. 3) In a large skillet, cook meat until no longer pink, drain off juices and add to chilli pot. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until meat is tender. Adjust seasoning with salt and add Tabasco if hotter chilli is desired. Cooking time - 3 hours or longer (start to finish) All typos are my fault. Burning the meat is your fault.

      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Yeast</li>
      <li>3 cups Bread flour</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: mackey.1@osu.edu (Lynda Mackey) Date: 29 Sep 1994 21:46:42 GMT This recipe won first place in a special competition at the Ohio State Fair this year: Cooking with Ohio's Soy Foods, sponsored by the Ohio Soybean Council. It also received an "award of Excellence" rosette. You can also use this recipe in a bread machine, either by going through the whole cycle, or by using the dough setting and shaping the dough into a large braid, which is what I usually do.. If you're not wild about soy, you can change the soy milk to water, and the soy oil to another kind of oil. Instructions: 1. Mix the soy milk, honey, and yeast and set it aside for 10 minutes. 2. Combine the bread flour and soy flour in a large bowl. 3. Add the oil, eggs, and egg yolk to the milk, honey, and yeast mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until blended. 4. Add the flours to the liquid mixture, stir until a dough is formed, and turn the dough out onto a floured board. 5. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. 6. Form into a ball, coat with a bit of soybean oil, and place in a covered bowl. 7. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour. 8. Punch the dough down, knead about 3 minutes, and braid or shape into any desired form. 9. Transfer to a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. 10. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 11. Beat the egg white with a folk. Use a brush to coat the top of the loaf. Sprinkle poppy seeds on top of loaf. 12. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. 13. Cool on a rack. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <title>"When the Shepherd Is in a Hurry" Pie</title>
    <category>Beef</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Ground beef</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; chopped fine</li>
      <li>1/2 packages Lipton's onion soup mix or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 To 1 1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1 To 2 tbsp flour</li>
      <li>1 16 oz pkg frozen corn, green beans, carrots</li>
      <li>Whichever you prefer</li>
      <li>8 10 servings instant mashed potatoes</li>
      <li>Made per box directions</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>First, brown your ground beef and onion over medium-high heat. Add the onion soup to taste and the water. You can add more and taste it as the mix tends to be salty. Cook this mixture about 5-10 minutes and add pepper if you like. Push the ground beef to one side of the pan and sprinkle the flour in while stirring the broth briskly. Careful here! It will lump quite easily. The idea is to make a gravy and if you like, you can dissolve the flour in a little cold water before stirring in. Bring back to a boil and add more water if you like a thinner gravy. Pour this meat mixture into a large casserole dish such as a 13x9 oblong baking pan. Add the frozen vegetables and top with the prepared mashed potatoes. Bake about 30-40 minutes, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven. Serves well with a simple salad and about 6 hungry people, possibly with some left for lunch the next day. Reheats well.

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>~-----------------------MMMM-------------------SPROU----------------------- ~ ~-----------------------INFORMATION---------------------------------------- ~ You can purchase a sprouting jar (available at most health food stores) or you can make your own. To make your own get a 1/2 gallon clear glass container. Be sure to wash it out well. Cover the mouth with a fine screen and use a rubber band to keep it on. That's it. Really though, the purchased jars are inexpensive and are made just for the purpose. ** How to sprout seeds 1.) Place measured amount of seed, beans, or grain into sprouting jar. Add water and soak overnight following chart recommendations below. 2.) Pour off soak water and place jar mouth down at 45 degree angle for drainage and ventilation between rinsings, then rinse twice a day with fresh cool water. 3.) After sprouts have matured (see chart below) place them in a bowl of water. Seed hulls will float to the top and dprouts will sink. Skim hulls off with your hand and discard them. Gently remove sprouts from bowl and drip drain before storing them in a glass or plastic (closed) container or bag in the refridgerator. 4.) Place Alfalfa, Mustard, Cabbage, Clover, and Radish in indirect light for two days before harvesting to develop chlorophyll. Use the sprouts in preparing your next meal, in salads and sandwiches. ** Sprouting tip The ideal sprouting temperature is between 65~ and 75~. Sprouts grow best in darkness or indirect light. When sprouted too long some seeds and beans may become bitter. Grains become sweeter on the fourth and fifth day of sprouting. Start new seeds every 3 days for a continuous suppy. ** Sprouting Chart Variety Soaking Time Dry Measure Ready in (hours) QT. 1/2 gal (days) Alfalfa 8 3 TB 6 TB 4-5 Clover 8 4 TB 8 TB 4-5 Mustard 8 1/4 cup 1/2 cup 4-5 Sesame 8 1/2 cup 3 cups 2-3 Sunflower 8 2 cups 4 cups 2-3 Lentils 12 1/2 cup 1 cup 2-5 Mung 12 1/2 cup 2 cups 3-5 Green Peas 12 1 cup 2 cups 2-3 Wheat &amp; Rye 12 1 cup 2 cups 2-3 Sprouting info and chart From: Rainbow Acres Natural Foods 13208 Washington Boulevard Los Angeles, CA 90066 (Manufacturers of great sprouting jars) Formatted by: Dorie Villarreal</li>

      <li>&gt;&gt;From: Claudia Parras (tamale@aloha.net) The very idea of healthier (less fat and no cholesterol) mandelbread made me pause, but I made this recipe as gift for a friend who is concerned about such things and misses the traditional sort. I found the taste to be pleasant, and I hope that you will also find it so! Preheat oven to 350 F. Coat two baking sheets with a nonstick vegetable spray. In a medium bowl, beat oil, sugar, egg substitute and extracts. Add flour and baking powder and mix well. Stir in nuts and chocolate chips, if using. Batter will be stiff and sticky. Divide batter into 4 parts. Lay out in four thin loaf shapes, 10 inches long by 1-1/2 inches. Spread the pieces out so they do not touch and continue baking until the pieces are brown, about another 10 to 12 minutes, being careful they do not burn on the bottom. Makes 40.

      <li>This is a no brainer; I also don't have any measurements. I just punt. In one shallow bowl, mix some "creamer" and egg beaters (obviously, you can use full fat creamer and real eggs) and in the other, mix the matzo meal and corn flake crumbs and seasonings. Skin the chicken and first dip in liquid and then in crumb mixture. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray foil with oil. put chicken on foil and then spray all the chicken with oil spray. Bake in oven at 350 degrees until done. best when prepared the day before and reheated; it gets crunchier. Also good cold or at room temp.

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dry yeast</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place into the bread machine in the order given. Place on dough or pizza cycle. Both work well. Remove when finished and shape into a round in a pie pan which is oiled. Let rise approximately 30 minutes. For pizza bread...put finger holes in top. Rub with olive oil, salt and pepper. Bakeat 400 degrees 20-25 minutes. (This produces a flatten bread which I believe ended up being named Foccaccio! with some additional toppings.) For a loaf of bread, I do the same thing, except that I do not punch holes in the top. I lightly rub the top with olive oil...not necessary and bake at 400 degrees. For pizza....this will yield two pans of thin crust. Top and bake this at 425 degrees. NOTES : This bread is not good baked in the bread machine.

Place meat in the cool marinade and leave overnight, or for no less than 8 hours. Remove from brine and allow to air dry without rinsing. Smoke in your smoker for 12 to 16 hours or until jerky has dried out to your liking. Use your favorite fuel for smoking.

    <recipetext>
      <li>The "trick" in this Syrian-Lebanese vegetable soup is that there's no meat in the kibbeh "meatballs." The idea that a vegetarian dish is a deception (vegetarian dolmas are known as yalanji, the Turkish word for "counterfeit") goes back at least 1,200 years in the Near East. In bowl, mix bulgur, flour, 1/2 tablespoon salt, cinnamon, green onions, mint and parsley. Add enough water to make thick dough. Rolls into 24 very firmly packed balls the size of large marbles. Set aside to dry. Put 9 cups chicken stock in pot, add lentils and bring to boil 10 minutes. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons, reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, 20-25 minutes. Add bulgur balls and boil 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, garlic and oil. Simmer until balls are done, 10 minutes. Garnish with thin lemon slices.

      <li>This comes from a great cookbook that was given to me for Christmas many years ago "Christmas Memories Cookbook" by Mystic Seaport Members. Many of the recipes in it are fabulous and have become Christmas traditions, as well as recipes used all year long. The theme of the book is a Victorian Christmas, but few of the recipes are actually identified as Victorian. Here's one I could find. If I find more, I'll post them. A 100-year old recipe. The mystery is ours. Who drank the wine? 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees 2. Cream well the shortening, sugar and egg 3. In medium bowl, combine dry ingredients. In another bowl combine milk and molasses 4. Add flour and milk mixture. Add raisins 5. Drop by spoonsful onto lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 15 minutes 6. While still warm from the oven, dust with confectioners' sugar One thing the book says is that there were no before dinner drinks or appetizers. They apparently were not seen in the US until WW1. There may be more suggestions that would help you in the book. If you have any questions, e-mail me privately.

In smaller skillet (or same skillet after vegetables are cooked), heat small amount of oil and quickly cook chicken shreds until done. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 3. Serve both over plate of sticky rice drizzled with a good store-bought terriyaki sauce. NOTES : Other vegetables to add: carrots, broccoli, celery, bok choy. I like the cabbage well-done, but the beansprouts added at the very last minute so they're hot, but still crunchy.

      <li>I use this very simple recipe from the The American vegetarian cookbook: from the fit for life kitchen. You can use this recipe instead of the ricotta in this way or you can mix it through your (home made) tomato sauce. Blend 3/4 of the tofu with the nutmeg and salt. Add some water to smooth. Mash the rest of the tofu through with a fork. Posted to fatfree digest by "Boxel" &lt;boxel@sr.net&gt; on May 21, 1998</li>

      <li>Date: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 20:16:45 -7 From: arlenes@holly.ColoState.EDU The "trick" in this Syrian-Lebanese vegetable soup is that there's no meat in the kibbeh "meatballs." The idea that a vegetarian dish is a deception (vegetarian dolmas are known as yalanji, the Turkish word for "counterfeit") goes back at least 1,200 years in the Near East. In bowl, mix bulgur, flour, 1/2 tablespoon salt, cinnamon, green onions, mint and parsley. Add enough water to make thick dough. Rolls into 24 very firmly packed balls the size of large marbles. Set aside to dry. Put 9 cups chicken stock in pot, add lentils and bring to boil 10 minutes. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons, reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, 20-25 minutes. Add bulgur balls and boil 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, garlic and oil. Simmer until balls are done, 10 minutes. Garnish with thin lemon slices.

      <li>Bake according to manufacturer's instructions. Author's notes: "Semolina flour has a very high gluten content, and therefore makes an exceptional loaf. Expect a yellow-tinted interior and a well-developed wheat flavor." My notes: I made this bread 6/3/96. I used durum wheat flour instead of semolina. Barney unplugged my machine, so I had to finish the second rise, and bake it in the real oven. It turned out great. This bread is not sweet, it has almost a "sour" taste. Holds up nice for sandwiches. I'll make it again. Posted to MealMaster Recipes List, Digest #166 Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 14:49:42 -0400 From: Sleopo@aol.com</li>

    <title>"The" Onion Soup</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Onions;thinly sliced, 5-6 lg</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 large Clove garlic; thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>2 quarts Beef stock; hot</li>
      <li>2 cups Dry red wine; good quality</li>
      <li>1 dash Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 pinch Thyme</li>
      <li>Black pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 French bread loaf; sliced in 1-inch croutes</li>
      <li>1 pound Gruyere cheese; diced small</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese; fresh grate</li>
      <li>Butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt the butter and olive oil together in a heavy, 4-quart soup pot. Add the onions, cover, and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Raise the heat to moderate, uncover pan, and add sugar and salt. Cook 20 to 30 minutes longer, stirring frequently, until the onions have turned a rich, mahogany brown. Reduce heat to low, add the garlic, and cook 1 minute. Blend in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and blend in 1 cup of hot stock, making sure the flour is completely dissolved. Stir in the remaining stock, the wine, vinegar, thyme, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer slowly, cover slightly ajar, for 30 minutes. Add bay leaf the last 15 minutes, discarding it at the end of cooking time. Taste for seasonings and adjust as needed. NOTE: The soup can be prepared several days in advance (in fact, it improves with age), but if you are planning to serve it gratinee, have your guests clamoring at the table as you remove it from the broiler, or the crust will sink like a leaky barge. Therefore: Preheat the broiler. Smear a bit of butter in the bottom of individual earthenware (or other heatproof) bowls, and place them on a cookie sheet. Place a croute on the bottom of each bowl and sprinkle generously with Gruyere. Repeat this procedure in each bowl. Ladle in the simmering soup. Float another croute on top of each serving, sprinkle on more Gruyere and a drift of Parmesan. Drizzle with a bit of melted butter, and whisk the bowls under the preheated broiler for a few minutes. Watch carefully. When the cheese is crusty and the soup bubbling, serve immediately. AFTERTHOUGHTS: Serve the soup with bruschetta or garlic croutons. Try bruschetta smeared with a little dijon mustard and topped with Brie in place of the Gruyere croutes. If you're feeling like a high roller, add a dash of Cagnac to each serving when you ladle on the soup. If you're concerned about your weight, serve the soup unadorned except for a sprinkling of fresh minced parsley. Pass thin bruschetta or lightly toasted French bread and a small bowl of grated Parmesan at the table. You may also wish to serve the soup from a tureen. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until brown and crusty. And do try the redoubtable Julia Child's version: a couple of egg yolks beaten with 4 or 5 tablespoons of port or Madeira, poured under the edge of the crust, and gently stirred just before serving. (Divide this amount among bowls if serving them individually.)

      <li>Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1996 18:30:04 +0000 From: "Asha Dornfest" &lt;asha@hopf.dnai.com&gt; I just wanted to thank everyone for their inspired burrito suggestions. I will try them all! Until then, I have come up with a surprisingly delicious no-brainer - the naked burrito. Yes, it's a burrito without a tortilla. 1. Dump cooked brown rice in a bowl. 2. Top with beans of choice (heated pinto, black, or ff refried, canned OK). 3. Spoon on a dollop or two of salsa (this is the ingredient that will make or break the dish, so go for something really good). 4. Top with shredded vegies and condiments of choice (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are a must, but after that, there are no rules. Steamed assorted vegies, ff cheese and/or yogurt, etc) Enjoy! This meal is fast, delicious, colorful, and will satisfy most burrito cravings. btw, I made an amazing discovery I'm sure I've mentioned before, but it's worth saying again: Safeway's "Southwest Salsa" (bottled) is the best prepared salsa I've ever tried. I am a real snob about jarred salsa, usually preferring to make my own. But I love this stuff! If you haven't tried it, do. It's good. The Medium level of hotness is just perfect in my opinion.

      <li>Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 13:09:00 -0400 (EDT) From: Larry Hunter &lt;hunter@intr.net&gt; About 15 years ago, the first restaurant with genuinely spicy food arrived in lovely New Haven, CT (where I was going to college). It was officially called "Threshold", although we all called it "Threshold of Pain". They sold Schezwan food at 1 through 5 "alarms". When you ordered Kung Pao chicken at 5 alarm (which I did often), there were more chiles than peanuts in the dish. Unfortunately, the restaurant folded in less than a year. Here's an attempt to recreate that 5 alarm recipe. It needs to be scaled up to restaurant portions, but it's not a difficult dish. You can reduce the amount of dried chile to reduce the heat level to mainstream levels if absolutely necessary. Make the marinade: Mix all ingredients and stir to dissolve cornstarch. Add chicken and marinate 30 minutes or longer. Mix sauce and set aside. Heat a bit peanut oil in the wok until just shy of smoking. Add chicken and stir fry until it is cooked and turns white. Remove and set aside. Add more oil to the wok, and reheat until almost smoking. Stir fry red peppers until they are crisp and start to turn black. Add ginger and garlic and stir fry for about 10 seconds, stirring constantly. Add the sauce, stirring constantly until slightly thickened. Add the chicken and stir until tyhe chicken is heated through and the sauce is thick. Remove from heat and stir in the peanuts. Serve over white rice, garnished with chile and scallion slices.

Add the habaneros (I roasted mine first), the diced tomatoes (okay, I added the extra two cans to cut the heat down a bit, so if you want it super hot you can eliminate the cans or a couple of the habaneros), lime and lemon juices, coriander, oregano, sugar, salt and pepper.

    <ingredient>

      <li>3 tablespoons Oil or shortening</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups hot water (up to 1)</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Each: flour; water</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 2 1/2 hours Yield: 8 servings This subtly sweet stew comes from "Modern Meat Lore," one of the pamphlets the Tribune published under the pen name of Mary Meade, the "cooking editor" at the newspaper. Flank steak isn't the economical cut it was in 1939; feel free to substitute other cuts suitable for stewing, such as chuck. 1. Place apricots in a small bowl and cover with hot water; let soak until plump, about 20 minutes. Drain and reserve. 2. Heat oil or shortening in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown meat, in batches if necessary to prevent crowding. Reduce heat to low. Return all meat and any accumulated juices to pan. Add hot water; simmer, covered, about 2 hours. 3. Stir in apricots, celery, salt, pepper, onion and lemon zest; simmer, covered, until meat is tender, about 30 minutes. Mix flour with water until smooth; add to stew mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until stew thickens, about 5 minutes. Serve over rice. Note: We added 2 teaspoons fresh thyme along with the other seasonings.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Beaumont Inn Heat butter and add flour. Whisk and slowly cook for 5 minutes. Whisk in cream and milk and heat. Whisk in cheese until melted. Season. Simmer for 30 minutes. Sauce should be very thick. Quarter toast and place in an oven safe dish. Top with turkey and tomatoes. Cover well with sauce. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Garnish with bacon. Note: This is a regional favorite that originated at Louisville's Brown Hotel earlier in this century. Many variations can be found, most commonly country ham is added and a cheddar sauce is substituted. This is our version which I feel is closer to the original recipe. It is offered on our lunch menu. Entered for you by: Bill Webster Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #835 by Bill Webster &lt;thelma@pipeline.com&gt; on Oct 10, 1997</li>

      <li>''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' '' Preheat oven to 400 deg F. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter until it dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the dry ingredients and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead for a minute or so. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll out to to fit the bottom of a pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2 lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until dough is golden brown. In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining 3 T sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use. Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch. Place 1 round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top with the other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best served fresh and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly beaten heavy cream if you'd like. Sprinkle sliced strawberries with sugar; set aside. Beat milk with lemon juice until thick. Fold in strawberries and whipped cream. Divide among crepes; fold. Garnish with additional whipped cream and a strawberry centered on the cream. Yields 6 servings. Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir until gelatin is completely dissolved. Combine yogurt, sugar, and salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in berries and lemon juice. Chill until slightly thickened; beat until foamy. Fold in whipped cream. Pour mixture in metal ice-cube tray. Cover with foil; freeze. NOTE: I have also made this with approx 1/2 of 1 pint of fresh strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream maker. Delicious! * hulled, cleaned, and halved Combine strawberries and sugar. Cover; let stand 15 minutes. Prepare topping. Beat together yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, and brandy until smooth.

      <li>Combine butter and flour in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly with a wire whip until the flour smells cooked (it will have no smell until it is cooked) and it is light golden color. Remove roux from heat. Bring milk to a simmer in another saucepan. Using the wire whip, thoroughly incorporate the roux into the milk. Add nutmeg, salt and pepper. Strain the sauce through a sieve until there are no tiny lumps. Dot the top of the sauce with melted butter to prevent skim from forming. This sauce is used to make "Sauce Nantua" and "Broccoli with Mornay Sauce" (both in this cookbook).

    <category>Main dish</category>
    <category>Nuts</category>
    <category>Poultry</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 3.5 to 4 lb. chicken cut in pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lime juice; freshly squeezed</li>
      <li>2 Limes; minced zest of</li>
      <li>2 small Onions peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Mild honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh ginger; minced</li>
      <li>1 Fresh serrano or jalapeno with seeds; minced</li>
      <li>4 Carambola (4 oz. each)* cut in 1/4" thick slices</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Almonds; raw and whole</li>
      <li>1 small Cilantro bunch; to garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*When you buy carambola, also called star fruit, look for ones that are uniformly yellow to orange and have a subtle perfume. If they are green, they aren't ripe and won't yield a great deal of flavor. At their ripest, their flavor is an unmistakably tropical combination of apple, banana and lychee. Rinse chicken well and pat it thoroughly dry. In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, lime juice and zest, onions, honey, ginger and minced pepper. Stir in three-fourths of the carambola slices. Then add the chicken, and turn it until it is coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 2 days, turning the chicken occasionally so it marinates evenly. Arrange chicken in a single layer in a 9 x 13" baking dish; season generously with salt. Add almonds to the marinade, stir, and spoon it over the chicken. Bake at 375 F. in the center of the oven, basting frequently with pan juices and turning any chicken pieces that get too brown, about 35 minutes. Add remaining carambola, stir, and continue cooking until the chicken is golden and a thigh yields clear juice when pricked at its thickest part, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. Just before serving, mince the cilantro if you are using it. Serve chicken right from the baking dish, or divide among four warmed dinner plates. Spoon sauce over the chicken, garnish with cilantro and serve. This dish can be prepared up to 2 days in advance. Goes well with a semi-dry German Kabinett, such as Deirhard 1989. Loomis writes: "Becky Campbell became a tropical fruit aficionado through the career of her husband, Carl, who is an internationally known tropical fruit expert. He researched and taught at the University of Florida, where he is now professor emeritus. She became an expert on cooking with tropical fruits, and lectured and taught cooking classes for years. Together they developed a small tropical fruit orchard in the backyard of their home near Homestead, Florida. "Becky refers to the tropical fruit orchard that surrounds their single-story home as a 'mini experiment station.' Her husband does the experimenting, and she brings the bounty into the kitchen. Their orchard produces everything from Key limes and carambola to black sapote and mangoes. "Becky and Carl were recently in Uganda, where carambola is as common as green grapes are here. There she picked up valuable tips for using the lovely star-shaped fruit, and she set out samples for us to taste: golden star-shaped slices of dried carambola, carambola leather and carambola preserves, where the stars were suspended in a thick sweet syrup. They were all delicious." From _Farm House Cookbook_ by Susan Herrmann Loomis. New York: Workman Publishing Company, Inc., 1991. Pp. 145-146. ISBN 0-89480-772-2. Electronic format by Cathy Harned.

    <ingredient>
      <li>5 large Flour Tortillas -- (or 6)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped Onion</li>
      <li>16 ounces Can Refried Beans</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Salsa -- * see note</li>
      <li>12 ounces Can Green Enchilada Sauce** see note</li>
      <li>1 1/2 To 2 Cups Cheddar Cheese shredded</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* I use a 14 oz. can of Food Club Diced Tomatoes with Green Chilies. ** or red enchilada sauce if desired Drain the salsa. In a medium bowl mix the refried beans, salsa and onion. Warm the tortillas. Grease a 9 X 12 inch baking dish. Now, spread about 1/4 cup of the refried bean mixture evenly over 3/4 of one tortilla. Sprinkle with a little cheese and roll the tortilla starting with the part covered with refried beans. Place with the end of the roll down in the baking dish length-wise. Continue with the other tortillas until the baking dish is filled (I can usually fit six in the dish.) Pour the enchilada sauce over the top of the tortillas evenly and sprinkle with remaining 3/4 - 1 cup of cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Viva la enchilada! This is one of Brandon and I's favorites. I came up with this simple recipe a couple of years ago while in college. It costs about $4.75 and lasts for two meals for us. It also takes very little time to prepare. You can top it with any of your favorite toppings too; guacamole, sour cream, black olives and shredded lettuce. Enjoy!

      <li>Source: "Garden Fresh Cooking" Organic Gardening Magazine, January, 1998 Scrub the beets and trim off their tails and crowns. Chop, shred or slice the other vegetables. Beets can be messy, so grate them last (and don't wear a white shirt!). In a large stockpot, saute the onion in margarine for a few minutes, then add the caraway and the rest of the vegetables. Add the stock and the remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer for 40 to 45 minutes, testing occasionally for doneness. If you use fresh dill, add it at the very end. Once cooked, you can puree this soup in a blender or food processor for more delicate texture. Serve hot, garnished with a dollop of sour cream or a sprig of dill.

      <li>This versatile mixture is excellent fare for serving a casual crowd. It makes a good filling for burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas, and is especially convenient for last-minute suppers because it freezes well, too. I like to roll it up in warm flour tortillas with shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped scallions, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Makes 8 to 10 servings Preparation: 1. In a 5- or 6-quart electric slow cooker, mix together the beans, hot water, tomatoes with their liquid, green chiles, garlic, cumin, chili powder, oregano, coriander, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and beef. 2. Cover and cook on the high heat setting 1 hour. Reduce the heat to the low setting and cook, covered, 8 hour longer, or until the beans and beef are tender. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.

    <title>Bechamel Sauce</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 small Spanish onion; peeled</li>
      <li>1 Nutmeg; small piece</li>
      <li>6 Cloves; whole</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Unsalted butter; clarified</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Hot milk</li>
      <li>Salt and white pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make a cut into the onion, about 1 inch deep, and slide the bay leaf into this slit. Stick the cloves into the onion, and place it, along with the milk and nutmeg, into a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan. Place this over medium heat. In a separate pan, cook the butter and flour for about 5 minutes, stirring continuously, without browning, until it emits a nutty aroma. Remove from the fire. When the milk is fairly hot, pour some into the cooled down roux, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt and white pepper, strain, and set aside until ready to use. Bechamel has a tendency to form a skin on top, in part because of its exposure to the air. To prevent this, take a piece of butter, impaled on a fork, and dab it on top of the sauce. This will leave a thin coating of butter on the top of the sauce which prevents a skin from forming. Bechamel is typically served with hard-boiled eggs (served hot); as a binder and vehicle for grating; poached fish (served hot); and light meat. TRADITIONAL DERIVATIVES OF BECHAMEL SAUCE Aurora Sauce (Sauce Aurore) cream sauce blended with tomato puree. Aurora sauce is typically served with poached, soft-boiled, and hard-boiled eggs (served hot). Avignon Sauce (Sauce Avignonaise) Cream sauce flavored with garlic, seasoned with grated Parmesan cheese, finished with an egg yolk liaison, and garnished with chopped parsley. Brantome Sauce Cream sauce flavored with a reduction of shallot, white wine, and oyster liqueur, mounted with crayfish butter, seasoned with cayenne pepper, and garnished with grated truffle. Bread Sauce (Sauce au Pain a l'Anglaise) Milk heated with an onion cut in half, simmered with grated fresh bread crumbs, onion removed, seasoned with salt, cayenne, and nutmeg, finished with cream, and mounted with butter. Cardinal Sauce (Sauce Cardinale) Cream sauce flavored with fish stock and truffle essence, sea-soned with cayenne pepper, and mounted with lobster butter. Cardinal sauce is typically served with shellfish, though it can also be served with other braised or baked fish. The name is derived from the connection between the bright red robes of a church cardinal and the bright red color of crab, crayfish, lobster, and shrimp shells when cooked.

      <li>Funny you should ask about juicing. I just got my juicer out last week and decided to use it. I went to the library and checked out a book named "Juicing for Life" by Cherie Calbom and Maureen Keane. It is a guide to the health benefits of fresh fruits and vegetable juicing. It has alot of recipes for juice combinations. I have been using it for about a week. I think I'm going to like it. Here are a couple of recipes to get you started but you should go check it out.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash and dry potatoes. Wrap in aluminum foil and bake 60 minutes in 400 degree oven or until tender. Remove and allow to cool slightly. With sharp knife shave off small slice through potato and foil. This will allow a small hole to scoop out and re-stuff potatoes. Scoop out potatoes carefully. Mash scooped-out potatoes and whip together with grated cheese and onion. Add milk only to moisten. Whipping with mixer will make stuffing fluffy. Add salt and pepper. Stuff into foil-wrapped shells. Garnish tops with grated cheese and parsley flakes. Bake in a 350 degree oven until cheese browns. Serve right out of the oven. Serves 6. From &lt;A Taste of Louisiana&gt;.

      <li>*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into thin slices **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with marinade and marinate for 30 minutes. Heat wok over highest heat, when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp peanut oil. Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds. Add broccoli and stirfry one minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and steam until crisp tender. Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated. Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and, when hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until lightly browned but not cooked through. Do not stirfry too vigorously or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices against sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss. When hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (it's a good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into the wok). Turn onto a 02/24/92 4:15 PM platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top. The sugar in the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a floor enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope you enjoy this recipe.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This tid-bit of the old time trappers will be tasted by few of the younger generation. Broil the beaver tail over hot coals for a few minutes (or in one of those new electric ovens). The rough scaly hide will blister and come off, leaving the tail clean, white and solid. Then roast or boil until tender. This is considered very strengthening food (use only young beaver). For a special treat, cool, souse in vinegar, add raw onion rings, salt and pepper to taste.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into thin s **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with marinade and marinate for 30 minutes. Heat wok over highest heat, when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp peanut oil. Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds. Add broccoli and stirfry one minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and steam until crisp tender. Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated. Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and, when hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until lightly browned but not cooked through. Do not stirfry too vigorously or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices against sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss. When hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (it's a good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into the wok). Turn onto a platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top. The sugar in the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a floor enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope you enjoy this recipe.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 cup Long-grain brown rice</li>
      <li>1 Stalk fresh lemongrass</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Light oil</li>
      <li>1 Jalapeno pepper; cored, seeded, and finely diced (1 tablespoon)</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic; peeled, bashed, and finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Red bell pepper; cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Celery; cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Grated gingerroot</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped fresh pineapple (1/4-inch dice)</li>
      <li>12 Mint leaves; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Loosely packed cilantro leaves, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Thai fish sauce or tamari</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR GARNISH</li>
      <li>6 Sprigs fresh mint</li>
      <li>6 Sprigs cilantro</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, boil the rice in 4 cups of water for 25 minutes, or until just tender. Drain through a sieve and rinse with cold water to wash off the starch and cool the rice. Spread the rice in a flat metal pan and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This is a dish that cooks quite quickly from this point on, so it's important to have all the ingredients prepared and ready at hand. Remove the tough outside layer of the lemongrass and cut off the root end and the dry top. Start slicing from the root end and use only the most tender, bulb-like part of the stalk. Slice thinly and chop very fine so the flavor will be spread throughout. You should have about 1/4 cup, chopped. Warm the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Saute the lemongrass, chiles, and garlic for 30 seconds to release the aromatic oils. Add the red pepper, celery, and ginger and stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Add the chilled rice and cook until heated through, stirring occasionally to keep it form sticking. Add the pineapple, mint, and cilantro to the hot rice. Sprinkle the fish sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil over the top. (Vegetarian Option: Substitute tamari for the fish sauce.) Stir to mix and serve immediately. Garnish with sprigs of mint and cilantro.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Milk</li>
      <li>2 ounces Unsweetened chocolate</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar for serving, if desired</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. If you plan to bake the brownies, and butter a 9-inch square baking pan. Otherwise, preheat a waffle iron. In a small bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda and salt. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, butter and milk. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring until the butter has melted. Remove from the heat. Add the unsweetened chocolate and vanilla. Stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Place into a pan of cold water to cool the mixture to room temperature. With an electric mixer, beat in the eggs. Gradually blend in the flour mixture until smooth. (Spread evenly into the prepared pan if you are baking the brownies. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the center is just set and feels firm when touched. Cool completely before attempting to cut, these are very rich and gooey! Dust with powdered sugar and cut into squares.) Drop rounded spoonfuls of the brownie mixture into the preheated waffle iron. Close the iron and cook for about 2 minutes until the brownies are done. Remove and cool on a rack. Dust with powdered sugar before serving, if desired. Yield: about 2 dozen hearts or 2-1/2-inch waffle-iron cookies Note: To make pizelle in the shape of cups, drape the warm, still flexible cookie over the bottom of a small juice glass; cool. Fill with ice cream, sherbet or berries and cream to serve. Mail Order Source: electric Krumkake, Pizelle and Heart Shaped Waffle irons Sweet Celebrations, Inc. P.O.

      <li>From: "PK Placko" &lt;pkp@epix.net&gt; This is the most delicious (and easiest!) chocolate cake -- that I have been making for decades. Its only sin was oil which has been replaced successfully with applesauce. Sift dry ingredients into a large bowl. Add liquids, covering with water. Mix thoroughly, and pour into 8 inch square pan sprayed with Pam. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes. Frost with your favorite white frosting.** NOTE: If you aren't fussy, you can make this as a "snack cake", mixing, baking and serving from the same pan. No need to spray with Pam. **My mother always used the traditional butter cream frosting on this cake. Anyone have an outstanding white frosting recipe?

      <li>Beat together sugar and butter until creamy. Beat eggs with vanilla and stir into butter mixture. Sift together dry ingredients and stir into creamed mixture. Batter will be quite stiff. Drop a heaping teaspoonful of batter into each section of a hot waffle iron. Close lid and bake one to 1 1/2 minutes. Do not allow cookies to cook until crisp. Cookies will burn if not removed promptly. Use fork to remove cookies and place on racks to cool. Immediately close lid of waffle iron to reheat, one to two minutes. Meanwhile frost just baked cookie while warm, using recipe below or your favourite frosting. Re-open waffle iron and repeat procedure. Continue until all batter is used. Cookies will have ragged edges characteristic of the waffle iron. Blend together, 1 cup confectioner's sugar, one tablespoon butter, one teaspoon vanilla, two tablespoons cocoa and enough cream or milk to make a smooth, spreadable frosting.

Some people smash some beans on the side of the pot to thicken gravy. Remove bay leaf and serve over cooked rice. Pass the Tabasco for those who like some more spice. Some people like to pour a little Hot Pepper Vinegar on top. We have baked or fried pork chops on the side. MM Waldine Van Geffen vghc42a@prodigy.com.

      <li>3 tablespoons Instant mashed potato flakes mixed with:</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Frozen apple juice</li>
      <li>1 cup Unbleached flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a recipe I got from the FatFree archives (http://www.fatfree.com) and have used several times to rave reviews. After trying several different lowfat pie crusts, this is the one I am going to stick with for fruit pies. It comes out light and springy. A few of my notes follow the recipe. &gt;From Nov.'94 _Vegetarian Times_, "Full of Flavor, Low in Fat Pies," recipes by Bryanna Clark Grogan and Jane Weston Wilson. Pastry for "free form pies" (you wrap the big piece of pastry up over the top) Mix together soymilk, potatoes, syrup or honey, and yeast in a medium bowl or a food processor bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Add salt and flours. If using a food processor, process 30 seconds. Otherwise, mix and knead mixture on a lightly floured surface 5 minutes. (It says here to place in oiled bowl and oil top lightly, but I think we can figure out alternatives.) Cover and let rise until doubled, about an hour. Dough can also be allowed to rise in the 'fridge 2-24 hours. kwvegan vegan 1. I usually have to add a bit of flour to it because it seems to be a bit too sticky to roll out easily. 2. I used non-fat milk instead of the soymilk without a problem. 3. I have used regular flour instead of the wheat and unbleached flour and it works just fine. 4. I haven't bothered to oil the bowl. Since the dough is sticky anyway, I just peel it off the bowl and sprinkle it with flour when I shape it. 5. The dough rises a bit when it bakes. I spread it too thin on the bottom once and the top ended up twice as thick, so make sure you don't skimp on the bottom crust, since it is weighted down with the filling. 6. Cover the top loosely with a piece of foil while baking. I would advise you to spray the foil lightly with an oil spray so it doesn't stick (yes, I made that mistake, too). During the last 10-15 minutes of baking, remove the foil to brown the crust. It browns very quickly, so keep an eye on it and cover it again if it begins to darken too fast.

Mix next three ingredients together and add to pan. Pour 2 cups water into pan and stir until well blended. Bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes. To prepare frosting: combine chocolate, l/2 cup water, butter and 2-1/2 cups marshmallows. Stir over low heat until well blended. Cool slightly. Add sugar gradually and beat with wooden spoon until smooth. Add remaining marshmallows, nuts and vanilla. Frost cake right in the pan.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>With a Julia Child-autographed stabbing knife, pierce the lamb in several places and insert garlic slices and mint (or rosemary). Gloop together the oil, vinegar, Worcestershire, paprika, salt, pepper and sugar. Add enough flour to thicken this muck into a paste. Rub it all over the meat to coat. Then roll the lamb in flour and plunk it in a pan. Shove the pan into a 500-degree oven until the crust has hardened and browned lightly. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake the lamb until done to your liking (somewhere around 30 minutes a pound). Boy, that's going to be good. But if anybody reaches for seconds, hit them on the fist with the spatula. You want to save some leftovers to serve with this: Sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, mustard, curry and paprika and stir-cook a few minutes. Add the broth and heat, stirring until it is smooth and has thickened. Gloop in the sherry. Serve over rewarmed slices of lamb.

      <li>2 tablespoons Peppercorns, whole</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Allspice, whole</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Pineapple juice</li>
      <li>10 Flowers, see note</li>
      <li>10 Lemon slices</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel ginger and slice thinly. In a 1-quart saucepan, combine brown sugar, ginger, peppercorns, allspice, cinnamon sticks and water. Bring to boil; then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Strain, discarding spices; chill. If made ahead, set aside until ready to use. To prepare punch for serving place ice block (should be 2 quarts) in punch bowl. Add chilled syrup, rum, vodka, orange juice and pineapple juice. Taste and add more juices, if desired. Poke stem of each flower through the center of a lemon slice; float slices atop punch. Serve each drink over ice cubes. A few notes: I find this recipe a little sweet, so I add the juice of a lemon or two before serving. The flowers that the recipe suggests are daisies or hibiscus. It then suggests "other flowers" but this is something to be really careful about, since the first time I served this punch some idiot decided to try the flowers! (takes all kinds). This is a really good for a hot summer night (yes we do get them in Canada) - very potent punch.

    <title>Waffle Cone</title>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <category>Usenet</category>
    <quantity>20</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar, granulated</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Beat the eggs and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is creamy. Stir in the melted butter and vanilla. Combine the flour and baking powder, and then add it to the mixture. Blend it in well. Drop about 4 t of the batter into a heated pizelle iron, and cook both sides over medium-high heat for about 1 minute each, or until golden brown. Remove the waffle from the pizelle iron and immediately shape it into a cone while it is still pliable. NOTES: * Waffle ice-cream cone, pizelles -- This recipe comes from a recent issue of _Canadian Living_ magazine. Waffle cones look like round waffles shaped into a cone and have a wonderful taste. (I admit it, I'm hooked on them.) This recipe is actually for a type of cookie called the pizelle, but it tastes just like the waffle cones you can get at an ice-cream parlor. Yield: about 20 cones. * A pizelle iron looks like a round waffle iron. There are "manual" irons and electric ones too. If you don't have a pizelle iron, another idea is to use an ordinary waffle iron and have ice-cream on top of the waffle. Not having either a waffle iron or a pizelle iron, we tried making these on an electric griddle, but since the batter is fairly thick it wouldn't spread into a large enough circle to make cones from. * When you form the cones, there will probably be a small hole in the bottom of them that ice-cream can drip out of. One idea for plugging this hole is to put miniature marshmallows in the bottoms of the cones. : Difficulty: easy to moderate. : Time: 5 minutes preparation, 1-2 minutes (per cone) cooking. : Precision: approximate measurement OK.

      <li>1 tablespoon Miso (up to 2)</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Source: Eat More, Weigh Less Cookbook by Terry Shintani pg. 179 - 1995 edition Note: The recipe didn't specify which kind of miso. It seems it would be dark miso for this recipe. Wakame is a tender Japanese seaweed. All ingredients can be found at an Asian market if you are unable to locate them. Soak wakame and mushrooms in 1 cup of water until soft and cut into 1" pieces. Saute onions in 1/4 cup of water. Add water from the soaked wakame and mushrooms and the rest of the water. Bring to a boil, add the wakame and mushrooms and cook over low flame until it is tender. Add miso to taste by diluting 1 to 2 TB of miso in a ladle full of the soup water, mashing and smoothing out the miso and adding it back to the pot. Leftover grain or noodles may be added if desired. Add other vegetables if desired. Makes 6 portions. 1 portion: Cal 23, Fat .3, Protein 16%, Carbo 73%, CFF 12%.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Waffles are as American as apple pie, and like apple pie are an import. The word "waffle" and probably the food, comes to us from the Dutch "wafel", but the French eat them too, calling them "gaufre" from the Old French "wafla". Whatever their provenance, waffles have been eaten by Americans since Pilgrim times. Europeans eat their waffles as a sweet course, topping them with powdered sugar, whipped cream, or honey or stuffing them with icing. Americans have occasionally served waffles for dessert - perhaps a chocolate waffle with ice cream - but in general we eat them for breakfast with all-American maple syrup. At least NOW we do, if we eat waffles at all. But in the Thirties, and before that, Americans ate waffles with virtually anything that could be spooned or poured over their bumpy, golden tops. And we ate them for breakfast, for luncheon, and for supper. If we served them to guests at a Sunday Night Supper, it became a waffle supper, "sure to be a party guests remember," according to the General Foods cookbook "All About Home Baking" (1933). And we made waffles with just about everything: Cheese waffles; cornmeal waffles; coconut, pineapple, and chocolate waffles; gingerbread waffles; banana waffles; cheese and tomato, date, and peanut butter waffles; apple waffles; oatmeal waffles; and prune, bran, apricot, and even pea pulp waffles (which Pictorial Review featured as one of their best recipes for 1927.)

    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel the sweet potato. Adjust the fluted blade of a mandoline to 1/4-inch and with the mandoline slice the sweet potato, turning it a quarter turn after each slice to produce a waffle pattern (If you don't have a mandoline, just slice the sweet potato crosswise, about 1/8-inch in thickness.) In a deep skillet heat 1-inch of the oil over moderately high heat to 375 degrees F. on a deep-fat thermometer, in it fry the slices in batches, turning them, for 1 minute, or until they are golden, and transfer the chips as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. The chips may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container. Just before serving arrange the chips in one layer in shallow baking pans and heat them in a preheated 400 degrees F. oven for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the chips with salt to taste and serve them warm.

      <li>From: esined@inforail.MV.COM (Denise Gaunt) Date: Wed, 6 Sep 1995 14:25:17 GMT Although the flavors differ, rum can be used in place of vodka for the mixed berry granita. Vodka Berries: Rinse berries and drain well. Layer strawberries and raspberries in a 2-quart glass jar. Top with orange slices and blackberries. Pour vodka over berries until fruit is covered, then cover the jar. Save the empty vodka bottle. Let berries macerate in vodka for three to six days. Strain the berries from the vodka, then pour vodka back into the saved bottle. For the granita: Puree berries and strain through a fine mesh strainer. Pour strained berry juice into large measuring cup. Measure the juice, then add an equal amount of water. Pour into bowl. Whisk in sugar to taste, at least 1+1/4 cup, and stir until dissolved. Pour into a baking pan measuring 9 by 13 by 2 inches and place in freezer until ice crystals form, about 30 minutes. Use a fork to break up frozen crystals. Continue freezing and stirring every 30 to 45 minutes until mixture is completely frozen and ice crystals are uniform in size. Scoop crystals into goblet and garnish with mint or extra berries. Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS BERRIES TAKE 3-6 DAYS! From rec.food.cooking archives. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

Melt butter in a saute pan, and add vodka. Heat to bubbling, about 2 minutes. Add red pepper, tomatoes, salt and heat through. Add cream and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Add cooked pasta to the pan and toss over low heat. Serve immediately. Serves 4. Posted to Kitmailbox Digest by CHICAGOAAA@aol.com on Mar 12, 1997</li>

      <li>FILLING; In food processor, combine walnuts, pistachios, candied peel, sugar, orange blossom water, cinnamon and cloves; process until finely chopped. Place one sheet of phyllo on work surface, covering remaining phyllo with damp tea towel to prevent drying out. Brush sheet with some of the butter. Top with another sheet of phyllo; brush with butter. Repeat with 2 more sheet of phyllo and butter. Sprinkle with about 1/3 cup of the nut mixture. Top with 3 more sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter; sprinkle with 1/3 cup of the nut mixture. Repeat with 3 more sheets, then nuts to make a total of 9 sheets of phyllo. Brush the long edges of dough with butter. Starting at long side, tightly roll up jelly-roll fashion. Brush all over with butter; trim edges. Cut into 3/4 inch thick slices; place on greased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling to make second roll. Bake in 350 oven for 18 to 20 minuts or until crisp and golden, turning over halfway through. Let cool for 5 minutes on baking sheets. Remove to racks set on baking sheets. SYRUP: Meanwhile, using vegetable peeler, peel lemon into thick strips. In saucepan, combie sugar, water and lemon rind; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or until syrupy; strain. Spoon half of the hot syrup over phyllo rounds; let stand for 15 minutes. Spoon remaining syrup over top; let cool completely. Makes about 42. Origin: Canadian Living Magazine, December 1990 issue.

      <li>Seed and stem bell peppers, cut into pieces and process in a food processor. Do not puree. Seed and stem habaneros leaving as many seeds as you want heat. Process in a food processor as with the bell peppers. Removing the seeds will remove part of the vein, therefore the heat. Use only the small amount if you want a milder jelly. Place sugar in a separate bowl. Place the chiles, bell peppers, vinegar, dry pectin and butter in a large stainless steel pot. Bring this to a rolling boil (one that does not stop when stirred). Stirring constantly. Add sugar immediatly to chile mixture. Return to a rolling boil and boil exactly one minute. Stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off any foam. Immediatly fill jars to 1/8 inch from the top. Cover with flat lids and screw bands tightly. Invert jars for 5 minutes to distribute the chiles. After jars are cool check seal by pressing middle of top with your finger. If the bubble springs up jars are not sealed.

Bake for 10 to 14 minutes or until delicately browned. Makes 3 dozen. Source: Pillsbury Classic #21 Hint: Remove cookies from the baking sheet immediately and cool on a rack. They're very difficult to remove from the pan once they have cooled. Be careful not to overfill the cookies, if the topping runs onto the baking sheet it too is very hard to remove. These cookies are sinfully delicious, so they are worth the effort. I have make them several time and they have become family favorites. Enjoy.

      <li>The article quotes;- "Turkish Jews have inumerable variations of turnovers both as sweets and savories. Here, personal preference indicates whether one should use walnuts or almonds or half of each. The borekas are a popular sweet for Purim and can be prepared in large quantities to be frozen after baking. Let them thaw out for onr hour befor gently warming in the oven." 1. Mix all the pastry ingredients (except for the egg yolk mixed with water) together and prepare the pastry. Knead well for a soft, manageable dough, adding enough flour to produce the proper consistency. Cover and set aside. Mix stuffing ingredients together throroughly. 2. Roll out about 1 heaping tablespoon of the pastry on a lightly floured board to 3 or 4 inches in diameter for each boreka. Put 1 tablespoon of the nut mixture on the bottom half of each pastry round. Fold the top over to shape a half-moon. Press down firmly with thei tines of a fork to seal. Paint the surface of each boreka with the egg yolk and water mixture. 3. Put borekas on an ungreased baking sheet and bake in a 350* F. oven for 1/2 hour, or until lightly brown. Serve at room temperature with tea or coffee. Makes about 20.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Vanilla Ice Cream: ================== Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise into 4 sections and place it in a saucepan with the milk. Brink the milk to a boil and remove from heat. In a stainless bowl, whip the egg yolks and sugar until foamy. Strain the milk into the egg mixture. Place the bowl on a double-boiler and mix with a wooden spatula until the mixture thickens and adheres to the spatula. Remove the bowl from the double-boiler and add heavy cream. Place the mixture in a refrigerator until cold. Pour the mixture into an ice cream freezer and churn for 30 minutes or until stiff. Walnut Pie: =========== In a large bowl, combine the sugar, cooled butter, and salt. Add flour 1 cup at a time and mix. Add 1 egg and mix well but do not overwork. Divide the dough mixture into two portions 2/3 and 1/3 parts of the dough. Let the dough rest in a refrigerator for at least 2 hours, overnight if possible. Roll out the 2/3 portion of dough until it's 13 inches in diameter. Place this layer in a buttered 10-inch pie plate. Leave any excess dough hanging over the edge of the plate. Place this dough in the refrigerator. Roll out the 1/3 portion of dough until it's 11 inches in diameter. Refrigerate on waxed paper. Walnut Filling: =============== In a saucepan over medium heat, boil the heavy cream and sugar until reduced by one-half. Add the walnuts and cook for 5 minutes. Pour the cooked mixture into a bowl and refrigerate. Assembly: ========= Remove the pie plate from the refrigerator and fill it with cooled walnut mixture. Take 1 beaten egg yolk and brush the pie dough around the lip of the plate. Cover the pie with the top dough, press around the edges, and remove any excess dough. Score the dough with a fork in a crisscross pattern, then bake it in a 375 F oven for 30 minutes. Refrigerate until cold and serve topped with ice cream.

      <li>* measure ingredients carefully and mix just enough to moisten. Don't worry if the batter still has a few lumps. Overbeating can make muffins tough. * If you don't have a nonstick muffin pan, a spritz of nonstick cooking spray in the pan or on the papers before filing them will prevent these reduced-fat muffins from sticking after they're baked. Remove the papers while the muffins are still warm. * Muffins are best warm from the oven. Reheat any leftovers briefly in the microwave.

Spread walnut mixture over baked shortbread crust. Bake 17-20 minutes (the top will be quite brown.) Allow cookies to cool 15-20 minutes. Pour on icing and spread thin. If icing forms crust on top before it is used just stir crust into icing and use. Allow cookies to cool before cutting.

      <li>1 cup Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Walnuts, ground</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon, ground</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cream the flour and butter. Mix in the sour cream and the egg yolk. Divide the dough into four parts, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for several hours. Mix together the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon. Roll each dough section on a floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick. Spread about 1/4 of the sugar/walnut/cinnamon mixture over each rolled dough section. Cut the dough into pie-shaped wedges and roll, beginning at the wide end. Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet. Brush with melted butter (about 2 T should be enough). Bake for about 20 minutes at 375 degrees F. If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn brown, the dough will be softer and flakier. If you remove them after they have browned slightly, the dough will be crisper. Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled completely, or else they stick to the cookie sheet. NOTES: * Rolled, walnut-filled cookies -- This recipe has been in the family for a while. These cookies make great Christmas gifts. * During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful. However, now they strike me as a bit sweet. You could probably decrease the amount of brown sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 and make up for the loss in volume by increasing the amount of nuts. : Difficulty: easy to moderate. : Time: Initial preparation: 10 minutes; chilling: at least 2 hours; final preparation: 20 minutes; baking: 20 minutes. : Precision: Measure the dough ingredients. : Aviva Garrett : Santa Cruz, CA : Excelan, Inc., San Jose, California, USA : ucbvax!mtxinu!excelan!aviva : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>* Note: See the "Emeril's Essence Information" recipe which is included in this collection. In a small food processor, pulse the walnuts until finely chopped. Remove from the processor and turn into a mixing bowl. Stir the bread crumbs into the walnut mixture and season the mixture with Emeril's Essence. In another mixing bowl, combine the Goat's cheese, 2 tablespoons shallots, 2 teaspoons garlic and chives together. Mix thoroughly. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Form the mixture into 2-ounce cakes, about 1 1/2 inches thick. Dredge the cakes in the seasoned flour. Dip each cake in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Dredge each cake in the walnut crust, coating each side completely. In a saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the chorizo and render for about 2 minutes. When the oil is hot, add the onions and saute for 1 minute. Stir in the remaining shallots, garlic and the split peas. Saute for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the tomatoes and veal stock. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the mixture for 6 to 8 minutes or until the peas are tender. Reseason if necessary. Stir in the thyme and parsley, right at the end. In a large saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, pan-fry the cakes for about 2 minutes on each side, or until the cakes are crispy. Remove the cakes from the oil and drain on paper-lined plate. Season the cakes with Essence. Spoon the sauce in the center of each plate. Place two cakes in the center of the sauce. Garnish with parsley. This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

Stirring well, add the rice. Allow the mixture to simmer gently, covered, for 1 3/4 hours over a very low flame, until rice is soft. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Remove the vanilla bean. Blending well, stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and the egg yolk. Allow to cool a bit more. Preheat the broiler. Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the whipped cream; pour the mixture into individual crocks or a souffle dish. (Raisins my be placed in the bottom of the dishes, if desired.)

    <category>Cookies</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 3/4 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Ground walnuts</li>
      <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup Sweet butter</li>
      <li>Confectioners sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Legend has it that bakers started making pastry in the form of crescents following the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. Preheat oven to 350ø. In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar and ground walnuts. Make a little well in the flour mixture and add the egg yolks. Cut butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly and shape into a ball. Add flour, if needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl. Cut the ball in 4 parts and shape each part in a roll about inch thick. Cut 1/4-inch pieces and form small crescents in the palm of your hand. Place crescents on a greased baking sheet and bake about 9-10 minutes, until light brown. While still warm, roll the crescents in the confectioners sugar (be careful, they break very easily), then place them on a board to cool. Store in a cookie tin. The flavor actually improves with time. Yield: about 3 dozen. Franziska Mayer, Washington, DC Randy Shearer From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Walnuts</li>
      <li>1 cup Ice water</li>
      <li>Salt for the tops (opt.)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"These crackers capture the essence of walnuts. Rich and meaty, but at the same time light and crisp, they are excellent with a blue cheese spread and a glass of port. 350~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. Mix the flours and salt together in a large bowl or in the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the walnuts and stir until they are evenly distributed throughout. Blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. The dough will be somewhat sticky. Wrap the dough in wax paper or lightly buttered aluminum foil and chill for at least 1/2 hour. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. If desired, sprinkle the tops lightly with salt and roll over the dough with your rolling pin. With a cookie cutter, glass, or juice can, cut the dough into 2-inch rounds. Place them on a lightly greased or parchemnt-lined baking sheet. Prick each round in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Yield: 55-60.

    <title>Walnut Pesto Sauce</title>
    <category>Sauces</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Broken walnuts</li>
      <li>1 large Garlic clove; chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups Packed fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Packed Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Finely chop the walnuts and the garlic in a food processor; add half the basil and the salt; coarsely chop. Add the remaining basil and the parsley. With the food processor running, add the oil in a slow steady stream through the feed tube until mixture is thoroughly blended. Transfer to a bowl; fold in the cheese. Remove 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking liquid before draining the pasta. Toss hot pasta with the sauce and the reserved cooking liquid. Serve at once with additional cheese, if desired. Note: taste and adjust salt and add pepper) I grow basil in a very large pot during the spring and summer and make a lot of batches of pesto (omitting the cheese) and freeze individually in small Dixie cups. After it is frozen, I remove from the cups and wrap in Saran Wrap, then place in a freezer Ziploc. To serve defrost as many "pesto patties" as you need and follow above directions remembering to save the pasta water and add cheese. I also use 4 cloves of garlic in this recipe (we love garlic) and add more salt and pepper.

      <li>TABASCO CLASSIC: Walter McIlhenny was very fond of homemade chili and liked to serve his version to former Marine Corps buddies who visited him on the island. In a 5-quart Dutch oven or heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. In three batches, brown the beef well, removing each batch with a slotted spoon. Set aside. Add the onion and garlic to the pot and cook for 5 minutes, or until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, salt, and Tabasco sauce; cook for 1 minute. Add the water and chilies; bring to a boil. Return the beef to the pot. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, 1-1/2 hours, or until the beef is tender. Serve the chili over rice with onion, cheese and sour cream, if desired.</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Walnuts; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup Water; 105-115 degrees</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Water; 105-115 degrees</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Basic bread sponge</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Walnut oil</li>
      <li>2 3/4 cups All-purpose flour; unbleached</li>
      <li>1/2 cups All-purpose flour; for kneading</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Cornmeal; for sprinkling</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Try using maple syrup instead of honey. Can use olive oil instead of walnut. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the walnuts on a baking sheet, roasting until fragrant and golden brown, about eight minutes. Cool. In a bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Allow to proof for three minutes. Stir the sponge, honey and oil into the water, breaking the sponge up using your hands or a spoon. Add 2 3/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding until the dough gathers into a single mass. Knead, in the bowl, until the dough becomes soft and only slightly sticky, using the additional flour gradually as necessary. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead the nuts into the dough until they are evenly distributed. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place on a flour-dusted kitchen towel. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a draft-free location for two hours. Sprinkle a baking sheet generously with cornmeal. Gently press one of the dough balls down on a lightly floured surface and then reshape into a ball. Do the same with the other risen ball. Place both balls, with the seams on the bottom, on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled, in a draft-free location. This should take 2-3 hours. Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Using a razor blade, make an 'X' in the top of each of the loaves. Pour the boiling water into the baking pan. With a quick jerk, slide the loaves off the sheet and onto the stone. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom. When done, cool on a rack.

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Instant espresso powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Boiling-hot water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Sticks; (1/8 cup) unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>3 large Eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>6 ounces Cream cheese; softened</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Pure maple syrup</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: MERINGUE FROSTING</li>
      <li>2 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>1 cup Pure maple syrup</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cream of tartar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make cake layers: Preheat oven to 350° F. and butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans, knocking out excess flour. On a baking sheet toast walnuts in middle of oven until 1 shade darker, about 8 minutes, and cool. In a food processor grind walnuts fine. Into a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and a pinch salt. In a small cup stir together espresso powder and water. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy and add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in flour mixture, espresso, walnuts, and oil until just combined. Spoon batter into cake pans, smoothing tops, and bake in middle of oven about 25 minutes, or until pale golden and a tester comes out clean. Cool cake layers in pans on a rack 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around edges of pans and invert cake layers onto rack to cool completely. In a small bowl beat together cream cheese and 2 tablespoons maple syrup until smooth. Assemble torte: Arrange 1 cake layer on an ovenproof serving plate and with a pastry brush gently brush top with 1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly onto layer and top with remaining layer. Brush top of torte with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup. Torte may be prepared up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring torte to room temperature before proceeding. Make frosting: Let whites stand at room temperature 1 hour. In a 1-quart heavy saucepan bring maple syrup to a boil over moderate heat and simmer until a candy thermometer registers 235° F. (be careful it doesnÕt bubble over). While maple syrup is simmering, in bowl of a standing electric mixer beat whites with cream of tartar and a pinch salt until they just hold stiff peaks. Add hot maple syrup in a stream, beating until meringue is thickened and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Preheat broiler. Immediately frost torte with a narrow metal spatula, mounding extra meringue on top and drawing it up with a fork to form peaks (see photograph, page 111). Broil torte about 4 inches from heat until tops of peaks are pale golden, about 30 seconds. Let torte stand at room temperature 15 minutes before serving. Makes 1 torte.

Heat the butter or margarine and the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the beef and cook until most of the liquid has been rendered and meat is browned on all sides, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the beef and keep warm. Add the onion and red pepper strips to the skillet and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Return the beef to the skillet and add the blender mixture. Heat to boiling, then reduce the heat and simmer uncovered until the beef is hot and the sauce is slightly thickened. Serve over rice or stuffed into pitas, with rice on the side.

      <li>I've been playing around with these ingredients and my husband thinks I should "go public" with this recipe! It's for a bread machine, but you could make it by hand in the conventional way, too. In my Zojirushi machine the crust is rather dark (but still delicious) so other machines may need a light crust setting. Enjoy! Place ingred. in B/M in order given (start at bottom for&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Welbilt/Dak) set crust to light and bake on white bread setting. I'm munching on the "heel" as I type and am thinking about how good a sandwich will be in a few hours! Maybe next time I'll add pepperoni and have all the sandwich ingredients in each slice. It has a real pizza taste! LINDA IN BIRMINGHAM 08/15 10:15 am Re-Formatted by Elaine Radis; 3/92 Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #410 by serge.cyr@sympatico.ca (Serge Cyr) on Nov 23, 1997</li>

Combine the beef, egg, salt, 3/4 cup of sauce and the chopped onion. Blend well and shape into 6 large meatballs. Cut 6 squares of heavy duty foil, large enough to contain each onion half, and on each of the squares. Put a meatball in each onion half and spoon a little of the sauce over the combination. Fold the foil up around the onions and seal tightly, allowing space in the foil packets for steam. Grill 4 to 6 inches above the hot coals about 30 minutes. Protecting the hands with mitts, peel back the foil so tops of the meat and onions are exposed. Baste with the drippings in the foil packets or with additional sauce. Cover the grill or shape a loose tent of foil over the onions and continue cooking 25 minutes longer or until the onions are as tender as desired and the meat is done to your taste.

    <recipetext>
      <li>This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I substituted oil for the margarine and with some experimentation, came up with this technique: Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan for 3 to 4 more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again with the damp towel and allow to rise for another two hours. At the end of two hours, refrigerate the dough, still covered, for at least 12 hours (the longer the better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!! * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers' directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let me know your results, we sure enjoyed it!

      <li>twelve 7- to 8-inch flour tortillas (recipe follows or store-bought), warmed (procedure follows) guacamole and tomato salsa as accompaniments Make the marinade: In a large bowl whisk together the garlic paste, the lime juice, the cumin, and the oil. Add the steak to the marinade, turning it to coat it well, and let it marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour or overnight. Grill the steak, drained, on a well-oiled rack set about 5 inches over glowing coals or in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until it is just springy to the touch, for medium-rare meat. (Alternatively, the steak may be broiled on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat.) Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it stand for 10 minutes. While the steak is standing, in a large skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the bell peppers, the onion, and the garlic, and sauté the mixture, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the bell peppers are softened. Slice the steak thin across the grain on the diagonal and arrange the slices on a platter with th! ! ! e bell pepper mixture. Drizzle any steak juices over the steak and the pepper mixture and serve the steak and the pepper mixture with the tortillas, the guacamole, and the salsa. To assemble a fajita: Spread some of the guacamole on a tortilla, top it with a few slices of the steak, some of the pepper mixture, and some of the salsa, and roll up the tortilla to enclose the filling. TO WARM TORTILLAS Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. In the oven: Stack 6 tortillas at a time, wrap each stack in foil, and heat the tortillas in the middle of a preheated 325°F. oven for 5 minutes for corn tortillas and 15 minutes for flour tortillas. (If the tortillas are very dry to begin with, pat each tortillas between dampened hands before stacking them.) In the microwave: Stack 6 tortillas at time, wrap each stack in a microwave-safe plastic bag, and heat the tortillas in a microwave oven at high power (100%) for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until they are heated through and pliable. Makes 12 fajitas, serving 6 &gt;From Jane Butel's cooking school in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

      <li>Date: Tue, 27 Feb 96 8:30:00 EST submitted by: johndrew@sn.no Here's a good marinade for especially flank steak on BBQ. You can use it on other beef cuts. This is the marinade and the basting sauce ( while on the grill). SLIGHTLY CUT LINES INTO THE STEAK and then again CROSSWIDTH; DO the same for the other side. Mix the ingredients above and pour over steak in a flat baking dish. Refrigerate over night; at least turn steak over once while marinating. Get the coals the way you want them, pop on the steak, baste with it's marinade; cook it to your liking! If you want, you can still use that sauce poured on your steak for a gravy. I created this marinade and always had praise when company came over for a BBQ and had this recipe .

    <title>Beef in Guiness</title>
    <category>Meats</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds Shin of beef</li>
      <li>2 large Onions</li>
      <li>6 medium Carrots</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Seasoned flour</li>
      <li>Little fat or beef dripping</li>
      <li>1/2 pints 1 cup of Guiness &amp; water</li>
      <li>Mixed</li>
      <li>Sprig of parsley</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The Guiness in this recipe has the same function as the wine in Coq Au Vin - the acid &amp; moisture combined with the long, slow cooking help tenderise the tough but flavoursome meat. Cut the beef into chunks &amp; peel &amp; slice the onions &amp; carrots. Toss the beef in the flour &amp; brown quickly in hot fat. Remove the beef &amp; fry the onions gently until transparent. Return the beef &amp; add the carrots &amp; the liquid. Bring just to the boil, reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer, cover closely &amp; cook &amp; cook for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Check that the dish does not dry out, adding more liquid if necessary. Sprinkle with chopped parsley &amp; serve with plainly boiled potatoes.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut beef into small cubes (1x2 inch) and keep chilled until about 1 hour before cooking. Set electric fondue to 360 degrees and add oil (be careful with hot oil). Each guest is given a plate of raw meat and cooking fork (also a separate eating fork). They spear one piece and cook to individual preference. It takes a little experimentation. Offer a variety of 4 to 6 sauces. Bottled or experiment with your own exciting recipes. Serve with baked potato, vegetables and a green tossed salad. This is a wonderful entertaining meal. Great for conversation and a long evening. NOTE: It is best to have no more than 6 people cooking in one pot for convenience and safety reasons. Also not recommended for children under 8.

      <li>2 tablespoons Brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups To 3 cup dark beer</li>
      <li>(microbrew preferred)</li>
      <li>1 large Herb bouquet *</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Cornstarch - blended with</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Red wine vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Herb bouquet is 6 parsley springs, one bay leave and 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme tied in a cheesecloth. Preheat oven to 325. Add oil to heavy skillet and heat until almost smoking. Brown meat quickly in batches, do not crown the pan. Set meat aside. Reduce heat to medium, add onions (add more oil if necessary)and brown onions lightly for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from pan and set aside. Season with salt and pepper and then stir in garlic. Arrange half of the browned meat in dutch oven and season lightly with salt and pepper. Spread half of the onions over the beef. Repeat with the rest of the beef and onions. Heat the stock in the skillet scrapping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Stir in the brown sugar and pour over the beef/onion mixture. Add enough beer so the meat is barely covered. Bury the herb bouquet in the center of the meat chunks. Bring the mixture to a simmer on top of the stove, cover and place in lower third of the preheated 325 degree oven. Cook at slow simmer for 2 1/2 hours. Remove herb bouquet. Drain liquid into a saucepan and skim off fat. Blend cornstarch mixture into the cooking liquid and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Taste and correct seasoning. There should be about 2 cups of sauce. Pour sauce back over the meat. When ready to serve, cover the casserole and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes until meat is heated through. Serve with new potatoes or noodles garnished with parsley.

      <li>1 tablespoon Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Crushed hot red chiles; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim off all the fat and silverskin from the roast. Cut 1/8-inch the meat into 1/8-inch slices. Separate roast into it's natural sections before slicing results it meat pieces about the right size. Mix the smoke flavoring, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, pepper, and chiles and let stand for 5 minutes. Then place in a bowl with a tight seal big enough for the marinade and cut meat; let stand 10 minutes for flavors to develop. Layer meat in the bowl so that each side gets coated with marinade and cover tightly. Let stand about 10 minutes, shaking bowl and inverting every few minutes to cover all pieces evenly. Longer marinating does not change the flavor. Drain meat in sieve or colander and place in single layers on the dehydrator trays. (Takes about 7 trays for 5 pounds of meat.) Dry according to your dehydrator instructions. Enjoy. NOTES : I prefer top round because of the large clear sections of meat, however, almost any cut will do if you trim the meat well. This marinade also works well with fish and turkey. Recipe by: Jerry Morrow Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #714 by "Jerry Morrow" &lt;j-morrow@msn.com&gt; on Aug 1, 97</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>2 Medium-sized onions</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Lard (actually you can substitute oil or bacon drippings although the lard will keep it authentic)</li>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds Beef chuck or round; cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Red hungarian paprika (yes I did say 2 tablespoons paprika )</li>
      <li>1 medium Sized ripe tomato</li>
      <li>2 Green italian peppers</li>
      <li>1 pound Potatoes</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: LITTLE DUMPLINGS</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vegetable oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1.Peel onions and chop into coarse pieces. Melt the lard in a heavy 6-to-8 quart Dutch oven. Saute the onion in the lard until translucent. Heat should be low in order not to brown the onions. 2.When onions become transluscent add the beef. Stir so that during this part of the process, which should last about 10 minutes, the meat will be sauteed with the onions. 3.Meanwhile chop and crush the garlic with a little salt using the flat side of a heavy knife. 4.Remove the Dutch oven from the heat.Stir in paprika and the garlic. Stir rapidly with a wooden spoon.Immediately after paprika is absorbed, add 21/2 quarts WARM WATER. (cold water toughens the meat if you add it while the meat is frying.) 5.Replace the Dutch oven over low heat and cook for about an hour. 6.While the meat is cooking, peel the tomato, then cut it into 1-inch pieces. Core the green pepper and slice into rings. Peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch dice. 7.After the meat has been cooking for about an hour ( the time depends on the cut of the meat) add the cut-up tomato and green peppers and enough water to give a soup consistency. Add a little salt. Simmer slowly for another 30 minutes. 8.Add the potatoes and cook the goulash till the potatoes are done. Adjust salt. 9.Add the dumplings to the goulash and cook 2 to 3 minutes. 10.Serve the goulash steaming hot in large extra-deep bowls. The meat should be tender, but not falling apart. Serve with lots of italian bread to sop up the fabulous gravy. ( by the way the italian bread is not authentic Hungarian, you would need rye bread for that , but it will do) Makes 8 servings Little Dumplings: Mix the egg with the flour and salt. Spoon the mixture into the boiling goulash, using 1/4 teaspoon at a time. Cook with the goulash for 2 to 3 minutes just before you are ready to serve.

    <title>Beef Jerky</title>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 pounds Very lean beef (such as flank steak) (up to 5)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Black pepper</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Liquid smoke</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The following is a recipe my dad uses. I believe he got if from a newspaper about 25 years or so ago. When it starts drying the whole house smells like beef jerky and you can hardly wait for it to dry, unless of course you use a dehydrator it dries alot faster. Any way IMHO this is the best beef jerky I have ever tasted. slice the beef into strips 1/4 in. thick, 1/2 in. wide and 4-6in. long. It does need thin slices to cure properly. If you freeze the meat unti9l it's ice, it will slice easier and cutting across the grain will give a crisp jerky and cutting with the grain a chewy jerky. Mix remaining ingredients and pour over the strips. marinate overnight in the fridge turning it a couple of times for good saturation. Drain and pat on paper towling. The drying process can be done in one of two ways sun dried or kitchen range dried. Either way it must be dried until quite britlle. Store in covered jars or tightly sealed plastic bags. Like I said this recipe came from quite a few years ago. I suppose if you have a dehydrator and follow the drying instruction it can also be done that way. We always dried ours in the oven. To do this you place the strips over the rack so that they hang down. Leave the oven door slightly open so as not to cook the meat and have the oven on the lowest setting possible. This way takes approximately 24-36 hours to dry. Also a note on cutting the meat. At the grocery store where I shop if you give the meat you want to the butcher and tell him it's for beef jerky he will slice it for you. I don't know if all places are like that but it's alot easier than slicing it yourself. Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #211 by LTQV92A@prodigy.com (MR MATTHEW E KOTARSKI) on Aug 31, 1997</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Servings: 12 Trim all visible fat from the meat and freeze until firm and solid enough to slice into thin strips. Cut across the grain and make sure that the slices are as thin as you can make them, about 1/8 inch thick. Cut slices into 1-inch- wide strips. Arrange strips in a shallow baking pan. Combine remaining ingredients and pour liquid over strips. Refrigerate overnight or for at least 8 hours. Preheat oven to 140 degrees. Remove meat from the marinade and place the strips on a cake rack over a cookie sheet in the oven. Dry until strips will splinter on the edges--from 18-24 hours. Cool completely before wrapping lightly with plastic wrap. Jerky will keep in a closely covered container for 2 4 weeks. OR...use your dehydrator according to manufacturer's recommendations.

      <li>Ingredient Group: MEAT MARINADE</li>
      <li>Olive or other vegetable oil</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>First, marinate the skirt steaks in the oil/lime juice mixture as described above. Overnight in the refrigerator works well using a ziploc bag. The amount of marinade depends on the amount of meat. [The lime juice imparts an incredibly sweet and fresh taste to the meat; you will love the effect.] Prepare your accompaniments and have them ready for guests to use according to their own preferences. Some people fry onions (instead of using them raw) and others cook some green pepper as accompaniments. I personally think that this detracts from a simple fresh taste, but hey this is food, not medicine... Grill the fajitas outside (over wood charcoal if you can get it)-- over a medium hot fire this will require about 10 minutes a side. After grilling, allow the skirt steaks to sit for a couple of minutes, then slice across the grain in relatively thin slices. Warm the flour torillas slightly (microwave will do nicely if you aren't a purist). Allow people to assemble the fajitas themselves: slices of meat rolled in the torillas together with accompaniments of their choice. You may also want to have some hot pepper sauce and cilantro also at the ready. This is a "can't lose" company dish; the meat when re-heated tastes good as left-overs as well. NOTE: Beef skirt steaks (you may have to ask the butcher for these outside the Southwest; they are inexpensive and readily available in the prime fajita areas of the country such as Texas) [Note that you can use flank steak if forced to but it just doesn't taste the same.] Michael Karchmer MAKARCHMER@gallua.gallaudet.EDU AT986@FREENET.CARLETON.CA (WARD TOMLINSON) REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <quantity>20</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 pounds Rump roast (or similar cut)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Light Japanese soy sauce; I use Kikkomon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Worchestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cups White vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground red pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Onion powder</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic; smashed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>have the butcher cut your roast in 1/8 inch slice against the grain. OR do it at home. if you don't have good cutlery, have the butcher do it. it won't be worth it! cut off the slice of fat on the bottom. separate the two distinct sinews. (you can tell, the grain goes one way on one, and the other way on the other). Trim out the "gristle" that is between them. slice the two sinews against the grain into 1/8 inch slices. Mix the soya, and remaining ingredients to make the marinade. Marinade the meat slices for 6 or 8 hours in the fridge. (I usually place in a ziploc type bag, and place in a bowl--turning a couple of times to be sure all the slices get an equal chance at the marinade) Note: I use the smoke very spareingly, I've used as much as a 1/4 teas. (10 drops) in this recipe. Any more is too much IMHO. But you might use more if you really like smoke, but a little goes a long way. I prefer Japanese soya, cuz it's lighter than the Chinese soya. And I get the Light Japanese soya, which has significantly less salt. You could add more red pepper if you like it spicey or use fresh ginger instead of bottled. If you like it sweeter, replace the water with a cup of Vermont maple syrup. Also when choosing your roast, the leaner, the better.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim off all the fat and silverskin from the roast. Cut 1/8-inch the meat into 1/8-inch slices. Separate roast into it's natural sections before slicing results it meat pieces about the right size. Mix the smoke flavoring, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, pepper, and chiles and let stand for 5 minutes. Then place in a bowl with a tight seal big enough for the marinade and cut meat; let stand 10 minutes for flavors to develop. Layer meat in the bowl so that each side gets coated with marinade and cover tightly. Let stand about 10 minutes, shaking bowl and inverting every few minutes to cover all pieces evenly. Longer marinating does not change the flavor. Drain meat in sieve or colander and place in single layers on the dehydrator trays. (Takes about 7 trays for 5 pounds of meat.) Dry according to your dehydrator instructions. Enjoy. NOTES : I prefer top round because of the large clear sections of meat, however, almost any cut will do if you trim the meat well. This marinade also works well with fish and turkey. Recipe by: Jerry Morrow Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 215 by "Laura J.Bettingen" &lt;labette@sprynet.com&gt; on Nov 7, 1997</li>

      <li>1 cup Red wine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Salt and pepper the fish and dredge in flour. Shake off excess. In a heavy saucepan saute the onion in 2 Tbs. olive oil. When translucent, add the garlic and slowly saute another minute. Stir in 2 tablespoons flour, blend well, and cook, stirring for a minute or two. Off heat pour in the wine and boiling water; whisk thoroughly. Return to heat, whisking as the sauce thickens. Add bay leaves, thyme, and tomato puree. Let simmer while you sear the fish. In a pan large enough to hold the 4 walleyes in one layer, heat the remaining oil and when hot, but nor smoking, sear the fish quickly on each side. Now, pour the red wine sauce over the fish. Bring to a boil, then quickly lower the heat. Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Just before serving remove the bay leaves, adjust the seasoning (the sauce will probably need salt and pepper), toss the capers in, and sprinkle with chopped parsley on top.

    <recipetext>
      <li>(from Paula Wolfert's Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean) In a food processor, grind walnuts with salt and paprika. After walnuts exude their oil and the mixture is pasty, blend in just enough warm water to make walnuts turn creamy and light-colored. Scrape into small bowl. Crush garlic with a pinch of salt. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cilantro and cook, stirring, until oil just begins to sizzle (maybe 2 - 3 minutes). Add to the walnuts along with the lemon juice and enough of the water to give the sauce an even consistency. Correct the seasoning. Makes one cup. If you use this for fish, brush fillets with olive oil and bake on an oiled baking sheet until just cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer fish to a shallow serving dish. Spread an even layer of sauce over each fillet and garnish with lemon. Serve at room temperature. Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by pamra@rockland.net (Alexandra Soltow) on May 11, 1998</li>

    <title>Walker's Red Hot Chile Con Carne (1918)</title>

    <category>Chili</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Beef; cut in small pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Beef suet; ground fine or lard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Walker's Mexene</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion; minced</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In 1918, Walker Austex was producing 45,000 cans of Walker's Red Hot Chile Con Carne (with beans) and 15,000 cans of Mexene Chili Powder a day in their new factory in Austin, Texas. But Walker had already been selling canned Mexican foods for over a quarter century and may have been the first to can chili. Gebhardt's didn't start canning chili (as opposed to making chili powder) until 1911. Walker's 1918 recipe booklet had recipes for "chile huevos" and "chili mac" -- plus something called "combination chili con carne" -- one can chili mixed with one can tomatoes. Genuine Mexican Chile Con Carne. One pound of beef cut in small pieces; 1/4 lb. beef suet, ground fine (or you can use lard). Add two tablespoons of Walker's Mexene, one medium sized onion minced; add water and boil until thoroughly cooked. The gravy from this chili con carne is fine for macaroni, spaghetti and vegetables. If beans are wanted, use any good red bean. For instance -- California Bayous, California Pinks or Pinto Beans. When these are not convenient, use French Red Kidney Beans. Boil the beans separately and add beans when serving.

      <li>For the Cambridge sauce:</li>
      <li>1 Hard cooked egg</li>
      <li>1 can Rinsed and chopped anchovy fillets</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Crushed capers</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Chopped chervil</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the fish fillets in the egg and buttermilk mixture. Now, the Cambridge sauce. In a small bowl combine egg, anchovy fillets, capers, chopped herbs, Dijon mustard, vinegar, cayenne, and salt and pepper. Stir and mash together thoroughly. Then gradually add the oil and incorporate completely. You should end up with a mayonnaise type consistency. Place vegetable oil in a deep saute pan to come no more than 1/3 up the side of the pan. Heat until a deep fat fry thermometer registers 350 degrees. Meanwhile, in a shallow bowl combine the flour and cornmeal, and season with the Creole spice. Coat the fish fillets with the flour mixture. Carefully drop the fish fillets into the saute pan and fry until golden, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the bread slices with a generous coating of the Cambridge sauce. Remove the fish from the pan and drain on paper towels. Place each piece on a slice of bread and top with another slice. Garnish with the pickles.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>by Susan Fowler Volland, Food Stylist and Food Editor Whole, crispy fried Walla Walla Sweet Onions cut to resemble flowers are a popular treat at fairs and festivals throughout Washington State. The "petals" of the onion are simply torn off and dipped in zesty barbecue sauce. Try this simple, reduced-fat version which can easily be made in the oven. The lovely presentation and combination of flavors make a memorable plate, especially when paired with good company and a tall, cool lemonade. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Lightly grease a large baking or roasting pan. Peel the Walla Walla Sweet Onions, cut the bottom level, but leave the core intact. To make the flower design, begin as if you are going to cut the onion in half, from top to bottom, but stop cutting 1/2 inch from the core. Cut the onion this way 5 times to form ten sections or "petals." Carefully loosen the petals slightly by rapping the onion lightly on the work surface, and loosening them with your fingers. Remember that the flower will bloom more as it cooks. Place the flour, salt, pepper, oregano, paprika and mustard in a small paper bag. Spray the onions with cooking spray to lightly coat each petal. Put one of the onions in the bag and gently shake to coat. Remove the onion and pat off the excess flour mixture. Place in a prepared pan and repeat with the other onion. Spray the coated onions lightly again with cooking spray to aid in browning. Bake the onions in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until tender. Serve the onion flowers hot, with your favorite barbecue sauce as a dip. Serves: 4 Posted to EAT-LF Digest by "Brownlee, Shari" &lt;BrownleeS@dsmo.com&gt; on May 15, 1998</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Butter a 9" square pan. Melt butter in 2 quart saucepan; gradually stir in sugar. Add syrup and water. Cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture reaches 290° on a candy thermometer. Add 1 cup walnuts, and cook 3 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Pour into pan. When it is set, but not cool, crumble 2 Hershey bars on top and spread them to cover. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup finely chopped nuts. Turn onto waxed paper and repeat procedure with remaining 2 Hershey bars and 1/4 cup nuts. When cold, break into small pieces. If toffee gets too cold to melt Hersheys, melt them over warm water, but it works best if chocolate is melted right on toffee.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Combine apples with 2 cups water and lemon juice. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, sift together granulated and brown sugars, 3 cups sifted flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Add vanilla, oil and eggs; mix well. Spoon soaked apples into batter, so that some of the soaking liquid is included for moistness. Fold in nuts. Bake on low oven rack for 1 hour, 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool cake in pan 10 minutes, then turn out onto cake rack. When cake has cooled, prepare glaze: In a small saucepan with heavy bottom, combine butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and cream. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool 5 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Pour glaze over cake. Garnish as desired with nut halves. Yield: 12 to 16 servings. Recipe from: Dotty Griffith, who writes for The Dallas Morning News.

      <li>1 cup Maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Line an 8x8x2-inch baking pan with foil, extending foil over edges of pan. Spray with with vegetable oil. Sprinkle chopped walnuts on the bottom of the foil-lined pan; set pan aside. 2. In a heavy 3-quart saucepan melt the butter over low heat. Add the sugar cream maple syrup and mix well. Cook over medium-high heat to boiling, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to dissolve sugar. This should take 6 to 8 minutes. Avoid splashing the mixture on sides of pan. Carefully clip candy thermometer to side of pan. 3. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, till candy thermometer registers 248F, firm-ball stage. Mixture should boil at moderate, steady rate over entire surfacce. Reaching firm-ball stage should take 45 to 55 minutes. 4. Remove saucepan from heat; remove candy thermometer from sauccepan. Immediately stir in vanilla. Quickly pour the caramel mixture over the nuts in the prepared pan. 5. Cool. When caramel is firm, use foil to lift it out of pan. Use a knife to cut candy into 1-inch squares. Wrap each piece in cleaar plastic wrap. Makes 64 pieces or about 2 pounds. Note: I did not wrap them but put them in small bags (10 per bag) and store them in the freezer that's how I like them cold and hard. Warning they are very rich. Enjoy and happy holidays.

      <li>In a large pot, cook flour in the oil, stirring until browned. Do not burn. Add veggies and saute until transparent. Throw in carcass, bones, left-over morsels of turkey, sausage, gravy, neck and giblets (I use these in my gravy and remove them to save for the gumbo), herbs, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until all meat falls off the bones. Cool. Pick bones out of gumbo. Let sit in the fridge and skim off excess fat. Add fresh parsley This is my favorite leftover from Thanksgiving. NOTE-I have since changed this recipe to avoid using all the oil. I saute the veggies in a little broth until tender. Then add the carcass, etc. When cooked, thicken with Instant flour or a mixture of cornstarch/water. Serve over rice and pass the file' MM Waldine Van Geffen vghc42a@prodigy.com.

    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Warm beer</li>
      <li>2 packages Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups Unbleached all-purpose flour or as needed</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Rye flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Walnut oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Finely chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Coarsely chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ;Water</li>
      <li>Fresh or dried rosemary</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the beer to 105 to 115 F. and pour 1/2 cup into a small bowl. Stir in the yeast and let stand 10 minutes. Mix the flours, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Pour the yeast mixture, oil and remaining 1 cup beer into the well and stir until blended. Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, adding more flour if necessary. Coat a large bowl with walnut oil. Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. (You can also let the dough rise overnight in a cool place or in the refrigerator.) Punch dough down and knead in the onion and walnuts until evenly distributed throughout the dough. Divide dough in half. Divide each half into thirds. Using your hands, roll each of the pieces into 12" long ropes. Braid 3 ropes together to form a loaf. Tuck the ends under and place on an 18 x 12" baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, placing it on the same baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Beat the egg and 2 tsp. water in a small bowl. Brush the tops of the loaves with the egg wash and sprinkle with rosemary. Bake at 375 F. until crusty and brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Turn out onto wire racks and cool completely. The authors write: "A hearty and rustic bread that makes an excellent picnic lunch with cheese, especially goat's milk cheese. Take your favorite full-bodied red wine along."

    <category>Meat</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Pork steak; deboned &amp; cut into 1/8-inch strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Light soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dry sherry</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Fresh grated ginger</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Peanut oil</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic; peeled &amp; sliced paper thin</li>
      <li>1 large Yellow onion; sliced</li>
      <li>3 Golden Delicious apples; cored and sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Fresh ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 Green onions; chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>SERVES 6 Have you thought about garlic with apples? Well, the two belong together, absolutely belong together. This is a quick dish that is not terribly sweet, as you would expect, but very flavorful. Cut the pork steak as instructed and marinate for 15 minutes in the soy, sherry, and ginger. Heat a wok or large frying pan and add the oil and garlic. Drain the marinade from the meat and saut‚ the meat over very high heat until done to your liking, about 6 minutes. Remove the meat from the pan and add the onion slices. Saut‚ until tender and then add the apple slices. Saut‚ just until they begin to brown. Return the meat to the pan, add the sesame oil and pepper, and toss. Top with the green onions as a garnish. Serve immediately. This is a whole meal if you simply add Macaroni Pie (see recipe) and a green salad. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

Add the remaining apple slices to the pitcher on top of the ice... assemble the machine and the pitcher and turn it on... 4) add the apple slices from the steeping pot to the pitcher when the tea is done along with more ice to fill the pitcher... stir vigorously and serve...

Lightly grease sides of 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Prepare Streusel Topping: In medium bowl, mix flour, pecans, brown sugar, slightly softened butter, vanilla and cinnamon until mixture comes together. Shape into a ball. Prepare crust: Into large bowl, measure flour, sugar and salt. Cut in 1/2 cup cold butter into small bits. With fingertips, blend butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press evenly into bottom of baking pan. Bake crust 15 to 20 minutes our until golden. Crust may crack slightly but don't worry. Place apple slices in 10-inch skillet. Add raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon and 3 tablespoons butter. Cook 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender. In cup, mix cornstarch and lemon juice. Stir lemon juice mixture into apple slice mixture and cook until thickened. This should happen quickly. Remove from heat. Spoon apple mixture over crust. Break Streusel Topping into chunks and scatter over apple mixture. Bake 30 minutes or until streusel is browned. Cook completely, in pan, placed on wire rack. When cold cut into 16 pieces and serve. Serves 16. 284 calories per bar, according to MasterCook.

      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter or margarine</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Put all in a large pot and simmer, stirring often. Check to maintain liquid level the first 10 minutes, and add water, if necessary, only to avoid scorching. Apples will start to add juice until, when they are cooked and mushy (about 20 minutes for a large pot). liquid will have reached top of apples. Sieve (old-fashioned type with a crank-type handle) in batches, and serve immediately (hot). My fiance was resistant to trying apple sauce with cinnamon, and had never had it hot, but when he had a taste, he went back for seconds and thirds! A word about the apples. I prefer Granny Smiths. These are tart, crisp, green apples that hold up well with cooking. My second favorite is McIntosh. Bought in large bags or bulk, this can be a very reasonable treat this time of year in northeast USA.

      <li>1/4 cups Butter</li>
      <li>2 cups Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>Grated peel of 1/2 a lemon</li>
      <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>2 Egg whites</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pare, core and slice apples. Melt butter in a deep, 9" round cake pan, add brown sugar and stir until well mixed. Top with apples and sprinkle with lemon juice and peel. Beat egg yolks and sugar until light and pale yellow. Mix water and vanilla. Stir flour with salt and baking powder and add to egg mixture alternately with vanilla mixture. Beat egg whites until stiff, fold into batter and pour over apples. Bake at 350 degree F oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Serve hot or tepid, and it is best not to unmold the pudding. NOTES : This pudding is more of a sponge cake over an upside down mixture. An Alberta Mennonite sent me the recipe and said it was three generations old. Baking powder is a modern change, and the lemon peel is my addition.

      <li>This recipe is my Mammaw's as described by my cousin Ethel Tackett to the Alleghany Freewill Baptist Auxiliary in Alleghany, Kentucky. It is a little different than I originally remembered but as I read the recipe the flavors all came back to me. Hope you enjoy! Cream together sugar, molasses and Crisco. Add Eggs and mix well. Add bittermilk and mix. Add soda and ginger to flour; by hand, blend flour into creamed mixture. Pour 1/2 cup of mixture into greased pans. Bake at 400 until until done. Makes 6 - 8 layers, if using 8-inch pans. Cook apples, sugar and spices together. Stack cake together using apples between each layer. NOTE: I remember Mammaw using dried apples rather than fresh. Obviously my cousin has updated this a touch. Posted to EAT-L Digest by "June A. Halapir" &lt;ad6097@WAYNE.EDU&gt; on Feb 9, 1998</li>

      <li>1 cup Sifted confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Skim milk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375F. Spray two 8 or 9 inch round pans with cooking spray. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 c. all-purpose flour and the yeast. In a small saucepan combine 3/4 c. Natural Apple Sauce, skim milk, 2 tbsp. sugar, butter, and salt. Heat over medium heat and stir just until warm (120F. to 130 F) and butter is almost melted (milk will appear curdled). Add to flour mixture along with egg. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes, using a spoon to stir in 2-1/4 c. flour. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour, up to 1/4 c. to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 min.). Shape dough into a ball. Place dough in a bowl sprayed lightly with cooking spray; turn dough once to grease surface. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (about 1 hr.). Punch dough down, turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. On lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch square. Spread 1/4 c. Natural Apple Sauce. Combine 1/3 c. sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough. Roll up and seal seams. Slice dough into 12 pieces. Arrange 6 rolls, cut side down, in each pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled (about 30 min.). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden. Cool 5 min. Invert onto serving plate. Drizzle with a mixture of confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and skim milk. Serve warm Notes: Pantry: Mott's Natural Apple Sauce. (PER SERVING: 260 calories, 2.9 grams of fat.

      <li>Process on "dough" cycle. The filling would be 1/2 cup melted margarine or butter (I use 1/4 cup) topped with 1 cup brown sugar mixed with 3 TBS cinnamon. (I add raisins and nuts.) The topping is 4 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter or margarine (I skip this) 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar and a teaspoon or two of milk. I've done these both "full fat" and "reduced fat." It's hard to tell the difference, so we go "reduced," including using light (Neufchatel) cream cheese. I've tried ALL the fat free cream cheeses and NONE of them work. JUDITH PENZINER (GGMB18A)JUDITH PENZINER (GGMB18A) Happy baking!

      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>1 pound Golden Delicious apples; peeled, cored and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground allspice</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CAKE</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsalted butter; room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Molasses or sorghum syrup</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Eggs; room temperature</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lowfat buttermilk; room temperature</li>
      <li>6 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the filling, in a nonreactive medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sliced apples and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the apples are soft and the water has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat. Mash the apples with the back of a fork and fold in the sugar, cinnamon and allspice. Return the pan to medium-low heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is thick, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. To make the cake, in a large bowl, combine the butter, molasses or sorghum, sugar and eggs. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the buttermilk and blend well. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Using a wooden spoon, fold the flour mixture into the creamed mixture until well blended. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide dough into 10 equal portions. Using the outline of an 8-inch round baking pan, draw a circle on waxed paper. Roll out 1 portion of the dough to fit the circle, then slide the dough circle and waxed paper onto a baking sheet and bake on the middle oven rack until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Slide the round off the baking sheet onto a wire rack to cool, removing the waxed paper while still warm. Repeat with the remaining dough for a total of 10 baked rounds. To assemble the cake, place 1 cooled round layer onto a serving plate and spread with 1 to 2 tablespoons of cooked apple filling. Top with another cake layer, spread with filling and repeat, alternating cake layers with filling and ending with cake. Do not spread filling over the top cake layer. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to two days before serving.

      <li>I make this cheesecake often, especially in the fall. I don't use special recipe, just make a plain, New York type cheesecake, but add apple pie spices like cinnamon and nutmeg (to taste). Then add diced fresh apples to taste (couple of cups usually). Then top the whole thing with a streusel topping (butter, sugar and a little flour all cut up together) like you would put on a Dutch Apple Pie and bake as the directions for the plain cheesecake suggest. It is wonderful. Edited to MM format by: Lois Flack, CYBEREALM BBS, Watertown, NY - Home of Kook-Net (315)782-1120 - From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Fold apple chunks and Snickers cubes into Cool Whip. Garnish with a fan of thin apple slices. Serve immediately; the apple juice breaks down the Cool Whip after awhile, so don't make this ahead of time. (This may sound weird, but it's delicious! It kind of reminds me of nut-covered caramel apples from the county fair. Kids absolutely love this recipe.) EAT-L Digest 17 August 96 From the EAT-L recipe list.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Golden raisins; plumped</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Chopped walnuts; lightly toasted</li>
      <li>1 pound Tart apples; peeled and cored, very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 Lemon; grated and juice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground allspice</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Unsalted butter; melted and cooled</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fresh bread crumbs</li>
      <li>8 Sheets frozen phyllo dough (18X14in.); at room temperature</li>
      <li>Confectioner's sugar; for dusting</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To plump Raisins: Put raisins in boiling water and let sit 15 minutes, then drain. Mix together in a large bowl the raisins, nuts, apples, sugar, lemon juice, zest and spices. Have the butter and bread crumbs ready. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spread a towel or a couple of sheets of waxed paper on a counter. Working quickly to keep the phyllo from drying out and keeping the remaining sheets covered with a damp towel, place one sheet at the towel long side across. Quickly brush it with some of the melted butter, stroking in one direction to minimize inevitable tears. Place the second sheet about an inch below the first, and brush it with more butter. Continue to overlap the sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter, to make a rectangle about 22 x 14 inches. Scatter the bread crumbs over the phyllo, leaving a 3-inch border all around. Spread the apple mixture evenly over the bread crumbs. Fold over the border of two short sides on top of the filling, then fold over the longer sides. Lifting the towel to help you, roll up the filling along the long side to make a bundle about 16 x 4 x 2 inches. With spatulas, transfer it seam-side down to a buttered baking sheet or jelly-roll pan. Brush the top and ends with the remaining butter and bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let it cool somewhat on the sheet. Dust the strudel with confectioners' sugar, and serve still warm with lightly sweetened whipped cream. NOTES : Ready-made phyllo sheets, although not authentic, substitute well for strudel dough and make the traditional Austrian desert possible without a long day's labor. Have all the filling ingredients ready before you take out the phyllo, and take care to keep the sheets from drying by covering them with damp cloths.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 Pork tenderloin; trimmed of fat, 1-1 1/2 lb</li>
      <li>2 medium Oranges</li>
      <li>1 medium Apple; cored and diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Fine dry plain bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SAUCE</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsweetened apple juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Raisins</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>TO MAKE THE STUFFED PORK TENDERLOIN: Preheat the oven to 425-degrees. Cut a pocket in the side of the tenderloin by cutting a lengthwise slit from one side to almost the other side and stopping about 1/2" from each of the tapered ends. Set the tenderloin aside. Finely shred the peel from the oranges and set aside. Then squeeze 3 tablespoons of juice from the oranges. In a medium bowl, combine the orange juice and apples. Set the apple mixture aside. Spray an unheated small skillet with no-stick spray. Add the onions. Cook and stir over medium heat until tender. Then add the onions and bread crumbs to the apple mixture. Toss until combined. Spoon the bread mixture into the pocket of the tenderloin. Securely close the pocket with wooden toothpicks. Place the tenderloin on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the meat portion only. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until meat thermometer registers 160-degrees. Let stand about 5 minutes before slicing. TO MAKE THE SAUCE: In a small saucepan, use wire whisk to stir together 2 tablespoons of the apple juice and cornstarch. Then stir in the remaining apple juice. Cook and stir over medium heat until boiling. Stir in the reserved orange peel and cinnamon. Add the raisins and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. To serve, slice the tenderloin. Spoon the sauce over slices. Calories: 245, Fat: 4g, % Calories from fat: 16%, Cholesterol: 74.

      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>1 package Rapid-rising dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Very warm water (120 degrees to</li>
      <li>130 Degrees F)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
      <li>1 large Golden delicious or other</li>
      <li>Sweet firm apple, peeled, cored,</li>
      <li>And cut into 1/4-inch thick slices</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Coarse (kosher) salt</li>
      <li>(optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sweet apples and salty bread provide an intriguing contrast in taste. To ensure that the hearth bread remains light and crisp, keep the dough soft: Don't work in too much flour and knead it gently. Makes 1 loaf (6 servings) 1. In large bowl of heavy-duty electric mixer, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, the yeast, and salt. Slowly beat in water, 1/4 cup olive oil, and the honey; vigorously beat mixture 10 minutes. Cover bowl with clean cloth and let dough rise in warm place, away from drafts, 40 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt butter. Add apple slices and saute' until very lightly browned; set aside. 3. After dough has risen 40 minutes, turn out onto floured surface. Gently knead in as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to form a very soft dough - about 1 minute. Gently work apple slices into the dough. 4. Lightly oil large baking sheet. With floured fingers, shape dough into a 9 inch round on oiled sheet. Cover with clean cloth and let rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size - about 30 minutes. 5. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. With pastry brush, coat top of dough round with 2 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle with coarse salt, if desired. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until hearth bread is browned. 6. Drizzle hearth bread with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and serve warm.

(Each spice bag holds enough to mull a 750 ml bottle of red wine - about 3-1/4 cups - or a half gallon - 8 cups - apple cider.)

      <li>1/3 cups Cooking oil</li>
      <li>3 Slightly beaten egg whites</li>
      <li>Granulated sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I have seen several requests for apple muffins lately, so here is my favorite recipe. The multigrain oatmeal is sold in the US by Quaker and can be found in the cereal aisle at the grocery store next to the Quaker rolled oats. If you can't find it, you can probably substitute quick-cooking oats. In a mixing bowl, combine all of the dry ingredients (except granulated sugar). Add the chopped apple and stir to coat with the dry ingredients. Add the remaining ingredients (except granulated sugar) and stir just until moistened. Spray 12 muffin tins with cooking spray (or use papers). Spoon the batter in to the tins, filling them full. Sprinkle muffin tops with a little granulated sugar. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes or until done. Per muffin: 175 calories, 5 g total fat, 24 mg cholesterol, 120 mg solium, 29 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 4 g protein.

She I can think of two reasons for the meat. One is simple - there is a old saying in Judaism (from the days when neither was more than weekly fare any way) - "There is no simcha [joy] without meat and wine." Every meal in the sukkah should be a celebration (that's why I suggested bread with each meal.) Another (and this is pure speculation) may harken all the way back to Temple days, when there would be massive, and ever-increasing, extra daily sacrifices during the week of Sukkot. This is a pilgrimage festival as well, so Jerusalem would be filled with people. It just makes sense that the extra meat (once the priests and Levites get their shares) would be distributed to the crowds. I could easily be wrong - anyone know what happened to all the Sukkot sacrifices? ~- One sharp pepper is better than a basketful of melons. --Jewish Proverb</li>

    <title>Apple Mulling Spice #1</title>
    <category>Beverage</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>25 Cinnamon sticks; ea. 2 inches long (about 3 ounces)</li>
      <li>6 Whole nutmegs (1 ounce)</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Each: chopped dried orange and lemon peel (drying instructions follow)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Each whole allspice and whole cloves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Finely chopped; crystalized ginger (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put cinnamon sticks and nutmeg in a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin or bottom of a small heavy skillet until broken in small pieces. (The nutmeg will be quite stubborn.) Mix with remaining ingredients. Keep the mix in a glass jar until ready to use. Alternatively, you could place 3 generous tablespoons of the mix in a 5-inch square of cheescloth and tie the bundle with string. I don't care for this method as I've found you end up with little floaters of the cheesecloth "string" in the final mulled concoction. I prefer to put some of the mix in a silver tea ball instead. The actual mulling recipe follows: Stir 1/2 cup water and 1/3 cup granulated sugar in a large saucepan. Heat over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Add 3 1/4 cups of wine (red or white) and the spice bag or teaball filled with spice mix. Reduce heat to low, cover and heat very gently until mixture is very hot but not boiling (about 20 minutes). To mull apple juice, add a spice bag to 8 cups of apple juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 30 to 35 minutes. I've also been told that mulled cranberry juice is quite good, but I haven't tried it yet. To dry citrus peel: With a vegetable peeler, remove the colored part of peel from 2 large oranges and 4 lemons. Place in single layer on plate; cover with a paper towel and let stand at room temperature 1 day or until dried. Snip in small pieces with kitchen shears or chop course.

      <li>Date: Tue, 5 Mar 96 13:43:39 EST submitted by: TURNER7@AppleLink.Apple.COM Here's an old recipe that my mom passed down to me. You can tell it's old because it asks you to start in a cold oven and uses oleo (mom said that was used during WWII). I request this for my birthday every year. APPLE NUT CAKE: (Don't use mixer and begin in cold oven.) Mix oil, sugar and eggs. Add apples and nuts. Sift flour, salt and soda; add sifted mixture to above 1/3 at a time, then add 2 tsp. vanilla. Bake in 325! oven (start cold) for 1 1/2 hours in greased tube pan. After cooling, poke holes all over and cover with glaze (below). BROWN SUGAR GLAZE: Cook butter and sugar over low heat until butter melts. Add evaporated milk. Bring to hard boil. Cool and stir; beat with a spoon. Add vanilla. Pour slowly over cake - EAT!!

      <li>When Diane wrote about my Butter Pecan Crunch reminding her of refrigerator cake (layers of graham crackers and pudding), that reminded me of Apple Butter Torte. No one can figure out exactly what this is when they taste it, but they love it anyway. Place two whole graham crackers side by side on a plate (long sides together). Spread with a thin layer of apple butter. Top with two more graham crackers. Spread with another thin layer of apple butter. Continue until you have a stack about 4" high, finishing with graham crackers. "Frost" with Cool Whip on all sides (except the bottom, of course! (g) ). Refrigerate overnight. Slice from one short end. This is beautiful and tasty! EAT-L Digest 22 August 96 From the EAT-L recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

I think he developed it when he came home one night and found little in the pantry except apple butter. What do you think could have caused him to come up with such a recipe? Interesting that he always has soy, sherry, and fresh ginger on hand. It is really quite good. Place the steak on a plate. Mix the remaining ingredients together and rub 2 tablespoons onto the steak, both sides. Allow to marinate for 1/2 hour and then broil on an oven rack to your liking. I enjoy mine a bit rare. Turn once. Slice the steak across the grain of the meat and place the pieces in an oven-proof dish. Pour the remaining sauce on top of the meat and place under the broiler for just a few moments, thus allowing it to glaze a bit. This is delicious served with Rice with Cheese and Onions (see recipe). From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <title>Apple Butter/3 Methods</title>
    <category>Canning</category>
    <category>Crockpot</category>
    <quantity>10</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>16 cups Apple puree</li>
      <li>1 cup Apple cider</li>
      <li>4 cups Sugar; granulated</li>
      <li>4 cups Brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This same recipe can be used to make apple, grape, peach, pear or plum butters. In general use 1 cup fruit pulp to 1/2 cup sugar. Spice to taste and cook slowly. To make apple butter, use tart cooking apples, not the sweet eating varieties. If sweet apples are all you have to use, reduce the sugar by 1/3 to 1/2. Wash, quarter and core the unpeeled fruit. Place in a heavy kettle with just enough water to prevent scorching. Cook until soft, stirring frequently, and press through a food mill. Mix ingredients in a heavy kettle and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until thick. When ready, a spoonful put on a plate should hold its shape and not 'weep' liquid around the edges of the mound after sitting for five minutes. This usually takes about two hours of cooking but can take as long as four, so plan this project for a day when you have other things to do in the kitchen. Don't try and hurry the process as the mixture can easily burn and burned apple butter is only good for the compost pile. Stir frequently, and if possible use a 'heat difuser' between the burner and the kettle. Oven Method: Cook the fruit butter in a roasting pan in a 250 - 300 F. oven until thick; may take 6 to 8 hours. Stir occasionally. It needs less stirring this way but uses take much more energy and can be awkward to stir. Crockpot Method: Put ingredients in crockpot and cook, uncovered, for about 12 hours, stirring occasionally, until it passes the test given above. When finished, pack into jars per standard canning methods and process pints 5 minutes or quarts 10 minutes in a boiling water bath.

      <li>2 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour; sifted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baker's Ammonia; * see note</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cream butter and sugar at least 10 minutes by hand, or 5 minutes in electric mixer. The mixture should be thick and white. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. If the baker's ammonia is in granular form, crush to a powder with a rolling pin or a bottle. Sift flour and bakers ammonia together. Stir flour into egg mixture and blend thoroughly. Dough will be soft. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Cut 6 to 8 -- 8" rounds from waxed paper. Spread the dough thinly and evenly on paper rounds, leaving about half-inch margin to allow for expansion during baking. Place to or three round (whatever it will hold) on a baking sheet. Bake at 400° 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown on edges. Remove at once from cookie sheet, but do not remove paper until you are ready to assemble cake. Assemble by placing well-spiced apple butter between each layer. Leave top unadorned. *The baker's amonia (ammonium carbonate or hartshorn) may be bought at drugstores. Or 3 3/4 tsp baking powder may be substituted.

    <title>Apple Butter</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>10 pints Apples; peeled and slice (20 cups?)</li>
      <li>1 quart Apple cider or juice</li>
      <li>5 cups Brown sugar (this is a lot; adjust to suit your taste)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground allspice</li>
      <li>Lemon juice &amp; grated lemon peel to taste (my suggestion, gives it a little tang)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From checking my cookbooks, I would say that the difference between apple/ pear sauce and apple/pear butter is one of degree, the latter being sweeter, thicker and spicier and is made by cooking down apples with apple juice and spices. Here's a recipe from Jean Hewitt's _The New York Times: The New Natural Foods Cookbook_. Combine apples and cider in a large kettle, bring to boil, and simmer, covered, until apples are soft. Pass through a food mill or puree in a blender or food processor. Combine strained applesauce with remaining ingredients in kettle. Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Cook gently, uncovered, until mixture becomes quite thick, at least 2 1/2 hours, Stir often. Pour into hot sterilized jars and seal. Process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. (You could also freeze in small portions and store what you are currently using in the refrigerator.) Yield: about 2 quarts (8 cups is a lot of apple butter, you could cut the recipe down or give away as gifts.) Another suggestion: buy unsweetened apple sauce and add sugar and spices and cook til very thick for semi-homemade apple butter. Also, substitute ripe pears for apples or use a combination.

      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil 18 muffin cups or coat with nonstick cooking spray. In a large bowl, stir together flours, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir in carrots, apples and raisins. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together eggs, egg whites, apple butter, oil and vanilla. Add to the dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full. In a small bowl, combine walnuts and wheat germ; sprinkle over the muffin tops. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and spring back when lightly pressed. Makes 18 muffins. From Eating Well. I know that you can substitute applesauce for the apple butter, although it might be nice to keep some around as an oil substitute. (They used it to cut down on the fat content.)

    <recipetext>
      <li>Boil cider or juice uncovered over high heat until reduced to about 2 1/2 cups. Pare, core and thinly slice apples, measure them well packed, then add to liquid. Simmer uncovered over low heat, stirring often, until mixture begins to boil. Add remaining ingredients and continue to cook until mixture is quite thick, stirring often so it won't stick. When a little bit placed on a cold plate cools to a spreading consistency, it is ready. Pour into sterilized jars, cover, and keep in a cool place. Yield: 4-5 jelly glasses. NOTES : A Mennonite sweet, marvelous on toast or hot homemade bread, the ingredients for this are available all year around. But, for me, the very best apple butter is made with the first summer sour apples.

      <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Melt first 2 ingredients together in a 9"-square cake pan by putting the pan with the ingredients into the oven as it is preheating. While the ingredients are melting, mix the next 4 ingredients together and then mix them into the melted butter and honey. Lay apple slices in the syrup to completely cover the bottom of the cake pan in an attractive way. (You may need more than one apple if you use a small one.) Fill a 1-cup measuring cup with pitted dates, but don't pack the dates into the cup. With the dates in the cup, fill the cup with water, then pour both dates and water into a blender. Add 1/2 cup more water into the blender. Now blend till it forms a smooth, thick paste. Add the 1/4 cup butter or margarine and blend till totally whipped in. Put the blender mixture into a mixing bowl and add the last 5 dry ingredients. Mix just long enough to thoroughly blend in all the dry ingredients. Pour this batter on top of apple slices and spread evenly in the cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or till a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. When done, remove from oven and immediately turn the cake pan upside down to empty out onto a serving platter.

      <li>Date: Wed, 12 Jun 1996 10:00:37 -0500 From: joeanddi@aristotle.net (Joe and Dianne Fago) Here is a quick and super easy recipe for apple butter that I found on the back of a jar of Seneca Natrual AppleSauce. I like it, because it has no added sugar. I love it on top of pancakes and waffles. Combine all ingredients in a blender container and blend until smooth. Pour pureed mixture into a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 1 hour and 20 minutes with the lid ajar to allow steam to escape. Cool to room temperature in the original applesauce jar or other container. Store covered container in refrigerator. Makes about 2 1/2 pounds of apple butter. From: Seneca Applesauce.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Cake Mix all-purpose flour; sifted baking powder salt granulated sugar shortening</li>
      <li>1 Egg equivalent using scrambled egg mix</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Powdered milk</li>
      <li>Apple Mix</li>
      <li>4 cups Tart apples; sliced, pared and cored</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice and finely shredded peel</li>
      <li>Cinnamon mix cinnamon nutmeg granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Apricot jam</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Margarine; small pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Apple Cake: 1-3 hours steaming at the edge of the fire. Tools: Large pot for steaming with a lid or alumimum foil to cover; 2-3 quart pot with lid or heavy duty foil to seal top - that fits inside the large pot (nestled pot kit works well). Prepare in advance: Mix together the flour, dried egg mix, dried milk powder, baking powder, salt, and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. With two knives, cut the shortening into the flour until mixture is mealy. Store in a zip lock bag, Peel the apples and slice them. Put them in a zip lock bag with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and any finely chopped lemon peel that is available. Apple mixture may be frozen. Mix the cinnamon, nutmeg, and t tablespoons of sugar and stone in a small ziplock bag. At the camp site: Make a well in the center of the flour mixture in the bag and add the water. Stir the mixture to form smooth batter, turn into greased smaller pot. Arrange the apples in rows on top, pushing them halfway into the dough. Sprinkle over the apples and dot with apricot jam. Cut small pieces of butter over all. Cover the cake pot with lid or heavy duty foil. Put the smaller pot inside the larger one and fill along the sides with hot water until the water is about 2/3 or 3/4 of the way up the sides of the cake pot. Place the lid on the large pot and place it on the edge of the fire so the water simmers and just boils. Check from time to time and add more water as it boils down. As long as the water does not boil dry, this cannot be overcooked.

Up to 1 pound of velvetta cheese can be used Use of mexican flavored velvetta adds flavor options. Use Hot Mexican only if all who will eat it agree.</li>

      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice</li>

      <li>Date: Mon, 30 Jan 1995 12:37:36 -0600 From: Stephanie da Silva &lt;arielle@bonkers.taronga.com&gt; Melt the lard in a saucepan and let it cool. Cut the apples in quarters and remove the cores and skin, then cut into thin slices. Place the apple slices in a bowl and sprinkle the lemon juice over them. Place 1 cup of the flour in a second bowl and make a well in it. Dissolve the yeast in the water and pour it into the well; stir with a wooden spoon. Add the sugar, melted lard, grated lemon peel and eggs, and when these ingredients are all well incorporated, sprinkle in the remaining flour. Stir very well, until the dough is smooth and very soft, then add the soaked raisins (I left them out cause I didn't have any) and half the apple slices, mixing them in well. Place the dough in an oiled cake mold or springform pan and arrange the remaining apple slices on top. Cover with a dish towel and let the dough rise until it is almost doubled in bulk. When the dough has risen, remove the towel and bake in a preheated 400F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden brown. Let the cake cool for 30 minutes before turning out.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Idaho or russet potatoes; each weighing about 8 ounces</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 Red bell peppers; seeded and finely julienned</li>
      <li>1 pound Mushrooms; stemmed and finely sliced</li>
      <li>Pesto; to taste, sun dried tomato or black olive paste</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Yogurt or chunk parmesan cheese, optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash the potatoes, prick them and bake for about an hour or until done. (If kids don't like very crunchy exterior, scrub the potatoes clean, wrap them in foil and then bake; they will then steam rather than bake.) Meanwhile, heat olive oil and saute peppers and mushrooms until tender. Remove from heat and stir in pesto, or other paste to taste and season with salt and pepper. When potatoes are done, split them almost all the way to the bottom and squeeze up some of the potato flesh; spoon vegetable topping over and around potatoes. If you did not add pesto or other paste, top with yogurt; if you added pesto or other paste, top with shaved Parmesan. Yield: 4 servings Variations: Fresh chopped tomatoes, mixed with olive oil and chiffonade of basil 2 cups pureed cottage cheese mixed with 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes or 1 tablespoon prepared pesto Bean or meat chili Smoked salmon, chives and sour cream Twice baked Southwest: scoop out filling from potatoes which are baked, mix with cheddar cheese, sour cream, green chilis or jalapenos and scallions, refill and reheat for 15 minutes or in microwave if you don't mind losing crisp texture of outside skin.

      <li>2 Cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>Salt/pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>cut 2-3 incisions in the skin of the fish on both sides and rub inside and out with mixture of pepper/salt and a bit of oil. Put the garlic inside the fish. Sprinkle with parsley , set aside, leave one hour. put fish in a baking dish. Prepare tahina sauce and (optional) add 1/2-1 tsp hot chili or some type of harissa ( prepared ok). Pour the sauce over the fish.. bake 350 oven for 30 minutes ( or until the fish is tender). Serve with lemon wedges, /lightly toasted pine nuts or almonds rice is a great addition...to sop up the sauce... also pita... Note: you can be creative...sometimes I just put lots of parsley and garlic in the tahina...but you have to know who you are feeding, and if they like things with a bit more punch. The tahina gets sort of golden.. and there is never any left. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #77 Date: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 10:27:06 +0200 From: shust@inter.net.il</li>

Meanwhile, lay the fish on a plate or dish to cover the saucepan and cover it with a second plate, lid or foil. Put the fish on the pan when the water is boiling, then reduce the heat so water does not froth over. Cook the potatoes until tender-10-15 minutes if the chucks are faily small. Set the aside, without uncovering it. Drain and mash the potatoes, beating the well until smooth. Mix in the butter, milk, lemon peel, parsley and anchovy extract, is used Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a quicke dish or baking pan. Pour any cooking juices from the fish into the potato mixture. Flake the flash off the skin, discarded any bones, and at it to the potatoes. Mix well, adding seasoning to taste. Use a large spoon to place the fish mixture in a mound on the prepared dish or pan but do not flatten it until it is all in mounded up. Flatten the top of the mixture sightly, then sprinkle it with a little of the flour. Use a spatula and slice to flatten the mixture into a little neat circle, about 7" across. Pat the sides with the knife and the top with slice to that the mixture is even and neatly shaped, keep sprinkling with the flour to coat the outside evenly. Trickle the oil over the fish cake and bake it for about 30 minutes, until well browned. Cut into wedges to serve.

      <li>From: Pat Gold &lt;plgold@ix.netcom.com&gt; Date: Fri, 12 Jul 1996 18:11:53 -0700 I came across a magazine called "La Cocina Italiana" today ... I think this is issue # 2. At any rate there were 3 recipes in an article called Kosher (In Accordance with the Jewish Dietary Laws) and although I haven't tried them they sounded interesting enough to post to the list. "Cooking Kosher with Colette Rossant". 1. Preheat the oven to 375-degrees F. 2. Brush a baking pan with olive oil. Line the pan with the sliced onions, celery and carrots. 3. Rub the fish with the remaining olive oil mixed with the soy sauce. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity with the herbs and garlic. 4. Place the fish on the onions, and top the fish with sliced tomatoes. 5. Bake the fish for 25 minutes or until it flakes easily with a fork. Serve with the rhubarb sauce. Rhubarb Sauce (Serves 4) 1. Place all the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until the rhubarb is cooked. 2. Pour the sauce in a sauceboat and serve with the fish at room temperature.

Use one pan for each six servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served without freezing. Place rice in a large baking pan. Add salt and water. Stir. Cover and bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Combine cooked rice with remaining ingredients. Pour one-fourth of the mixture into each 8x8-inch baking pan. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets. TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING: Preheat oven to 400ø F. (hot). Bake 45 minutes or until pepper flakes and onion are tender. TO FREEZE: Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans. TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD: Preheat oven to 400ø F. (hot). Remove freezer wrap. Place food in baking pan.

      <li>In a 10 inch skillet, melt the 1/2 cup of butter. Add garlic and onion and saute until onions are translucent. Add scallops and cook 2 or 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and white wine to taste. Add sufficient bread crumbs to prepare a moist stuffing. Place each flounder fillet dark-side-up on a flat surface. Placing the scallop stuffing in the center of each fillet, divide evenly among the fillets. Fold both ends of each fillet over the stuffing, overlapping the ends. Pour the melted butter and the hot water into a 9x12 inch baking dish. Transfer the stuffed fillets to the baking dish and bake 20 minutes while you prepare a white sauce. WHITE SAUCE: In a small saucepan, melt butter, then whisk in flour. Cook over low heat 2-3 minutes, whisking constantly. Then add milk, and salt, pepper, and white wine to taste. Increase heat to medium, whisking constantly until the sauce is thickened. Cook several minutes over low heat, stirring. When the flounder has baked 20 minutes, pour the white sauce over the stuffed fillets. Return the baking dish to the oven briefly and heat until the sauce begins to bubble. -From Diana Rattray Recipe By : Country Inns and Back Roads Cookbook From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>I take fish fillets (any kind) and put them in an oven proof dish. I cover with Green Giant vegetable mixtures (any kind that you prefer or their pasta accents) and then add 1/2 can of tomatoes. I bake in an oven warmed to 350 for about 20 minutes. Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and serve with rice, baked potato, pasta or just a salad. It's delicious and doesn't cost any optional calories. 2 oz. cooked fish = 1 protein selection. This is my own concoction for fish but I cooked it for my sister-in-law and she loved it. I'm not much of a fish eater but with 2 for 1 on the protein, it's becoming more popular in my diet plans.

      <li>Wish I could show you all the picture of this dish. The quail are a gorgeous deep reddish orange in color. I imagine that this would be a great recipe to use on chicken wings. And they'd definitely be hot++ check out the amount of sambal oelek, the Indonesian condiment made of crushed bird's eye chilies, garlic and vinegar. I'm making this tomorrow with a hacked up chicken and a double recipe of the marinade. I'll start marinating it tonight. It would probably be great with a game hen as well. Stay tuned++a report will follow. 1: Cut quail in half through centres. Combine garlic, sambal oelek, honey, sauce, sugar and oil in bowl, add quail, stir well; cover, refrigerate overnight. 2: Just before serving, place quail on rack over baking dish, bake in moderate oven for 15 minutes, increase temperature to hot, cook further 10 minutes or until quail are crisp and tender. Makes 4 servings. Quail can be prepared 2 days ahead. Storage: Covered, in refrigerator. Freeze: Uncooked quail suitable. Microwave: Not suitable.

      <li>Trim away any visible fat from the steak. Sear the steak in the oil over medium to med-high heat. Place the steak in a casserole dish. For extra flavoring, pour the water into the skillet you seared the meat in, and stir. Pour this over the meat, then add all the other ingredients. Cook uncovered at 350F for 30 minutes, or longer if you prefer your meat well done. Makes 4 servings, 4.5 oz each, plus sauce, but without optional gravy.

      <li>1 Parmesan cheese; shredded</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt butter with oil in large soup pot - add sliced onions and stir to coat ~ cover pot and cook over moderately low heat for 15 - 20 minutes - stirring occasionally until onions are tender and translucent. Uncover pot and raise heat to moderately high - stir in salt and sugar (sugar carmelizes and helps onions to brown) - cook about 30 minutes - stirring frequently until onions have turned an even deep golden brown. Lower heat to moderate - stir in flour and add a bit more butter if flour does not absorb into a paste with the onions. Cook slowly, stirring constantly for 12 minutes to brown flour lightly. Remove from heat - pour about 1 cup of warmed consomme into onion/flour mixture to blend flour and consomme - add rest of consomme, water, wine, bay leaf and sage - bring to a simmer. Simmer slowly for 30 - 40 minutes. If you are not serving right away, let cool, uncovered, then cover and refrigerate. Reheat when ready to serve - place in ovenproof soup bowls - top with a slice of toasted french bread, shredded mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese. Place under broiler to melt cheeses until bubbly. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V5 #021 by lena36@juno.com (Lena P Mitchell) on Jan 20, 1998</li>

      <li>Rinse beans and discard any stones. In a large pot, soak beans overnight in water with baking soda, oregano, cumin and green pepper. The next day, add onion, garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, sherry and salt to the water and cook on medium-low heat for about 3 hours or until the beans are very tender and liquid is reduced and somewhat thickened. Make sure liquid in pot does not entirely boil away. To prevent beans from burning, add more water when necessary.

Heat water and salt in a saucepan 'til warm to the touch (110 F) Mix water into flour to form a dough. Knead for 10 - 12 minutes until smooth and elastic (earlobe consistency), adding remaining flour as necessary to make a barely sticky dough. Form the dough into an 8 inch long cylinder, and cut it into 8 equally sized pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball (try to remove any seams by rolling it between your hands. Poke your thumb through the center of each piece and twirl it between your index fingers to make a hole. Place uncooked bagels on a floured cookie sheet and allow to rise 20 to 30 minutes in a warm place until doubled in bulk. (gas oven with the pilot light on, electric oven with light on, sunny window or countertop next to warm oven) Preheat oven to 375F (400F if you want a thicker crust). In a 4 qt pot boil 8 cups water and 1/2 tsp salt. Drop bagels, 3 at a time into the boiling water. Cook uncovered 3 - 5 minutes over high heat, turn once with a slotted spoon. Remove bagels and transfer to a well oiled or floured baking sheet. Bake at 375F for 25-30 minutes or 400f for 20 minutes until firm to the touch. Cool on racks. Enjoy. Variations: 1. Garlic bagels: add 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 tbsp onion flakes to dry ingreds. 2. Herbed bagels: add 2 tsp dried mixed herbs. 3. Millet bagels: substitute 1 cup millet meal or flour and 1-1/2 to 2 cups spelt or whole wheat bread flour in the basic recipe. I got this recipe from a magazine called Veggie Life (july issue).

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Blanched whole almonds (about 7 ounces)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>3 1/2 tablespoons Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>3 ounces Bitterswet (not unsweetened) or swmisweet</li>
      <li>Chocolate, chopped fairly fine</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons (generous) almond extract</li>
      <li>2 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>2 To 5 Tbl confectioners' sugar for rolling out cookies</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 325F. Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil. In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar until the almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor and scrape down the sides several times. Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, and chocolate; continue processing until the chocolate is finely ground. Add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, the almond extract, and egg whites; process until the mixture is blended and just forms a mass. Set the dough aside for 5 to 10 minutes to stiffen slightly. Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar. If the dough seems too soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead until the consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar than absolutely necessary. Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, lifting it with a spatula frequently and redusting the surface and rolling pin with powdered sugar to prevent sticking. Cut out the cookies using a 2 1/4-inch heart-shaped (or similar) cutter. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart. Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and slightly puffy. Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until completely cooled. Peel from the foil. Store airtight for 3 to 4 days. Freeze, airtight, for longer storage. Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies. [THE BALTIMORE SUN; November 25. 1990] Posted by Fred Peters.

      <li>Ingredient Group: INFO ONLY</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Baking is a joy, not a chore, and should never be undertaken if you are feeling rushed. Use your imagination and alter the add-ins as you see fit. 1. Always read through the entire recipe before starting to Bake. 2. Start with ingredients at room temperature. 3. Always Bake bars, squares and cookies in the centre of the oven on the middle rack. If baking more than one pan at a time, place them at different angles on different racks to allow maximum circulation of heat. Alternate their placement on the racks halfway through the baking time. 4. The best pans are aluminum or metal pans that are light in colour. Dark pans will cause the base or bar to Bake and brown more quickly. 5. If using glass dishes, reduce oven temperature by 25 degrees and slightly decrease the baking time. 6. Use only the size of pan called for. The difference between an 8-inch square pan and a 9-inch square pan can mean the difference between a moist, chewy bar and an under baked, heavy failure. 7. Check baked goods at earliest time indicated. Over baking will dry out bars and squares. 8. If making a sticky or fluffy batter or base, wet your hands or spatula with water before patting or spreading the batter in the pan. 9. Let most bars cool completely before cutting. There are exceptions, however. Bars with a sticky filling need to have a knife run around the edge of the pan after being removed from the oven to prevent sticking. 10. Score chocolate-topped bars as soon as the topping is applied to prevent the chocolate from cracking later. 11. Use metal or plastic dry measures for measuring dry ingredients and glass wet measures for measuring liquid ingredients. 12. All-purpose flour does not need to be sifted. However, when a recipe calls for cake-and-pastry flour, the flour should be sifted and then measured. 13. Store nuts in the freezer to retain their freshness.

      <li>Ingredient Group: LAMB COUSCOUS WITH 7</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>There must be seven vegetables, never fewer - usually onion, carrot, green peppers, courgettes, turnip, white cabbage, aubergine. An eighth is essential, tomato. The lamb, too, is crucial. Tender 2 month old lamb is best, because it is tender. It is skinny. It has no fat, but is has the flavour of the herbs it feeds on, thyme, rosemary, wild fennel. Basically, everything cooks in the pot for an hour, but the hard vegetables go in first and the tender vegetables for the last 20 minutes. That's it. It cooks at a rolling boil, and there's the rub. For the last half hour, the couscous has to be cooked in a colander above it, where it steams. We have problems trying to mimic this. For a start, we can't buy the quality of couscous he uses; one which readily takes on the flavours of the stew steaming underneath, and absorbs a certain amount of butter. Most couscous sold in Britain, and France too, is pre-cooked, so follow the instructions on the packet. (Note, if it is too robustely steamed it will cook to a mush suitable only for invalids.) But for interest, should you be able to obtain authentic grain, this is how he cooks it. (Middle Eastern shops should stock it. It has a gutsy texture and character.) This is what Monsieur Boujeema Mars, eminent chef des cuisines, La Mamounia, Marrakech, Morrocco, does: There are three stages. He wets 12 ounces of couscous with one cup of water only. He lines a colander (which fits over his stew pan) with muslin, and put the couscous inside. Using the muslin, he ensures a tight seal between pan and colander. He places the lid loosely on top and steams the couscous for 10 minutes. He removes the colander, stirs in a knob of butter, adds another cup of water, and steams it a further ten minutes. He repeats the process a third time, making the cooking time 30 minutes in all.

      <li>1 pound Fresh pasta</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Basics for new cooks: In large pot, cover and bring water and salt to full rolling boil. Stir in pasta, separating pieces; return to boil and boil, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 1-3 minutes or until tender but firm. Drain well.

      <li>Hello, Barbecue Enthusiasts! Barbecue Sauce is for those who savor intense spicy flavors on their grilled meats and seafoods. It is not a marinade and should only be splashed on the finished meat just before it is removed from the grill and served. Barbecue Sauce is a grilling sauce that has a thicker consistency than a marinade, so the meat will not absorb the flavors until it has been cooked. Barbecue sauces come in a veritable plethora of flavors including spicy, hot, garlic, mustard, brown sugar, honey, KC style, oriental, thick and chunky, smooth and creamy, French, herb-based, smoke house . . . The list goes on. Simply stated, barbecue sauce is a matter of one's personal taste preferences and The Cook and Kitchen Staff strongly recommend that you develop your own sauce that suits your personal taste. Here are some to get you started: Basic Barbecue Sauce: Combine the following ingredients in a large saucepan: 1 quart vinegar, 1 32-oz. bottle ketchup, 1 32-oz. French or Western Salad Dressing, 1 cup sugar, 2 Tbs. lemon juice, 2 Tbs. ground red pepper, 2 Tbs. ground black pepper, and 1 tsp. salt. Simmer on low heat until the sauce is thick and creamy. As an option, add 2 or 3 Tbs. liquid smoke during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Teriyaki Barbecue Sauce: Combine 2/3 cup Soy Sauce, 1/4 cup Olive Oil, 1 Tbs. Ground Ginger, 1 Tbs. Garlic Salt, 3 Tbs. Brown Sugar, and 1 tsp. Ground Mustard. Add finely chopped fresh mushrooms and green peppers for a chunky sauce. Add more brown sugar or 1 Tbs. flour or cornstarch for a thicker sauce. Perfect barbecue sauce for beef or chicken kabobs with whole fresh mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, fresh chunks of pineapple, and green peppers. Goes well with rice, Chinese Noodles, and Oriental Cole Slaw. Hot Barbecue Sauce: Prepare basic sauce recipe and add 1 or 2 tsp. of Tobasco or a can of diced green chilies ranging from jalapeno to poblano. Great with chicken, seafood, or pork. Best served with baked potatoes, cornbread, or a plain pasta salad to tone down the heat. Honey Barbecue Sauce: Add 1/2 cup honey to basic barbecue sauce recipe. Perfect for Chicken or Cornish Hens. Mustard Barbecue Sauce: Substitute any type of prepared mustard for ketchup in the basic barbecue sauce recipe. Great on Seafood or Poultry. Garlic Barbecue Sauce: Add 1 to 3 Tbs. fresh minced Garlic, depending on the strength of garlic flavor desired, to the basic barbecue sauce. Add up to 1/2 cup of finely minced onions for extra zing, or add both 1/2 cup finely minced onions and green bell peppers for a really hearty barbecue sauce. Makes a little thicker sauce for use on any type of Seafood, Meat, or Poultry. Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by Recipe-a-Day &lt;recipe-a-day@bignetwork.com&gt; on May 9, 1998</li>

    <title>Basic Boiled Potatoes</title>

    <category>Potatoes</category>
    <category>Southern</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Uniform-sized potatoes</li>
      <li>Unsalted butter; melted (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper in a pepper mill; to taste (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. If the potatoes are refrigerated, take them out of the refrigerator at least half an hour before you cook them. Wash them under cold, running water, scrubbing off any dirt without breaking the skin, and put them in a large kettle that will easily hold all the potatoes. Add enough water to cover them by about an inch. Take the potatoes out, cover the kettle, and put it over medium-high heat. 2. When the water is nearly but not quite boiling, add the potatoes. Now let the water come to a full, rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook at a bare simmer until they are tender. It is impossible to give exact times; it can take from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the size and age of your potatoes. 3. Drain off all the water and let the potatoes sit, uncovered, in a warm place for about 5 minutes. Have a heated bowl ready. Quickly peel the potatoes with your hands (don't use a knife or potato peeler), the skins will skip right off. Put them in the bowl as they are peeled. 4. Serve them tossed with melted butter, salt, and a liberal grinding of black pepper, if desired, or use as directed in other recipes. NOTES : A side bar says: Start with good potatoes; The potatoes should be be same size (roughly). Don't cut them to uniform size either, since this would expose the inner potato to water. Resist the temptation to rinse the potatoes in cold water to speed the peeling.

    <title>Basic Bread Sponge</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <category>Starter</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Water; 105-115 degrees</li>
      <li>4 cups All-purpose flour; unbleached</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Whisk the yeast into the water. Allow to sit for about three minutes. Add the flour, mixing for another three minutes. Place in a nonreactive bowl and cover. Allow to sit in a draft-free spot until it rises and gets thick and sticky. This will take about eight hours. Use a spoon to stir the sponge down before measuring for use in a bread. Once risen, refrigerate for up to three days. Allow to come to room temperature before using. If it goes beyond three days, discard all but 1 cup of the sponge and make the recipe, adding the reserved sponge with the flour. Stir for two or three minutes before using. For all of the breads based upon this sponge, allow two days since the doughs require overnight refrigeration. For the best results, use as little of the kneading flour as possible. To allow yourself to slide the loaves into the oven, form them on a baking sheet without sides or on the bottom of one with sides that is turned upside-down. If you do not have a stone or tiles, bake directly on the baking sheet(s) upon which you formed the loaves (be sure to use either cornmeal or parchment between the dough and the sheet). All of the breads based upon the sponge can be frozen for up to two weeks. Don't freeze until the bread has cooled thoroughly - then wrap in foil and freeze. When ready to use, thaw them, still wrapped, at room temperature overnight. Then, unwrap and warm at 350 degrees for 5 or 10 minutes. Alternatively, you could warm the frozen and wrapped loaves at 300 for 35 to 40 minutes. &gt;From: "steven.h.bergstein" &lt;steven.h.bergstein@ac.com&gt; From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe Recipe By : Amy Scherber, Food&amp;Wine 2/93</li>

Pick over carefully and wash, removing stems, hulls, and debris. Place in enameled or stainless steel pot, mash well, and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Cook just until berries soften. Put through food mill. If desired, this pulp may be strained through a finer sieve. Measure pulp into an enameled or stainless steel pot that is at least four times taller than level of pulp. For every cup of pulp, add 1 cup of sugar. Bring to a boil over moderately high heat and continue to boil until the temperature of the jam reaches 221 degrees F on a candy thermometer. (The stage at which the mixture will form a jelly of the desired consistency if a spoonful on a small dish is placed in the freezer for one minute.) Keep an eye on the boiling jam and stir frequently! When jam is ready, ladle into sterilized jars, seal, and process according to jar manufacturer's instructions. NOTES : Berries may be blackberry, blueberry, raspberry, or strawberry MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MasterCook recipe list.

Add flour and olive oil and mix, using hands until you can knead the dough without it sticking to your fingers. Wash and dry hands and remove ball to cutting board. Knead the dough, occasionally dusting with 1 teaspoon flour, until a firm, smooth homogenous ball is formed, about 15 minutes. Place ball of dough in a lightly oiled mixing bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise in a warm place until its size is doubled, about 2 hours. Punch down and divide into 4 pieces. Dough is now ready for use. Recipe By : MOLTO MARIO Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #280 Date: Tue, 5 Nov 1996 17:14:56 -0500 (EST) From: Sue &lt;suechef@sover.net&gt;</li>

      <li>My kids were home from school Monday because of the Martin Luther King holiday, so we tried something new for breakfast. It was a hit! This recipe comes from Taste of Home magazine, December 97/January 98 issue, and was submitted to it by Lorna Greene of Harrington, Maine. In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients. In another bowl, mash bananas; add oil and vanilla. Mix well. Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups half full. Bake at 375 for 18-22 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Yield: 1 dozen (We ate them hot from the pan. I had two, and my two children - ages 8 and 9 - ate the rest!) Posted to TNT Recipes Digest, Vol 01, Nr 955 by Nora &amp; Terry Turner &lt;turner1@iamerica.net&gt; on Jan 21, 1998</li>

    <quantity>50</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2/3 cups Clover honey</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kirsch (cherry brandy) or orange juice</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>Finely grated peel (yellow part only) of one</li>
      <li>Large lemon</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped candied lemon peel</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped candied orange peel</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Finely chopped blanched slivered almonds</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups All-purpose or unbleached white flour (or more)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oven to 350F. Generously grease two 10-by-14-inch or larger baking shets. Stir together the honey, sugar, and kirsch in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar completely dissolves and the mixture is hot but not boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the spices, lemon peel, candied peels, and almonds until completely incorporated. Stirring vigorously, gradually ad 2 1/4 cups of flour to the pan; the mixture will become very stiff. If the mixture feels sticky and too soft to roll out, stir or knead in a bit more flour, but be careful not to overflour. Set the mixture aside until cooled to barely warm. Sprinkle a work surface generously with flour. Divide the dough in half. Roll out half of dough into an 8 1/2-by-13-inch rectangle, frequently running a spatula under the dough and dusting the work surface. As needed, also dust the top of the dough and the rolling pin with flour. Transfer the dough to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Prick the dough lightly all over with the tines of a fork. Stagger the baking sheets on racks in the center third of the oven; switch positions halfway through the baking to ensure even browning. Bake for 13 to 16 minutes or until the dough top is just tinged with brown and slightly darker on the edges; avoid overbaking, as cookies will become crunchy and hard. Carefully run a spatula under the dough rectangles to loosen them from the pans. When just cool enough to handle, transfer the rectangles to a cutting board and cut away any uneven, dry edges using a large serrated knife. Deeply score the rectangles, but do not cut completely through the surface, lengthwise and crosswise, to yield 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. Return the scored rectangles to the baking sheets. In a small saucepan stir together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of water until thoroughly blended. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Boil, stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds, until smooth, very fluid, and translucent. Divide the mixture between the rectangles, pour over the top and quickly spread the glaze over the entire surface. Let stand until the glaze sets and turns white again, about 1 hour. Bend the rectangles to break apart or cut through the score marks to separate into bars. Let stand until the glaze is dry and hard. Pack airtight. Store for up to 3 weeks or more. Makes 50 to 60 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. [THE BALTIMORE SUN; November 25, 1990] Posted by Fred Peters.

    <title>Basic Boiled Jerusalem Artichokes</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Jerusalem artichokes</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Ulsalted butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Wash and gently scrub the artichokes under cook, running water. If they have just come out of the refrigerator, let them until they warm to room temperature, about an hour. 2. Put just enough cold water to cover the artichokes in a kettle that will comfortably hold them. Turn on the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a boil. 3. Throw in a small handful of salt and add the artichokes. Let the water return to biling and reduce the heat to medium. Simmer, uncovered, until they are to the level of tenderness that the individual recipe requires. To eath them plain or in salads, they should be just tender and may take as little as 10 minutes ; for creamed, or mashed, artichokes, they should be as soft as boiled potatoes and may take as long as half an hour. 4. Drain them well and serve warm with lots of melted butter following a recipe for mashed potatoes.

Add all the remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer uncovered at the lowest possible heat for 4 hours.
