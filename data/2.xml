Cover and chill.) Preheat oven to 350øF. Using small sharp knife, cut 2-inch-long slit in 1 side of each bread slice, cutting 3/4 of way through bread and creating pocket that leaves 3 sides of bread intact. Divide banana mixture equally among pockets in bread. Whisk milk, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, vanilla and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl to blend. Pour into large glass baking dish. Place bread in egg mixture; let soak 10 minutes, turning occasionally. Place almonds in shallow bowl. Carefully remove bread from egg mixture and coat both sides with almonds. Place bread on heavy large baking sheets. Mix brown sugar, oats, flour and remaining 2 teaspoons cinnamon in medium bowl. Add remaining 1/4 cup butter and rub in, using fingertips, until moist clumps form. Sprinkle topping over bread. Bake French toast until topping is golden brown and filling is hot, about 25 minutes. Transfer toast to plates. Serve hot with maple syrup. Bon App‚tit December 1996 Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #167 by Julie Bertholf &lt;jewel1@ix.netcom.com&gt; on Jun 30, 1997</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly grease 12 2-1/2 inch muffin cups. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl. Beat bananas in a large bowl with an electric mixer until mashed. Add eggs, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla, beating until blended. Stir in combined dry ingredients with a wooden spoon until just blended. Stir in blueberries until just combined. Spoon into prepared muffin cups, dividing batter equally. Sprinkle tops of muffins with granulated sugar and bake 20-22 minutes, until golden brown. Remove muffins from pan and cool on wire rack. You can substitute the 6 Tbsp butter with 1/4 c nonfat yogurt, and these come out fine. The fat from the 2 eggs is negligible when divided by 12. * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627 Posted by FAYLEN Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #703 by Lisa Clarke &lt;lisa@gaf.com&gt; on Aug 1, 9</li>

A great dessert with no sugar added. Cut the bananas into quarter-inch slices, coat with the lemon juice, place on a cookie sheet, and freeze. After the bananas are frozen, puree them with the remaining ingredients in the appliance of your choice (my cuisinart had to work pretty hard, but it was very entertaining for the son to watch strawberries become sorbet.) Serve immediately in chilled cups. Leftovers don't freeze well, but they make a nice flavoring for homemade yogurt. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Unbleached white flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>Medium banana, just ripe</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Jack or mild cheddar cheese*</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*cut in small thin slices. Note: the empanadas may be sauted or baked. If you are going to bake them, preheat oven to 375F and butter a cookie sheet. 1)Combine flour and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Make a well in the center. 2)Pour in the water and stir until reasonably well combined. Then turn out on a floured surface and knead until smooth (5 minutes). 3)Divide the dough into 8 equal parts, and knead each one into a small ball. Set the balls aside. 4)Peel the banana and cut it laterally into quarters. Cut each quarter in half lengthwise. 5)Roll out each ball of dough into a circle approximately 5 inches in diameter. Place a couple of small cheese slices near the center, and cut a 1/8-inch piece of the banana into several small strips on top of the cheese. Lightly brush the edges of the dough with water, and fold the dough over the filling, as you would a turnover. Crimp the edges securely with a fork. Set the finished empanada aside and repeat until you have 8. 6)To Saute: for every four empanadas melt 1 TB butter in heavy skillet and saute over medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side.. To Bake: arrange the empanadas on the buttered cookie sheet, making absolutely sure they are securely closed. (If cheese creeps out during baking, it will burn.) Brush the tops lightly with melted butter, and bake at 375F for 12 to 15 minutes. Serve hot. ~-from Still Life with Menu Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #257 Date: Thu, 19 Sep 1996 19:11:02 -0700 From: Julie Bertholf &lt;jewel1@ix.netcom.com&gt;</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt chocolate. Stir till mixed and melted. Break egg into pot. Stir with spatula till mixed. Add sugar slowly stirring. When thick, roll chocolate into small balls large enough to accomodate an almond and a cherry in the center of each chocolate ball. Roll in crushed nuts, cocoa or roasted cocunut. NOTE: If you use a larger egg, you may need to alter the amount of icing sugar. Play it by ear to see. Also if the chocolate mixture appears to be thick enough and you still have sugar left - quit. To keep working quickly - have bowls of cherries, almonds, cocoa and cocounut ready. AuntiFifi (Mimi in Detroit, with whom I had a lovely phone chat when we were there) suggested keeping ice water ready to dip hands into so chocolate didn't melt when working with it.

Heat the oil in a wok. Add the paste. Stir-fry until the water content is cooked out (about 3-5 minutes) and the paste thickens and begins to bubble with the same kind of boiling noise that oatmeal makes. Remove from heat.

      <li>1) Remove bread pan; attach kneading blade. 2) Place all ingredients in bread pan in order listed. 3) Insert bread pan, close lid and plug in. 4) Select bread type: Press select until the number 8 is displayed (Sweet Bread cycle). 5) Press start. Bread will be done baking in the number of hours indicated. 6) Add mix-ins when bread machine beeps, about 32 minutes after starting. Rapid cycle not recommended. Don't use the delay bake option for this recipe. I used pecans instead of macadamia nuts &amp; it worked out ok. This recipe came right to the glass when done, but it turned out ok.

    <title>Banana-Cranberry Juice-Tofu Smoothie</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Peeled bananas; frozen or fresh, (if your bananas are giant, use one)</li>
      <li>1 Box Mori-Nu lite tofu</li>
      <li>Cranberry juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Maple syrup</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Break bananas into 3" pieces and put in blender. Add the tofu, broken up a bit. Pour cranberry juice in to almost cover. Blend, adding more juice if mixture seems too thick. Add maple syrup while blending. Vary the texture to your preference, I like it at yogurt consistency. Pour some over a cooked bowl of oatmeal and swirl in. This will make a full blender of smoothie, enough for 4-6 bowls of oatmeal. I store the leftover smoothie in a glass container in the refrigerator, where it often mysteriously disappears :-) For some reason, it tastes like a strawberry shake. You can often buy ripe bananas for very little money. I buy large quantities, peel them, break them into three pieces, and freeze them in zip loc bags. For those that have had trouble with frozen bananas in their blenders, maybe it's the blender? I bought an Oster, which was about $10 more than the others, because I wanted the glass container. This blender model seems to have a very sturdy little motor in it. Posted to fatfree digest by Anne Cox &lt;coxa@pilot.msu.edu&gt; on Feb 19, 1998</li>

Prep all vegetables according to recipe requirements. 2. For the tofu: Combine sesame oil, tamari, garlic powder, and paprika in a small mixing bowl. Place the tofu on a pan with another pan on top of the tofu (to press the tofu). Leave pressed until water is removed. When all water is removed, slice into battonettes (small baton shapes). Place tofu into marinade, then put on parchment paper and bake at 350 degrees for 17 minutes or until crispy. 3. For the millet: Bring 1-1/2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan with a pinch of sea salt. When water starts to boil add the millet and reduce heat. Cook on heat for about 5 minutes, then remove from the stove and allow mixture to steep. After 5 minutes, place in a mixing bowl and add grated onion and grated jicama to the millet. Product will be soft. Form millet into discs and place on greased parchment paper. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-25 minutes. 4. For parmesan ring: Cut parchment paper into 2-1/2 x 9-inch sheets. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray parchment with vegetable spray and graciously sprinkle parmesan cheese on the paper. Bake for 7 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the stove quickly and form ring around any size can. Size will be based upon personal preference. When ring cools remove parchment paper and product will be self standing. 5. Finally, toss salad with remaining vegetables and place in parmesan ring. Add tofu and millet discs to your plate, then drizzle 1 ounce of ponzu vinaigrette (recipe follows) over the top of the salad.

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>When bamboo is cultivated for shoots, workers walk the fields barefoot, heaping soil around those spots where their toes feel a slight rise in the ground. The bulge heralds an emerging culm, which is kept covered as long possible, sometimes with a wooden box, because when exposed it becomes fibr in a short time. The shoot is harvested when about 1 foot tall, by digging down and carefully severing it at the point where it joins the rhizome bear it. Shoots are boiled a half hour or more and the outer sheaths removed. They are white in color, with the look of a raw paotato, crisp in texture. Shoots of almost any bamboo can be eaten. The principal genera used for sprouts include Arundinaria, Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, and Phyllostachys. Although the size is one limiting factor, even diminutive Sasa in Japan provides some 600 tons of shoots annually. In Taiwan P. edulis and D. latiflorus are used. In Japan P. moso and P edu are used. Soft quality shoots require yearly soil dressing, straw litter a farmyard manure.. A sprout properly dug will have a rooty, woody basal portin, increasing sharply in diameter upwad for a short distance from the very slender part which was attached to its rhizome, and then tapering to a point. With a sharp paring knife cut lengthwise through the sheath only, from tip to base the sprout. Beginning with the lowersheaths, remove all except the tender ones at the tip. If there is a grayish layer (owing to age) next to the lo nodes, pare this off. Remove the togh basal part. Cut the core portion diagonally or crosswise into rather this slices. The lower, firmer portion should be cut across the grain, not thicker than 1/8 inch, but the more ten middle and upper parts may be sliced thicker or cut into varioyus shapes according to the recipe. Sprouts may be served alone, drained, with butter melted over them, after boiling for about twenty minutes. Salt is added ne the end of the boiling period. If the fresh sprouts are unpleasantly bitte to the taste there should be a change of water after the first ten minutes cooking. The more pronounced bitterness of some of the tropical edible bamboos (of the genus Bambusa and others) may be removed by a third change water if the bamboo is not sliced too thicvk and a good volume of water is used.</li>

It's inspired by Ben &amp; Jerry's Chunky Monkey, one of my favorite flavors, but the recipe is my own adaptation after looking at banana ice cream recipes in several cookbooks. Let me know what you think, sp that I can possibly refine it further. Peel the bananas and cut into chunks. Puree in blender with the lemon juice. Add vanilla and sugar and blend until smooth. Add milk and blend again, briefly. Add cream, blend thoroughly. Churn in ice-cream machine according to manufacturer's instructions. A few minutes before finished, add nuts and chocolate chips; continue churning. Makes 1 generous quart. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash the fresh okra under cold running water, and with a small, sharp knife, scrape the skin lightly to remove any surface fuzz. Cut 1/8 inch off the stem at the narrow end of each pod. In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, melt 2 table spoons of butter over moderate heat. When the foam subsides, add the okra and, stirring frequently, cook for about 5 minutes until it stops "roping," or producing thin white threads. with a slotted spoon, transfer the okra to paper towels to drain. Pour off the fat remaining in the skillet, add 2 more tablespoons of butter and melt it over moderate heat. Drop in the onions and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are soft and lightly browned. Add the meat, mashing it with the back of the spoon to break up any lumps, and cook until all traces of pink disappear. stir in the garlic, tomato puree, 1 cup of the stock, the salt and a few grindings of pepper. Cook briskly uncovered until most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated and the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape almost solidly in the spoon. Remove from the heat. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees (F). with a pastry brush coat the bottom and sides of a circular baking dish 7 or 8 inches in diameter and about 3 inches deep with the tablespoons of softened butter. spoon half the meat mixture into the casserole, smoothing and spreading it to the edges with a spatula. Arrange the okra over the meat, placing the pieces closely together side by side in a spoke like pattern with the cut ends facing out. Spread the remaining meat mixture evenly over the okra, masking it completely, and sprinkle over it the remaining stock. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, cover tightly with a lid or foil and bake in the middle of the oven for about 1 hour. (Check the casserole occasionally, and if the top seems dry pour in up to « cup more stock, a few tablespoons at a time.) Cook the bamia uncovered for 5 minutes, then unmold it in the following fashion: Run a long, sharp knife around the inside edges of the casserole, place a heated serving plate upside down over the top and, grasping the casserole and plate together firmly, invert them. The bamia should slide out easily. Serve garnished with lemon wedges.

When thick, roll chocolate into small balls large enough to accomodate an almond and a cherry in the center of each chocolate ball. Roll in crushed nuts, cocoa or roasted cocunut. NOTE: If you use a larger egg, you may need to alter the amount of icing sugar. Play it by ear to see. Also if the chocolate mixture appears to be thick enough and you still have sugar left - quit. To keep working quickly - have bowls of cherries, almonds, cocoa and coconut ready. You can keep a bowl of ice water ready to dip hands into so chocolate didn't melt when working with it.

      <li>From: gholman@ndirect.co.uk (Guy Holman) Date: Wed, 14 Aug 1996 12:02:45 GMT Roast the spices and allow to cool, grind to a powder, then add additional ingredients. Mix spices and place in a bowl, add 6-8 fl oz (175-250 ml) of vinegar. Mix the spice into the vinegar, adding water if needed to make a creamy paste. Let this stand for a while, 1/2 hour is best. Meanwhile heat 6-8 fl oz (175-250 ml) vegetable oil. Add paste to the oil, care is needed here as it will splatter very easily. Stir the paste for about 5 mins, do not let it stick. Remove from heat and stand for 5-10 mins, if the oil rises to the top the spices are cooked, if not add more oil and cook again for a while, don't forget to keep stiring. Bottle the paste, (sterile jars essential) and cap with hot oil. This is well worth the trouble to make and will store for a long time. It never lasts long in my house though= !!!

      <li>Date: Tue, 2 Apr 1996 09:51:49 -0500 (EST) From: Hazel Slone &lt;hslone@freenet.columbus.oh.us&gt; Recipe By: The California Culinary Academy 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Blanch onions in boiling, salted water 30 seconds; drain. Slice off the root end. "Peel" the onions by pressing them slightly between your fingers; the inner part will slip out of the papery skin. 2. Whisk together oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Put onions in a roasting pan, add oil-vinegar mixture, and toss to coat well. Bake until tender (about 25 minutes). Remove from oven and let cool in pan. Taste; adjust seasoning as necessary. 3. To serve, place 2 onions and 1 cheese cube on each cocktail skewer. Makes 24 to 30 skewers. NOTES : Tiny pearl onions turn sweet and soft when roasted with oil and vinegar, especially a vinegar as mellow and rich as Italian balsamic. The onions can be roasted a few days ahead; the cheese can be cubed and wrapped in plastic a day in advance. The cheese will cube better if cold, but both onions and cheese taste better at room temperature. MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER From the MasterCook recipe list.

      <li>Soy sauce and thinly sliced red chiles for dipping</li>
      <li>2 Chinese crullers, sliced (Optional)</li>
      <li>Steamed white rice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I think the only "Singaporean" dish I have is one for a curried noodle dish known as Singapore Noodles every where in Asian except Singapore where they never seem to have heard of it. Stay tuned though. I'll see what I can come up with. Well, it's a little later and we're in luck! I found three Singapore recipes in Joyce Jue's "Asian Appetizers". Here's da foist... Although most Asian lunches and dinners include a soup, there are certain soups which are served as a snack or even for breakfast. In Singapore, one of my favorite ways to start a day is to trek over to a hawker's stall and have a bowl of pork rib "tea" (actually a clear soup tinted with soy sauce). It comes with Chinese crullers for dunking, and a strong black tea which I think of as the "espresso" of teas. This recipe comes from the Straits Cafe in San Francisco. The crullers, baguette-shaped fried savory pastries, may be purchased at better Asian markets. 1. Combine the pork, garlic, and water in a large saucepan; bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Skim and discard the scum from the surface. Add the cinnamon, star anise, peppercorns, sugar, salt, and soy sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the pork is tender, about 45 minutes. Discard the excess fat from the soup before serving. 2. Serve the soup in deep bowls with 3 to 4 rib pieces per serving and shallot flakes scattered over the top. Combine soy sauce and chiles to taste in small bowls as a dipping sauce for the ribs. Serve with cruller slices for dunking into the broth, and a bowl of rice on the side. Makes 4 to 6 servings. CRISP FRIED SHALLOT AND GARLIC FLAKES: Cut 8 shallots or garlic cloves crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices; you should have 3/4 cup of slices. The slices must all be of equal thickness to assure even cooking. Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil to 300F in a preheated wok, saucepan, or skillet. Add the slices and fry slowly for 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. They should be completely dry with no remaining moisture. Remove with a fine strainer and drain on paper towels. When cool, store in an airtight container. The flakes will keep for several weeks. Makes about 1/2 cup. Makes about 1/2 cup. NOTE: The flavored oil can be strained and used for stir-frying.

    <ingredient>
      <li>10 cups Tomatoes; peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>5 cups Green peppers; chopped</li>
      <li>5 cups Onion; chopped</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Hot peppers; chopped</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic; minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cilantro; chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Hot pepper sauce; optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix everything together in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Ladle into hot pint canning jars, put on lids and rings and process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. Makes 6 pints. NOTES : This uses about 6 pounds tomatoes, 2 pounds green pepper and 1 1/2 pounds onion. Depending on your tastes and how hot your peppers are, you may want to use less hot pepper. 3/4 cup finely chopped jalapenos, with no hot pepper sauce added, makes a mild to medium salsa. I try to use at least half Roma tomatoes (or other paste tomatoes) to keep it from being too runny. You could also drain off some of the tomato juices before mixing everything together. The recipe says it makes 6 pints, but I've always gotten 7 or 8 pints from one recipe.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 slices French bread; dry</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk; (about)</li>
      <li>1 pound Ground sirloin</li>
      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>1 Fresh jalapeno pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil; or canola oil</li>
      <li>1 Egg; or 2 egg whites</li>
      <li>2 ounces Parmesan cheese; grated</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cilantro; chopped (about)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Canola oil for frying</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make meatballs: Soak bread in milk. Squeeze it lightly. Add to sirloin, discarding any extra milk. Chop onion fine. Using rubber gloves, wash jalapeno. Remove and discard stem. Chop extra fine. Open all windows in kitchen. Saute onion and jalapeno lightly in oil. (Note: If fumes bother you, cover pan; if they still bother you, consider mixture sauteed enough.) Cool slightly. Add to meat mixture, blending well. Beat egg lightly. Add Parmesan, cilantro, salt and black pepper. Add to meat mixture. Blend together well. Wearing rubber gloves, form meat mixture into balls, approximately 1 inch in diameter. Separate balls into 2 batches. To cook meatballs: Pour oil into cast-iron skillet so a 1/2 inch of oil covers bottom. Heat until piece of meat mixture dropped in oil sizzles. Turn heat to medium high. Fry first batch of meatballs until undersides brown. Roll them over so other side browns. Remove from oil with slotted spoon. Drain well on paper towels. Fry second batch of meatballs in same oil. Note: These mildly hot meatballs make excellent appetizers (best if served within two hours of cooking) and may be served with Sizzling Salsa as a dip , or with homemade or canned spaghetti sauce as an entree. To make them zippier, add another jalapeno. Note for me: fairly mild - add more jalapeno. Tasty. _From by Susan Hazen-Hammond and Eduardo Fuss.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pints Strawberries</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Sugar; (4 to 6)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Balsamic vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is an exquisite dish created by the talented Mollie Katzen. She advises the use of perfectlyRipe berries to maximize the effects of this traditional Italian treat. Please note that the berries may be sliced and sugared up to a day in advance. However the vinegar should be applied within 30 minutes of serving. 1. Clean the strawberries by wiping them with a damp paper towel. Avoid washing them directly in water as this dilutes the flavor of the berries by ab- sorbtion. 2. Hull the strawberries, and halve or slice them. This would depend on their size. Place the berries on a shallow pan (10-inch pie pan) and sprinkle with sugar. 3. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to sit for several hours, shaking the pan every so often. If you plan you plan on letting then sit for more than 3 1/2 hours, they will have to beRefrigerated. 4. Sprinkle with vinegar within a half hour of serving atRoom temperature. .</li>

      <li>1 2 tomatoes, chopped (or one</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash the chard and chop or tear into peices, discarding tough stems. Saute tomatoes over medium heat in large skillet until cooked to desired consistancy, 5-15 min. (I like mine on the soft side). Add vinegar, chard and water if needed. Cover and steam vegetables until cooked to desired doneness, 5-15 min. Check occasionally to be sure there is enough water in the pan. Cooking time for tomatoes and greens depends on how tough the greens are, smaller, younger leaves will be more tender; and how well cooked you like the vegetables.

      <li>In a large saucepan cover beets with salted water by 1 inch. Simmer beets, covered, 35 to 45 minutes, or until tender, and drain in a colander. Cool beets until they can be handled and slip off skins and stems. Cut beets lengthwise into wedges. Beets may be prepared up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring beets to room temperature before proceeding. In a large skillet stir together vinegar, syrup or honey, and oil and add beets. Cook beet mixture with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until heated through and coated well. Sprinkle about half of thyme over beets and toss gently. Serve beets sprinkled with remaining thyme.

    <title>Baklava</title>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>500 grams Strudel dough; (or fillo leaves)</li>
      <li>500 grams Unsalted butter; well melted. Salted</li>
      <li>500 grams Walnut meat; chopped medium fine</li>
      <li>50 grams Sugar</li>
      <li>5 mililiters Vanilla; (or use vanilla sugar)</li>
      <li>1 liter Sugar</li>
      <li>500 mililiters Water</li>
      <li>5 mililiters Lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Heat oven to 150 øC to 160 øC . 2. Make the syrup first. Boil the water and sugar for 15 minutes. Add lemon juice, boil 10 more minutes, set aside to cool. 3. Make the filling: Mix all ingredients well. I prefer the walnuts fairly coarse; some people like them quite fine. 4. Cut the dough with scissors to the size of the tray. Handle the dough very carefully; do not press hard on it at any time. Cover with wax paper and damp towel. 5. Take out one sheet of dough at a time and place it in the pan. Brush the dough with melted butter between each layer. Continue until you have about 12 sheets buttered. Small and broken pieces of dough can be used in the center, but there must be butter between every two layers. 6. Spread walnut filling across the tray. 7. Put on a sheet of dough, brush on butter, and continue until all the dough is used up. 8. Cut into diamond shapes: cut into quarters with cuts parallel to the long axis, then cut diagonally across. Don't press hard! 9. Bake for about 1 1/2 hour, until golden brown. Be careful not to burn the bottom or the walnuts, especially with a glass pan. 10. Let cool on rack for 5 minutes. Add syrup which should have cooled to room temperature. Let cool for at least two hours before eating. Author's Notes: Baklava is claimed by almost every Balkan state as its own invention; most people in the United States first encounter it in Greek restaurants. If the truth were known, it's probably the Turkish who invented it, as is the case for many other ``typically Greek'' dishes. This recipe comes from my Bulgarian grandmother, and follows Bulgarian tradition, in that the filling is very simple. Probably the hardest thing about this recipe is waiting those last two hours! Depending on where you go, you'll hear the name of this dish pronounced different ways. I pronounce the name with all /ah/ sounds, with accents of equal intensity on both the first and third syllable. The second syllable is quite faint. Greek-speaking persons typically put a heavy accent on the second syllable. Many variations on the filling are to be found. A simple one was mentioned above, regarding the coarseness of grind of the walnuts in the filling. They may even be ground. Spices such as chopped cloves or cinnamon may be added, and the filling may be included in several layers instead of just one. A large pan is almost too big to handle. I typically make this recipe in two pans, which is just about the size of a half sheet of the dough I buy. By the way, if you can make your own strudel dough, it will be even better ... but much more effort. It is best to have a partner help you prepare the pans. One person handles the dough and places it in the pan, while the other applies the butter. It is very important that sufficient butter be placed between layers so that each layer gets flaky, rather than having them stick together. Pay particular attention to the edges and corners. In case you haven't noticed, this is very sweet stuff. It goes great with a fine cup of coffee, espresso, or Turkish coffee, even with sugar. Two pieces will probably fill anyone up; it refrigerates and freezes quite well. This recipe requires a lot of effort, but it's well worth it. Difficulty : moderate to hard. Precision : measure the ingredients.

      <li>This recipe calls for slightly underripe bananas because, as they cook, they'll soften up quite a bit. Lime juice keeps the bananas from discoloring, so they are easily made ahead through step 3. The sweet and tangy combination is just right served after your jazzy meal. 1. Preheat oven to 375'F. 2. Butter a shallow baking dish; reserve remaining butter. 3. Peel and layer bananas in the buttered dish and drizzle with lime juice. 4. Sprinkle with sugar and dot bananas with remaining butter. Bake for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with sauce. Remove bananas from dish carefully with a long spatula. Serve hot, with sauce spooned on top.

      <li>From: Iain G Liddell &lt;Iain.Liddell@brunel.ac.uk&gt; Date: Tue, 18 Jan 1994 09:54:44 +0000 (GMT) Scottish Shortbread: As far as shortbread is concerned, I'm a great believer in simplicity. The recipe for Balmoral Shortbread below is typical of this style. However, with Scots cookery, one should never ignore Mistress Margaret (Meg) Dods. Her "Cook's and Housewife's Manual" was promoted (ghosted?) by Sir Walter Scott, who coined her pseudonym. The recipe for Petticoat Tails is described by Catherine Brown (Scottish Regional Recipes) as "a ladies' shortbread - men generally prefer thick fingers". Other recipes call for additions such as rice flour, cornflour (cornstarch), lemon peel, ground or slivered almonds (or almond essence) but these are all just curlicues. As for the commercially produced Choc Chip Shortbread and Cherry Shortbread ... they are about as Scots as the Taj Mahal. Note the 3:2:1 ratio - what could be simpler. Preheat oven to 350F / 180C / Gas 4 Sift flour onto a board. Put sugar in a separate pile on the board, and work in butter. Gradually knead in flour: you should end up with a firm dough. Flour the board and roll to a thickness of 3mm to 5mm. Cut into circles and prick with a fork. Bake on a greased tray for 30 minutes.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 can (14 1/2 oz.) ready-to-serve fat-free chicken broth with 1/3 less sodium</li>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry pack sun-dried tomatoes, cut up</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups Uncooked couscous</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped green onions</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Chopped fresh basil (or 4 teaspoons dried basil leaves)</li>
      <li>1 Jar (5 3/4 oz.) sliced green olives, drained (about 1 1/4 cups)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Prep time: 30 minutes 1. In medium saucepan, combine broth, 2 cups water and sun-dried tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Stir in couscous; remove from heat. Cover; let stand 5 minutes. 2. Line 1 large or 2 small cookies sheets with waxed paper. To cool couscous mixture quickly, fluff with fork; spread on lined cookie sheet. Let stand 5 minutes. 3. In large bowl, combine cooled couscous mixture, onions, basil, olives, balsamic vinegar and 2 tablespoons water; toss gently to mix well. Add oil; toss gently. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until serving time. 20 (1/2 cup) servings. Calories: 100 Calories from fat: 20 Dietary exchanges: 1 starch, 1/2 fat or 1 carbohydrate, 1/2 fat Notes: I did not bother with step two. I just poured the warm couscous into a large shallow stainless steel bowl I use for mixing/tossing big salads and let it sit there while I was washing and preparing the green onions and basil. I stirred it around a few times, and it cooled off fine. Also, I spread the green olives in a ring around the edge of my serving bowl. It looked nice, and they were easier to avoid for anyone who is not as crazy about green olives as I am. Posted to EAT-L Digest by Lynne Fraser &lt;Lynne_Fraser@BROWN.EDU&gt; on Jul 7, 1997</li>

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Beef Tenderloin</li>
      <li>Salt And Pepper; To Taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Chopped Fresh Garlic</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Balsamic Vinegar</li>
      <li>8 ounces Sliced Mushrooms</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Season entire surface of tenderloin with salt and pepper. Heat oil and garlic in oven-proof skillet or flame-proof shallow roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add meat, turning to brown all sides. Place in a 425 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until internal temperatures reaches 145 degrees for medium-rare. Remove from oven. Place meat on cutting board and cover with foil. Place pan over high heat; add vinegar and stir to remove browned bits from pan. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until reduced by half. Add mushrooms; cook for 2 minutes or until mushrooms are tender. Cut meat into 1/2-inch thick slices. Spoon mushrooms and sauce over each serving. NOTES : Start with melt-in-your-mouth medallions of beef tenderloin. Then pair them with the sweet, yet robust flavor of this classic, dark Italian vinegar, fresh mushrooms, and of course, garlic!

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Walnuts, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground Cloves</li>
      <li>Syrup:</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sugar</li>

      <li>1 Cinnamon Stick</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Lemon Juice</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Honey</li>
      <li>1 pound Phyllo Dough</li>
      <li>3/4 pounds Unsalted Butter, melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix first four ingredients together for filling. Combine syrup ingredients and cook until sugar dissolves and mixture turns syrupy. Set aside to cool. Remove cinnamon stick before using. To Assemble: Unfold phyllo. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut phyllo sheets crosswise, into thirds. Cover phyllo not being used with a barely damp towel. Using two pieces of phyllo - phyllo sheets are so thin they must be doubled - and keeping narrow ends towards you, brush with butter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons filling 1/4 inch from end nearest you, to within 1/4 inch of sides. Fold long sides in 1/4 inch. Fold over bottom to cover filling. Place a clean pencil on top of fold and roll into a cigar-like cylinder. Push both ends toward center and remove pencil. Place roll on cookie sheet and generously brush with butter. Repeat with remaining filling and phyllo. Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Dip hot rolls into cooled syrup - kitchen tongs work well for this. Place onto a platter to cool. Cover and refrigerate. Can be frozen. SOURCE: Gifts from The Kitchen SHARED BY:Jim Bodle 8/92 From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Baskets (10 ozs. each) pearl onions (about 90)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Balsamic vinegar</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>&gt; by: Laurie Souza, Franciscan Oakville Estate, New Orleans Times Picayune. Boil the onions in salted water until they are crisp-tender, 3-7 mins, depending on the size, drain. Remove and discard the papery outer skins. Do not cut off much of the root end or the onion will fall apart. Heat a saute pan, large enough to hold all the onions in one layer, over medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil. When oil is rippling, add onions, shaking pan until all are well-coated with oil. Add one tabsp plus one teasp of the vinegar. Continue to saute, shaking pan occasionally, until the onions are golden brown, 6-8 mins. When they are golden, sprinkle in the remaining two teasp balsamic vinegar; season with the fresh ground pepper to taste. Shake the pan briefly to distribute the vinegar. Taste for seasoning and add a dash more vinegar if desired, but there should be just a hint of it.

    <quantity>36</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Shelled walnuts; 2 cups, 2 pounds unshelled</li>
      <li>1 pound Blanched almonds</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground allspice</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 pound Unsalted butter; melted and cooled</li>
      <li>1 pound Filo dough; * see note</li>
      <li>36 Whole cloves</li>
      <li>Sugar syrup; see recipe</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coarsely grind (or finely chop) walnuts and almonds; place in a mixing bowl. Add cinnamon, allspice, and sugar; mix thoroughly. Brush a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Unfold filo dough so it lays flat, then cover to prevent it from drying out. Line dish with 10 to 12 filo sheets, brushing each with melted butter before adding the next sheet. Spread a thin layer of the nut mixture over the filo, cover with a filo sheet, brush with butter, and cover with another thin layer of the nut mixture. Repeat process until all of the nut mixture is used. Then cover with the remaining filo sheets, brushing each with butter as you layer it in the dish. Brush top sheet lavishly with butter. With a very sharp knife or single-edged razor blade, cut diagonally across the pan to make small diamonds, going only deep enough to reach through the unfilled top filo layers. Insert a clove up to base of bud in center of each triangle. Bake until evenly browned and crispy (about 1[1/2] hours). Meanwhile, prepare syrup and set aside to cool. Remove pastry from oven, cool slightly, and pour cooled syrup evenly over the top; it should penetrate all of the layers. Cool several hours or overnight. Serving Ideas : Finish cutting through the filo layers to serve. NOTES : Thawed in refrigerator overnight if frozen. Yield: 3 dozen diamonds.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the first seven ingredients to make the marinade (mix them well). Marinate the chicken breasts for 1 - 2 hours (marinate longer if you want the chicken to be more flavorful). Broil chicken breast until cooked through, then shred or cut into bite-sized pieces. Combine cooked chicken with leftover marinade and cooked penne. Heat everything through thoroughly (the remaining marinade must be cooked because there was raw chicken sitting in it). Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.

      <li>1 pound Filo dough</li>
      <li>1 cup Butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Prepare syrup first: bring to boil 2-1/2 cups sugar and water; add lemon juice. Simmer until it is a pale yellow color. Syrup should be thick and cold when poured over hot Baklava. Mix nuts, 1/4 cup sugar, and spices; set aside. Butter 9" x 13" cake pan thoroughly. Keep filo pastry covered with a damp tea towel while working with individual sheets. Layer sheets in baking pan, one at a time, brushing each layer with melted butter. After layering six or so, begin alternating layers of filo pastry with nut mixture. Brush one layer with butter and sprinkle the next with 1/2 cup nut mixture. Continue to alternate buttered layers and nut-covered layers until all but ten of the sheets have been used. Layer the last ten sheets as you did the bottom six, brushing each with butter. Bake at 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let cool for five minutes. Score pastry into diamond shapes about 1-1/2" X 2". Pour cold syrup over hot pastry. Allow to cool to room temperature before cutting and removing from pan.

Fry the onions in the oil until all the water have gone. Add the prawns, masala, curry leaves, garlic, ginger and green chillies. Simmer for 10 minutes or so.

      <li>1 dash Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 pound Phyllo pastry sheets</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sweet butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note: Either toasted blanched almonds, or walnut meats, or half of each, (finely chopped) may be used. Cooky Filling: Cream the 2 cups sweet butter until light. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until mixture is fluffy. Add egg yolk and vanilla or almond extract and blend well. Work in about 4 cups flour to make a medium-soft dough. Set aside and make syrup. Syrup: In a saucepan combine the granulated sugar and water. Bring to a boil and boil for 15 minutes or until syrup is slightly thick. Add honey and again bring to the boiling point. Add lemon juice to taste, and cool. Mix almonds or walnuts, or a combination of the two, with zwieback, 4 T granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Brush 2 sheets of phyllo pastry evenly with butter and sprinkle with nut mixture. Place 2 buttered sheets of phyllo on top and sprinkle with nut mixture. Shape a portion of cooky filling into a 1/2-inch-thick roll and place the roll along one edge of the pastry sheets. Roll up loosely, cut into 2-inch slices, and place slices in a buttered cake pan. (Continue in this method until all phyllo pastry and/or cooky filling is used.) Brush tops of each slice with butter and bake in a 350 F oven for 20 minutes or until lightly browned. Dip the hot baklava slices, one at a time, in cold syrup, allowing each piece to remain in the syrup for a few minutes.

Gradually mix in honey, then lemon juice &amp; vanilla. Beat in eggs 1 at a time until just incorporated. Set aside. Stir through filling &amp; pour into crust. Cover filling with overhanging phyllo, squaring at edge of pan. Bake until pastry is light brown and cake is firm to touch, about 50 mins. Remove pan sides; using toothpick, poke 12 holes in top of cake to allow steam to escape. Cool completely on rack. Refrigerate 2 days to mellow flavors, covering after first day. Baklava Topping: Preheat oven to 350. Cover baking sheet with 2 pieces of parchment. Coarsely grind all nuts with 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon in processor. Stack 10 reserved phyllo pastry sheets on work surface. Set rim of 10-inch springform pan atop pastry. Cut around inside of rim through entire stack using sharp knife, making 10 rounds. Cover rounds with damp towel. Set pan rim on prepared baking sheet. Brush parchment and inside of pan rim with butter. Place one pastry round in pan rim and brush with butter. Repeat with four more rounds. Spread nut mixture evenly over pastry. Top with remaining 5 pastry rounds, brushing each with butter. Using ruler as guide, cut pastry into 16 wedges (or however many pieces you want) with sharp knife. Sprinkle lightly with water. Bake until crisp and golden, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1/2 cup sugar, water, and lemon juice in heavy small saucepan over low heat, swirling pan occasionally until sugar dissolves. Add cinnamon stick, increase heat to medium and boil until syrupy, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. When bubbles subside, add Cognac. Flatten pastry atop cake. Remove pan rim from topping. Set topping on cake, using large spatula. Re-cut wedges. Replace pan rim on assembled cake. Immediately pour on hot syrup. Cool one hour. Refrigerate one to 6 hours, preferably six hours. Let cake stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

NOTES : From: Indonesian Cuisine by Haryati Zucchi Posted by Joell Abbott 6/94 " the classical Javanese sauce, Bali, is used to flavor many main ingredients... This sauce is probably as old as Javanese culture itself.* In fact the sauce is produced by simple flavorings, such as ripe chilies, and tomato which give the sauce its blazing red colour, then spiced with scented lemon grass and ginger; a small amount of coconut cream &amp; sugar is added to give a delicate flavour to the dish." H. Zucchi, 1989 *(As chilies all originate from New World plants, this is the statement of someone simply proud of her heritage and not a scholar of foods. Javanese culture goes far back beyond the trading days of the 16&amp;1700's) Recipe by: Indonesian Cuisine by Haryati Zucchi Posted to recipelu-digest by "Christopher E.

    <title>Balsamic Roasted Chicken with Peppers and Onions</title>
    <category>None</category>

      <li>1 teaspoon Salt; divided</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Freshly ground pepper; divided</li>
      <li>3 pounds Green; red and yellow peppers, cut into 1-inch strips</li>
      <li>5 medium Onions; (1 1/2 lbs.), quartered</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Chicken broth</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Rosemary; crushed</li>
      <li>Fresh rosemary sprigs; for garnish</li>
      <li>Cooked jasmine; basmati or long-grain rice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Don't let the amount of balsamic vinegar throw you: Its mild acidity, combined with the pan drippings from the roasted chicken, give this dish a wonderfully rich and mellow flavor. To save fat grams, discard the skin. Prep time: 25 minutes Roasting time: 60 to 65 minutes Degree of difficulty: easy 1. Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Heat oven to 475°F. 2. Arrange chicken in 11x17-inch roasting pan; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Toss peppers and onions with oil in 15 1/2x10 1/2-inch jelly-roll pan; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining pepper. 3. Roast chicken on upper rack. After 10 minutes, place peppers and onions on lower rack. Roast both for 30 minutes. 4. Remove chicken from oven; transfer to plate. Stir peppers and onions; roast 10 to 20 minutes more until browned and caramelized. 5. Meanwhile, transfer pan drippings from roasting pan into a large glass measure; skim off fat. Stir in chicken broth, vinegar, garlic, oregano, rosemary and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Return chicken to pan. Spoon pan-drippings mixture over chicken; return to oven and roast 20 to 25 minutes more, basting once after 10 minutes. 6. Transfer vegetables to serving platter; cover and keep warm. (Vegetables roast a total of 40 to 50 minutes.) When chicken is cooked through, arrange on platter. (Chicken cooks a total of 60 to 65 minutes.) Spoon 1/4 cup sauce if desired over top. To serve, pass remaining sauce. Garnish with rosemary and serve with rice, if desired. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

    <title>Baklawa 'be'aj'</title>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>40</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 pound Phyllo dough sheets</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Unsalted butter; melted</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped pistachio nuts, opt.</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: NUT FILLING</li>
      <li>2 Egg whites</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Caster sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups Coarsely ground walnuts</li>
      <li>2 cups Coarsely ground almonds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Rose water</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: ALTAR SYRUP</li>
      <li>2 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Orange flower water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Rose water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Stack 10 sheets phyllo on a flat surface, keeping remainder covered with a dry, then a damp tea towel. Brush top sheet of stack with butter, lift sheet and replace on stack buttered side down. Brush top with butter, lift top two sheets and turn over on stack. Repeat until all 10 sheets are buttered, lifting an extra sheet each time. Top and bottom of finished stack should remain unbuttered. With kitchen scissors cut buttered stack of phyllo into approximately 10 cm (4 inches) squares. Stack and cover. Prepare remainder of phyllo. Depending on size of phyllo sheets, you may have fewer than 10 left at the end. Halve sheets if necessary to give 10 layers. Beat egg whites until stiff and beat sugar in gradually. Fold in nuts and rose water. Butter top of phyllo square and place a tablespoonful of nut mixture in the centre. Gently squeeze into a lily shape, with four corners of square as petals and filling in centre. Place in a buttered 25 x 33 cm (10 x 13 inch) baking dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients, placing finished pastries close together in dish. Bake in moderate oven for 30 minutes, reduce to slow and cook for further 15 minutes. Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over heat, add lemon juice and orange water and bring to the boil. Boil for 15 minutes, stir in rose water and cool. Spoon cool thick syrup over hot pastries. Leave until cool and sprinkle pistachio nuts in centres of pastries if desired. Note: If you are not used to working with phyllo pastry, then it is advisable to fill and shape the first lot of buttered squares before going onto the nest lot. The butter firms fairly quickly and it could be difficult to shape the pastries if the buttered sheets are left for a time. * From: The Complete Middle East Cookbook by Tess Mallos. * ISBN: 1 86302 069 1. * Typed for you by Karen Mintzias Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #213 by Lea Faulkner &lt;lea@scott.net&gt; on Aug 14, 1997</li>

    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>24</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 cups Walnuts; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 pound Phyllo Dough; *see note</li>
      <li>1 cup Butter; melted (2 sticks)</li>
      <li>1 12-Oz Jar Honey</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Beverly R. Salinger *Note: Phyllo dough can be bought pre-packaged in your frozen dessert section of the grocery store. This is the trickiest part of making Baclava, keeping the layers from drying out: 1). Keep dough under a clean, moist kitchen towel to prevent drying as you work with it. Trim it to fit your baking dish, overlapping smaller pieces. 2). Once assembled, cut thru the top 1/2 of the layers BEFORE baking to make cutting easier upon completion. 3). Spoon on the hot honey while the dessert is still hot so they can be absorbed into the layers as they cool. DIRECTIONS: Grease a 13" x 9" baking dish. In a large bowl with a spoon, mix chopped wanuts, sugar, cinammon until blended. Cut phyllo into 13 x 9" rectangles. In a baking dish, place one sheet of phyllo; brush with butter. Repeat with 5 more layers, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle with one cup of nut mixture. Place one sheet of phyllo over the nut mixture, brush with butter. Repeat with at least 6 layers, overlapping if necessary. Sprinkle with 1 cup nut mixture. Repeat layering two more times. Place remaining phyllo on top of last walnut layer; brush with butter. With a sharp knife, cut 1/2-way thru the layers in triangle patterns to make 24 servings (make 12 squares, then cut them in half diagonally). Bake in 300 oven until golden brown, about 1 hour, 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium heat, heat honey until hot but not boiling. Spoon honey over baklava. Cool in pan at least one hour and then cut thru remaining layers and serve. Per serving: 255 cals. I don't want to know fat grams! THIS IS VERY RICH!!!!!

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 pounds Lamb shoulder with bones; cut in chunks</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions; peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>3 large Bell peppers; trimmed and seeded</li>
      <li>12 small Red new potatoes; scrubbed and eyes removed</li>
      <li>2 large Tomatoes; cut into eighths</li>
      <li>1 bunch Green onions and tops; roots trimmed &amp; sliced into 1 1/2" lengths</li>
      <li>8 Cloves garlic; crushed and peeled</li>
      <li>1 cup Snipped fresh dill or 3 tablespoons dried dill</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Hot Hungarian paprika; or to taste or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Water</li>
      <li>3 Yellow summer squash or yellow zucchini; ends trimmed and thickly sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Green beans; ends trimmed and cut in 1 1/2" lengths</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Lemon juice; or to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350. Place lamb in a large (6-quart or more) ovenproof casserole or Dutch oven and add onion, bell pepper, potatoes, tomatoes, green onion, garlic, dill, paprika, salt, and black pepper.Pour on olive oil and then the water. Cover and bake 2 1/2 hours.Scatter squash and green beans on top of other ingredients and add a little more water (about half a cup) if the stew looks dry. Bake 30 minutes longer. Remove casserole from oven, leaving oven turned on if serving stew the same night. Pour off (or tilt casserole and spoon off) most of the liquid into a bowl. To liquid add lemon juice, tasting carefully and correcting seasonings. NOTES : To serve the same night, spoon off all visible fat from liquid or, better yet, place bowl in freezer until fat congeals on top (about 20 minutes).To serve the next day, refrigerate liquid separately from remaining ingredients. Remove and discard fat from top of liquid. Whichever technique is used, before serving pour remaining degreased liquid back into casserole. Cover casserole and reheat in oven until liquid is bubbling slightly (about 20 minutes if chilled, 5 minutes if unchilled). Serve in large soup bowls with French bread on the side or on large plates over a bed of Pilaf. For a thicker, creamy sauce, stir 3/4 cup yogurt into liquid just before reheating. Yield: 4 servings.

      <li>2 tablespoons Lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 F after the filling has been prepared. Divide the pastry into 2-equal parts. Lay 1 sheet on a well-buttered 11 x 16 inch baking pan. Brush surface generously with melted butter. Lay second sheet on top of first and butter. Repeat until half of the pastry sheets have been used. Cover unused half of pastry sheets with a kitchen cloth to prevent drying. Prepare the filling: Over medium heat bring milk, sugar and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add farina by sprinkling in a little at a time, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and the farina is well cooked. Spread the hot farina mixture evenly over the entire surface of pastry sheets. Again build up the remaining half of the pastry sheets, buttering each surface generously, on top of farina. Pour the remaining butter over the top. Cut pastry sheets into 24 equal squares. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until light golden. While the baklava is cooking prepare syrup: Place sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes without stirring. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Remove baklava from oven. Pour off all excess butter by tilting the pan. Cook for 10 minutes. Brush surface lightly with some of the drained butter to give luster to the pastry. Pour syrup over a little at a time, until all is absorbed. Allow to cool for several hours.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Cipolline or small (1 1/2") onions</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sweet butter</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Chopped fresh rosemary leaves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel the onions, leaving and washing any root strand you may find. In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan over a medium high flame, heat virgin olive oil until just smoking. Add butter and cook until foam subsides. Add onions and saute until light golden brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add sugar, vinegar, tomato sauce and water and bring to a boil. Cook onions uncovered, until just al dente, about 10 minutes. If liquid dissipates too quickly, add more water, a 1/4 cup at a time, realizing that it is essential not to overcook the onions. The sauce should just adhere to the onions. Remove from saute pan to an earthenware dish and hold in a warm place, or allow to cool if you are serving them later or as an antipasto.

      <li>1/4 cups Balsamic vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F. Remove the outermost layer of onion skin, spray the onions with cooking spray, and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Place the onions close together in a baking dish and roast, uncovered, about 1 1/2 hours, until tender when pricked with a fork. (The onions will release their juices while roasting and should be soft but not mushy.) Remove the onions from the pan and set aside. Add the water to the baking dish and stir to loosen and collect the pan juices; transfer to a small saucepan. Add the vinegar and cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, reducing the mixture to about 1/4 cup syrup. Cut the onions in half lengthwise and brush the cut surface generously with the syrup, allowing it to sink down into the layers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste and serve.

      <li>3 Ripe bananas, cut into; 1/3-inch slices</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees. In large bowl sift together flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and baking powder. In separate bowl whisk together egg, buttermilk, milk and melted butter. Slowly combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. Stir until the flour disappears, but being careful not to overbeat the batter. In a large cast-iron skillet, melt about 1/2 tablespoon remaining butter. Ladle about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan for each pancake. Immediately press 4 or 5 banana slices into each so the batter oozes slightly over the fruit. Cook until bubbles appear and then flip and cook on the other side, about 3 minutes total. Transfer the pancakes to a platter and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining batches, adding butter to the pan as needed. Serve hot with syrup.

    <title>Banana/pineapple Tropical Sorbet</title>
    <category>Low-fat</category>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Pineapple</li>
      <li>2 Chopped bananas</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Plain nonfat yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Honey</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Because this sorbet is frozen in the pineapple shell, you must cut out the flesh according to the following special method. First, slice off the top, just at the point where the edges begin to straighten. Now stand the pineapple up on its bottom end. Insert a long, thin-bladed knife into the exposed flesh, next to the pineapple's outer skin. Push the knife in tin the entire length of the pineapple, stopping just above the bottom - CAREFUL - you don't want to penetrate through the bottom. Cut in a circle around the edge just inside the skin. You've now created a long cylinder of pineapple flesh that's connected to the shell only at the bottom. To separate the bottom of this fruit cylinder, insert the knife into the side of the pineapple, about 1 inch from the bottom. Without enlarging the hole that is the knife's entry point into the fruit, fan the blade back and forth, cutting through the inside fruit cylinder in a large "V". Repeat this procedure on the opposite side. Now the long, central p pineapple cylinder is free. Invert the pineapple over a bowl to catch the juice. Plunge a fork into the pineapple cylinder's top end and, with firm determination, pull it out into the bowl. Remove the tough central core of the fruit by cutting the cylinder into quarters and then trimming off the center strip of eac each piece. Remove any "eyes". Roughly chop the remaining pineapple flesh and put it into the bowl with the reserved juice. The rest is easier!! Puree pineapple flesh and juice with bananas in food processor, gradually adding the sugar, yogurt and honey. Transfer to ice cream maker and process according to directions. Scoop sorbet into hollowed out pineapple shell, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least an hour. To serve: Remove from freezer just before serving. Slice the pineapple from top to bottom into 6 wedges. Of course, one needn't go to all that trouble...but it's a lovely way to present the sorbet. If you don't want to do it, then skip all the hard part, and just chop up the pineapple flesh and go from there and serve directly out of the ice cream maker!! :) This will also get posted in the low fat topic, as it only has 1 gm of fat per serving.....

      <li>From: IWarfield2@aol.com Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 00:30:02 -0400 Place ripe bananas, 1 per serving, directly into the freezer unpeeled. The peel will serve as a protection in the freezer. Freeze solid. Just before serving, peel off the skin with a small paring knife ( a little trickier than it sounds), cut the banana into chunks &amp; place in a blender or in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Blend until the banana breaks up, passes the icy stage &amp; becomes creamy &amp; whipped with air. The consistency should be that of frozen custard. Serve immediately. Notes: Variation: Frozen berries, peaches etc. can be added, but for best results it should be at least half banana.

    <title>Banana Shortcake</title>
    <category>Cakes</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 To 1 ripe banana</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon To 2 ts lemon juice OR a pinch of unbuffered, corn-free vitamin C</li>
      <li>Crystals, to taste, optional</li>
      <li>2 slices Buckwheat Banana Bread (see recipe)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Servings: 1 This Banana Shortcake makes a satisfying, whole breakfast - it's not a dessert shortcake. Because the Banana Bread is made in advance - and probably frozen ~ the shortcake is quick and easy to put together. I (Marjorie Hurt Jones) sometimes serve it for "normal eating" house guests who devour every last crumb! Directions: Mash banana with a fork; whip until light and frothy. If you enjoy a little tang, add the lemon juice or the pinch of the vit C. Toast the bread lightly either in a toasster oven or in a dry frypan - homemade quickbreads don't do well in a traditional pop-up toasster. To assemble: Lay toasted bread on a plate; top with a dollop of masshed banana. Note: If your Banana Bread is frozen be sure to take it out the evening before you want it for breakfast. Use a serrated bread knife for slicing.

      <li>1. In large bowl, mix 4 dry ingredients and make well in centre. 2. In separate bowl, beat eggs, then mix in butter and milk. Pour into flour mixture and stir to moisten (don't worry about lumps). Add more milk or flour to make thinner or thicker pancakes. Fold in banana. 3. Drop by tbsp on oiled 380F (190C) pan, hot enough that water droplets bounce. Bananas will turn brown as pancakes cool, but will not affect taste. Do not freze. My notes: These are wonderful and the banana taste comes through well. Do not make too large or overcook.

      <li>A good friend of mine who is currently diet conscious and trying to be into low fat etc. gave me this fine concoction. It is really quite good, and easy to prepare. Good for a quick snack, or dribble syrup on it for breakfast. Try it, you’ll like it. Drop 4 inch size pancakes (about half of a 1/4 cup measuring cup) into Pam sprayed or tefal skillet and cook until puffed, and little bubbles appear and pop open all over the top. Turn only once. You can gauge the doneness when you turn the first one, it should be nice and golden brown. Lift and peek under the bottom side a couple of minutes after you turn one over and you will know better when to take them up. Can be frozen, and reheated in microwave or mini-toaster oven, or in toaster. Excellent. Posted to TNT - Prodigy's Recipe Exchange Newsletter by CHEBECK@aol.com on Sep 18, 1997</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Very ripe medium bananas; cut 1-inch chunks</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Poire William</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 Eggs; separated, at room t</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Teaspoons sugar (+2tsp)</li>
      <li>1 Pn cream of tartar Garnish--</li>
      <li>Fresh raspberry puree; strained</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spray four 1 1/2 cup souffle dishes with nonstick cooking spray. In a food processor, puree the bananas with the lemon juice, Poire William and vanilla until smooth. Add the egg yolks and 1 teaspoon of the sugar; process to blend thoroughly. Scrape the banana base into a medium bowl. In a mixer bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar at high speed until stiff peaks form. With the mixer on, sprinkle on the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and continue beating until the whites are glossy. Fold the egg whites into the banana base. Spoon into the prepared dishes; the mixture will mount to the top. Run your thumb around the inside rims to form a 1/4-inch groove in the mixture; this will help the souffles rise evenly. Set the dishes on a baking sheet and bake for 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to 425 degrees and bake for 7 minutes longer, or until puffed and browned. Spoon a little raspberry sauce on top and serve immediately.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sprinkle wafer crumbs over bottom of an 8-inch springform pan coated with vegetable cooking spray. Beat cream cheese at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy; gradually add sugar, beating well. Add egg substitute and egg whites, beating until blended. Add sour cream and next 3 ingredients, beating at low speed just until blended. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 300° for 50 to 55 minutes. (Center will be soft but will firm when chilled.) Turn off oven; partially open oven door. Leave cheesecake in oven 20 minutes. Remove to a wire rack, and run a knife around edge of pan. Cool in pan on wire rack. Cover cheesecake, and chill 8 hours. Remove sides of pan. Toss banana with lemon juice; arrange on top of cake. Pipe or spoon whipped topping around edge, and insert wafer halves into topping. Makes 12 servings. Notes: The number of fat grams in this recipe is a little high, but our rich, creamy cheesecake is worth the splurge.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Stephen Ceideburg</li>
      <li>4 large Bananas</li>
      <li>200 grams Caster sugar</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Mandarine juice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons White rum</li>
      <li>4 Eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>210 mililiters Mandarine juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Loosely related to a dessert from the English-speaking islands of the West Indies, this makes a wonderful - and legal - winter fruit pudding. Despite its richness, it has next to no fat and, if you use eggs modified with omega 3 oil, it couldn't be more nutritionally sound. Mash 4 large bananas (if anything, slightly overripe) with 200 g caster sugar, 6 tablespoons mandarin juice and 3 tablespoons white rum. Separate 4 eggs and beat the whites with a pinch of salt until they stand in stiff peaks. Fold the whites through the banana mixture gently and turn the mixture into a serving dish or dishes. Chill for several hours until set. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with 3 tablespoons of sugar until thick and creamy. Tip the mixture into the top of a double boiler or a basin over simmering water, add 210 mL of mandarine juice and whisk over a gentle heat until it reaches coating consistency. Don't let it boil. Chill for several hours. Serve with the pudding. Posted by Stephen Ceideburg From an article by Meryl Constance in the Sydney Morning Herald, 6/29/93. Courtesy, Mark Herron.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>As requested by those attending the DC Qfest .... The "Banana Salad" My wife's recipe is simular to the one in Smoke &amp; Spice, page 346. although she did not get hers from the book, it used to be her grandmothers. Serves six. In a small, heavy sauce pan, combine the sugar, egg yolk, and vinegar. Warm over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar disolves and the mixture thickens. Remove the heat and mix in the Miracle Whip. Combine the bananas and peanuts in a large bowl. Spoon the dressing over the salad and mix well. Top with additional peanuts if you wish. The salad is best eaten within a couple of hours. My wife always makes up a big batch of dressing and uses what she wants for a given salad and stores the left over dressing in the refrigerator. It will hold good for one or two weeks. If you can keep the kids out of it, it may last a day or two. When traveling she takes the dressing (in a cooler), nuts and bananas with her and mixes it up just before eating. It take no time to make the salad. Ummmmm good too. Posted to bbq-digest by "Roy A.

      <li>Alex requested a Banana Pancakes recipe. We have these all the time. Any basic pancake recipe will do with "some mashed banana" added. I ususally use Bisquick because we like it. For 2 cups of Bisquick I use 1 small banana. But here is a basic (scratch) recipe: Combine flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Set aside. Combine egg, milk and oil. Add to dry ingredients. Add mashed banana. NOTE: The quantitly of banana can vary greatly. (A fork works nicely but I use a manual baby food grinder for more even consistency.) When using very ripe bananas, less banana can be used. Experiment with quantity to see what you like ! WEILER@NETAXS.COM (WARREN WEILER) REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>1/4 cups Shredded coconut meat</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Blueberries</li>
      <li>1 Kiwi fruit</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Purchase a large angel food cake, or use a homemade one. Starting 1 inch down from top, slice the top from cake. Lay aside to use later. Using a serrated knife and a spoon, cut out the inside of the cake, leaving a wall around all sides. Do not cut through to bottom. You will be using the cavity for the filling. FILLING: Whip the cream and the confectioner's sugar until slightly stiff peaks form. Using half the cream, gently fold in the fruit and coconut, leaving out a few blueberries and the kiwi fruit for the top. Stuff the cavity with this fruit filling. Replace the top you earlier cut away. Spread the remaining whipped cream on top and sides of cake; sprinkle a few blueberries around and decorate with overlapping slices of the thinly cut kiwi fruit. Decorate with any other fruit you prefer, and chill for a minimum of 4 hours.

    <title>Amateur Lasagna</title>
    <category>Casseroles</category>
    <category>Pasta</category>
    <quantity>10</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>10 ounces Frozen spinach</li>
      <li>60 ounces Spaghetti sauce; two 30 oz. jars</li>
      <li>2 cups Ricotta cheese; part skim milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Mozzarella cheese; part skim milk, shredded</li>
      <li>1 Egg; beaten</li>
      <li>8 ounces Lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Oregano; optional</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Basil; optional</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Vegetable juice cocktail</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Spaghetti sauce is available in a 30 ounce jar and also in smaller containers. For this recipe, I use about 1-1/2 to 2 jars of the Ragu Sauce in the 30 ounce container. 1. Thaw the spinach and squeeze dry. 2. In a large container mix the two cheeses, beaten egg, black pepper, oregano and basil. Add the thawed spinach and blend well. 3. Use a 13 x 9 inch pan. Put a small amount of the sauce in bottom and spread lightly to cover bottom. This keeps the lasagna from sticking as it cooks, and enables you to remove it easily in neat portions. 4. Place one third of the uncooked noodles, one third of the sauce and one third of the cheese-spinach mixture. Make 3 layers this way, ending with the sauce. 5. Combine the water and vegetable juice cocktail or tomato juice. Pour this carefully around the edges of the casserole, moving the noodles slightly with a spatula to get the liquid distributed evenly. Sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese if desired. 6. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour to 1 and 1/4 hours. Remove foil and continue baking for a few minutes more, until lightly browned and bubbling. 7. Let stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. This lasagna can be sliced with a flat edged spatula and lifted out in serving-sized portions. NOTES : I call this Amateur Lasagna because it does not require the noodles be cooked beforehand and uses ready-made spaghetti sauce. The addition of the spinach makes it a very nutritious dish. This freezes very well in serving sized portions, wrapped in foil; to heat, place in oven while still covered, or unwrap and heat in microwave on 30-50% power.

      <li>Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 18:45:57 -0400 From: Wendy Lockman &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt; Whilst poring over my three volume loose leaf cookbook (inhabited mainly by stuff snatched from here) I ran across the following that I though you might be interested in. I think that the caveat about fresh, young ginger root is necessary to this recipe. I don't think the older, woody stuff would work at all. Guess this originally appeared here from the heading... Using a sharp knife or a Beriner cutter,shave ginger root into paper- thin slices. In a small, airtight container, combine vinnegar, sugar and salt. Blanch ginger for 30 seconds in boiling water. Drain ginger; cool. If desired, reserve liquid for cooking purposes. Add cooled ginger to vinegar mixture; mix well. Store marinating ginger in the refrigerator. Pickled ginger can be eaten after 24 hours of marinating. It will keep several weeks. Good with either Sushi or noodles. Add marinade to salads or sauces.

      <li>This dish is known as a 'slow cook' and is prepared over wood fires in the villages. Keeping the pan covered and simmering slowly ensures that the flavors are sealed in. It is a typical method of village cooking. Marinade: 1. Mix the marinade ingredients together; pour over been, and marinate for 15 minutes. 2. Put the beef and marinade in a pan, add the water and lemongrass, and stir to mix. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat for about 1 1/2 hours. Do not uncover the pan until beef is almost tender. Shake the pan once or twice during this time. 3. When the beef is tender, add the tamarind liquid; adjust the salt if necessary. Cook the beef for 5 minutes more. Serve warm with rice and other dishes. From: THE BURMESE KITCHEN by Copeland Marks and Aung Thein, Evans and Company, Inc., New York. 1987.

      <li>Date: Mon, 11 Mar 1996 18:05:38 -0500 From: Wendy Lockman &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt; Yesterday my girlfriends and I decided to do something special for ourselves. One took all of our kids to her house to spend the day with her mother who filled them with pizza and videos videos. After going to church in the morning we sat down to what we decided was our fantasy dinner (we are all on diets of some sort) and ate what we wanted the most. We had a wonderful time. After that we went to see a male dancer revue. WOW..what a day..but I have to confess, the food was the best part for all of us. The menu for the fantasy dinner follows. It was Fantastic. Now we are back to our diets and reality. They all send a special thanks to all of you who provided these recipes. (They also told me to keep them to myself from now on.) 1. Day before serving: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In medium bowl, combine coconut, almonds and butter; mix well. Press mixture into bottom of 9-inch springform pan. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Cool. 2. In large bowl of electric mixer, at high speed, beat cream cheese, sugar, flour, orange peel and vanilla until fluffy. Beat in apricot nectar and cream of coconut. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until blended. Stir in pineapple; pour into prepared crust. Bake 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until set.

    <title>American Indian Hopi Blue Corn Mush "Savory Way"</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 quart Water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Blue cornmeal</li>
      <li>Oil; for frying</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt to taste, and whisk in the cornmeal. Lower the heat and stir the cornmeal for 10 minutes or until it tastes done. The coarser the meal, the longer it will take. Pour the cooked cereal onto a cookie sheet or into a bread pan and set it aside to cool for an hour or so or until firm. Once it has cooled, slice it into pieces for frying. Fry the slices in butter or oil in a nonstick pan until lightly crisped on both sides. If this is to be eaten as a savory, sprinkle a little red chili or paprika on top just before serving. This is cooked like cornmeal mush, molded in a bread pan, and then sliced and fried. It is delicious with a clear corn flavor and odd purple-blue color. It's good with eggs and bacon, or with butter.

Set aside FOR FILLING: In a small bowl combine cream cheese and sugar; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add whole egg and milk; beat until combined.

In a small mixer bowl beat egg yolks and vanilla on medium speed about 5 minutes or until thick and lemon colored. Gradually add the 1/3 cup sugar, beating until sugar is dissolved. Stir in banana and nuts. Thoroughly wash the beaters. In a large mixing bowl beat the egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form (tips curl). Gradually add the 1/2 cup sugar, beating on high speed until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight). Fold yolk mixture into egg whites. Sprinkle the flour mixture evenly over egg mixture; fold in just until blended. Carefully spread the batter evenly over the filling in the pan. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until the cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately loosen the cake from sides of pan and turn out onto a towel sprinkled with powdered sugar. Carefully peel off paper. Starting with narrow end, roll up cake using towel as a guide. (Do not roll towel into cake.) Cool completely on a wire rack. Spread top with Cream Cheese Frosting #3 (there are other recipes in the master file, if desired--#3 goes with this recipe). If desired, drizzle with chocolate syrup. Makes 10 servings.

NOTES: * Simple dessert for failed Pavlova attempts -- My mother used to make the banana variety of this when she cooked her meringues a little too long or too hot. I've no idea of its origins. * I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the banana version. Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never tried it. * This is a neat way of saving a Pavlova attempt when the meringue part fails: it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever know... : Difficulty: very simple. : Time: 10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available. : Precision: No need to measure. : Marcus G Hand, : AT&amp;T Information Systems, Middletown, NJ. : mtuni!mgh : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cook up lots of chopped onions and some hamburger meat (the amount depended upon how flush the pocket book was at the time). Of course, my mother used to use a little bacon fat in the pan to begin with, and drain off any extra fat from the hamburger, tho we raised our own meat, and it was pasture fed, pretty lean. Meanwhile get a BIG pot of water boiling and cook up a mess of elbow macaroni - depending on how much you need to stretch the recipe. We always used "the macaroni kettle", and woe if something else was in it. Remember - I made this for 14 people, and I still always make too much. And we are not talking pasta here, we need plain old Prince elbow macaroni. Here is where my family added their own touch. Rather than Campbell's tomato soup, we used our own home grown canned tomatoes. My mother used to can about 200 quarts a season. So dump a quart or so of good thick canned tomatoes (break up the whole tomatoes a bit) in with the hamburger and onions, add the macaroni, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve up in big bowls with homemade bread. We came to like it best made this way. If you use the Campbells' tomato soup variation, just add enough soup to make the mixture nice and gooey. Some people, being fancier than we were, would put the whole mixture in a big casserole dish, top it with buttered bread crumbs and bake it for a short time in the oven. This used to appear at Pot-Luck Suppers with great regularity.

      <li>Remove the skin and membranes from the oranges and slice them in 1/4-inch slices. Place a layer of orange slices in the bottom of a large glass bowl, add a layer of coconut, then a layer of papaya, then blackberries, then starfruit, and then pecans . Repeat the process until all the fruit has been used. If the oranges are not especially sweet, a light layer of blueberry or clover honey will help.

      <li>be baked up to 1 week ahead. Preheat oven to 375 F. Lightly grease 15-1/2"x10-1/2" jelly roll pan. Line bottom and sides with waxed paper; grease paper. Filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar with electric mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs, milk, and vanilla JUST until blended. Spread evenly in lined pan. Cake: Beat eggs, sugar, orange peel, and vanilla in large bowl with electric mixer on high speed 8-12 minutes, until very thick, pale, and at least tripled in volume. (Eggs are the only leavening in this cake, so it is very important to beat them to maximum volume. Use a large, deep, narrow bowl rather than a wide one. An 8-cup glass measure is perfect.) Sprinkle with flour. Fold until just blended. Add butter and fold until just blended. Spread evenly over filling in pan. Bake 19-21 minutes, until cake springs back when touched in center. While cake bakes, spread clean kitchen towel (not paper or terry cloth) on countertop. Sift powdered sugar through small strainer over towel, covering an area the size of the cake. Invert hot cake onto towel. Remove pan and carefully peel off paper. Starting at one narrow end, neatly roll up cake, using towel as an aid. Cool completely on wire rack. Wrap and refrigerate up to 1 week. When ready to serve, garnish with candied citrus slices. Candied citrus slices: choose fruit with thin skin for best results. We used three varieties to vary size of slices. Use leftovers to garnish other desserts or as an accompaniment to ham or poultry. Scrub skins. Slice in 18"-thick rounds. Bring water and sugar to boil in wide skillet. Add one citrus type at a time in a single layer. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered 20-40 minutes, until translucent. Remove to bowl with slotted spoon; repeat with remaining fruit. Pour syrup over slices; add a little water if syrup is too thick. Refrigerate up to 3 months.

It is titled, "Rasachandrika, Saraswat Cookery Book, by the Saraswat Mahila Samaz of Bombay. Nearly all of the book is vegetarian. It's just full of short recipes. 1. Wash and cook dal in the cooker until very soft. Beat it well. 2. Add salt, jaggery, turmeric powder, chillies and water to bring it to the required liquid consistency. Cook until the dal comes to a boil. 3. Heat oil, and prepare a seasoning with mustard seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida and curry leaves. (This means to fry them a little, until the mustard seeds pop.) Add it to the dal. 4. Lastly add the coriander leaves . (Note in the book: this varan should be sweet and sour to taste.) CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #043 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>From: Natalie Frankel &lt;Natalie.Frankel@mixcom.com&gt; Date: Wed, 10 Jul 1996 23:13:19 -0500 I've received several requests for the recipe, so I thought I'd post it to the group since it might not be retrievable from the archives with them down at this time. The original poster was Iggulden Christin I 4cii@qlink.queensu.ca&gt;. I altered the recipe by adding canned creamed corn (which you know is just corn - there is no cream). Preheat oven to 425 degrees f. Pam spray an 8" X 8 " cake pan or equivalent iron skillet or other oven-proof pan and put into the oven to preheat. Mix all ingredients, pour batter into heated pan and bake for 20 mins. Freezes well - if it lasts that long. Refrigerate any leftovers and serve cold or it also improves when reheated for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees and gets crisp. Christine likes it hot out of the oven with molasses. fatfree digest V96 #191 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Pineapple puree; from half a fresh pineapple</li>
      <li>1 cup Fresh orange juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Coconut extract</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Flaked coconut; unsweetened</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes 1 quart, serving 8, at 65 cals. Time varies from 1 to 5 hours, depending upon freezing method. If using fresh pineapple: cut the rind, eyes, and core from the pineapple. Cut the flesh into chunks and puree them in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. You should have about 2 cups of puree. (Unsweetened pineapple chunks, pureed.) Add the orange juice, coconut extract, and ricotta and process briefly. Chill the mixture and freeze in an electric or hand-cranked ice-cream machine, following the manufacturer's instructions. To make the sorbet in your freezer, transfer the mixture to a bowl and place in the freezer. When the liquid has frozen solid, about 2 to 3 hours, remove it from the freezer and, with a fork, break it into large chunks. Place the chunks in a food processor and process with the metal blade until smooth and creamy. Return to the bowl and freeze for at least 30 minutes more. Toast the coconut: Set oven at 350F. Spread coconut on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until lightly colored, stirring or shaking 2 or 3 times. To serve, place scoops of sorbet in dessert dishes and sprinkle with the toasted coconut. PER SERVING: 46.0 cals, 1.5 g fat (28.3% cff) &gt;From (1990) Edward J.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Diced or peeled tomatoes; chopped (or "basic" sauce)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Diced bacon</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
      <li>1/2 Onion; finely shredded</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon White wine; optional</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch Black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch Oreganon; optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(in Italy it's usually served with spaghetti) Place oil, onion, garlic, and bacon (and the optional white wine) in a saucepan. Cover and simmer on low heat until the onion is very tender (it takes about 60 minutes if you're using wine, or 45 minutes if no wine is added). Add tomatoes, salt and oreganon. Simmer for another half hour. Then remove the pan from the heat and add pepper. This sauce will stay fresh for a week if it's kept in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Like every other tomato based sauce, it can also be frozen for a longer life (up to 3 months); however, it's preferable to add salt and pepper after thawing.

      <li>1/2 A medium-sized green bell pepper; chopped</li>
      <li>1 small Onion; chopped</li>
      <li>28 ounces Spaghetti sauce</li>

      <li>8 ounces Uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 cup Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef, bell pepper, and onion over medium-high heat for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring to crumble the beef, and cook until no pink remains in the beef; drain off the excess liquid. Add the remaining ingredients except the cheese; mix well. Place in a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish that has been coated with nonstick vegetable spray; cover and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 more minutes, or until heated through and the cheese has melted. NOTE: This is a perfect dish to make ahead and freeze. You can even freeze it in individual portions. That way the kids can microwave a dish after school or anytime they need a quick meal.

      <li>Mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt together and then sift the mixture. In a separate bowl mix the water, corn oil vanilla and vinegar or lemon juice. The whisk the wet and dry mixtures together. Pour through a strainer into a clean bowl, breaking up and pressing through any lumps. Mix again and the pour the mixture into a greased 9 x 13 x 2-inch pan. Tap the edge of the pan against the counter or, for more fun but comparable results, drop the entire pan from a height of about 6-inches onto the counter top or the floor a few times to pop and dislodge any air bubbles. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes. Trust this recipe. The omission of eggs or butter is not an oversight. And you must pop the air bubbles as directed. I've had this cake several times and it IS good!

      <li>Preheat oven to 425f. Grease a pan ( I used a medium vision pot sprayed lightly with Pam) and put in oven to preheat. Mix all ingredients, pour batter into heated pan and bake for 20 min. This cornbread was quite moist and flavourful. I'd cut the sugar down or out if you were going to serve it with chilli or something like that. It is really great hot out of the oven with molasses. (It was the molasses discussions that got me thinking about ff corn bread. I have succesfully kept in an airtight container over night in the fridge....sorry, it doesen't last any longer! *To make applesauce quick I cut up 1 apple and put in a bowl with a bit of water and then microwave on high for about 2 min. Then I use my handblender to make it into sauce. Make sure you do this in a tall, thin container as it tends to spit up and hot apple sauce really burns! One apple makes about 1/3 of a cup so you could use storebought for this.

    <title>Amaretto Truffles</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GANACHE</li>
      <li>8 ounces Dark sweet chocolate</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Amaretto</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: DIPPING</li>
      <li>16 ounces Dark sweet chocolate</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GARNISH</li>
      <li>2 cups Chopped almonds</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>from the book Chocolate Truffles by Carrie Huber. Making the Ganache: To prepare ganache, chop or grate chocolate into small pieces. Place in top half of double boiler along with cream. Put hot (not boiling) water in bottom half of a double boiler, making sure the water doesn't touch the top pan. Stir often with wooden spoon. When all of the chocolate has melted, beat until well combined. Remove from heat, let cool to room temperature. Transfer to covered bowl and refrigerate overnight to harden. (Ganache will keep in this state for a few days if necessary.) Take a little ganache at a time and form 1" balls, using fingertips (with as little contact as possible so the chocolate doesn't soften). Keep unused portion refrigerated as you work. Place balls on waxed paper-lined baking sheet; continue until ganache is used up. Refrigerate baking sheet until ganache is hardened, overnight or up to two days. Allow to set in refrigerator at least two hours before loosely covering with waxed paper. Foil can be substituted in all cases for waxed paper, but never use clear plastic wrap. It clings too tightly to the candies and traps moisture inside which discolors the chocolate. Prepare Chocolate Coating: Chop or grate chocolate into small pieces. Heat chocolate and oil together in top of double boiler over hot water, stirring until smooth with a wooden spoon. Insert candy thermometer and begin dipping the ganache balls when temperature registers between 85-90F. If chocolate begins to cool and thicken before you're finished dipping, reheat over hot water. Work with only 1/2 dozen at a time, keeping the rest refrigerated. Drop a single ganache ball into the chocolate, turning to coat well, then lift it with the fork. Allow excess chocolate to drip back into pan, then gently rap fork against edge of pan to remove more chocolate from ball. Failure to do this will cause a large dribbly "platform" or "skirt" to form around the base of each hardened truffle. (this makes it difficult to pack them side by side in a box.) There are two schools of thoughts as to the proper method of depositing truffles onto the baking sheet: A) If you are conservative by nature it's best to gently slide them off the fork with a butterknife, onto the waiting baking sheet. B) If you intend to further decorate the truffle, the second method, (for the show-offs among us) involves dropping the truffle off the fork upside down directly onto the baking sheet. Quickly manipulate the single strand of chocolate, adhering to the fork, into some glorious shape atop the candy, like the pros do. Either way is acceptable, although the second way requires some practice and an accurate thermometer to get it right. If your chocolate temperature is off by a few degrees, you're likely to find a chocolate highway - not a chocolate strand - adhering to the fork when that critical moment comes. The perfect finale for the basic recipes, for instance, is a sprinkling of shaved dark chocolate over the top, or better yet, gently rolling each newly-dipped truffle in the shavings to coat completely. Refrigerate all truffles after dipping several hours or overnight to harden. When ganache has cooled to room temperature, add Amaretto.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash fruit. Cut grapefruit into 8 wedges and orange and lemon into 4 wedges. Then cut wedges crosswise into thin slices; save juice. In 6 quart kettle, combine all fruit, fruit juice and 1 1/2 quarts water. Bring to boiling; boil rapidly, uncovered for 30 minutes or until peel is tender. Measure fruit mixture; return to kettle. Add 1 cup sugar for each cup of fruit mixture. Bring to boiling, stirring, until sugar is dissolved; boil rapidly, stirring frequently 30 minutes or until mixture is thick and reaches jellying point. Meanwhile sterilize 8 jelly glasses by boiling them 20 minutes. Keep in hot water until ready to fill. Lift out with tongs. Remove marmalade from heat. Ladle immediately into hot, sterilized glasses, filling to within 1/2-inch of top. Cover immediately with 1/8-inch of hot paraffin. Let glasses stand overnight or until cool. Cover glasses with metal lids. Makes 7 or 8 glasses. *To test for jellying point: dip a large metal spoon into boiling syrup; tilt spoon so syrup runs off edge. Syrup is at jellying point when it doesn't flow, but divides into 2 drops that run together and sheet from the spoon.

      <li>Crushed</li>
      <li>3 1/4 pounds Superbrau plain light malt</li>
      <li>1 pound Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 pound Crystal malt grain</li>

      <li>1 ounce Northern brewer (45 min)</li>
      <li>1/2 ounces Northern brewer (15 min)</li>
      <li>1 ounce Fuggles (5 min)</li>
      <li>Doric acid yeast</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Bring 1 1/2 gal water to 160 degrees and stir in crushed grains. Keep the mash temp between 148-152 for 1 hr. Best way is to place covered brewing kettle in 140 degree oven. Stir twice while mashing. Test the mash conversion by placing drop of mash onto white plate, then place a drop of iodine into the solution. If solution turns purple/black you must continue the mash until the solution is clear when the iodine is added. Pour mash thru a strainer, allowing the wort to flow thru into your brew pot. Bring 1-2 gal water to 135-150 degrees. Slowly sparge the grains with sparge water until it runs clear. The sparge water will become part of the boil. At this point you will continue as usual. Dissolve malt extract and brown sugar into wort, add 1 oz northern brewer hops and boil for 45 min. Add 1/2 oz plug and boil for 15 min more. For the last 5 min of the boil, add the fuggles pellets. Cool the wort and bring volume up to 5 gal.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place a sheet of strudel dough on a damp kitchen towel and butter generously with melted butter. Sprinkle with a thin layer of bread crumbs and top with a second sheet of dough. Brush this layer with butter and spirnkle with a few of the bread crumbs. Repeat, making a second strudel base. Toss together the apples, walnuts, sugar, cinnamon and remaining bread crumbs. Spread half the apple mixture on a three inch strip down the center of each dough, leaving 2 inches of space on each side. Roll the strudel with the aid of the towel, jelly roll fashion, staring at the long sid nearest you. Tuck in the edges of the dough and place the strudel seam, side down on a buttered baking sheet. Brush generously with part of remaining butter. Repeat with second strudel. Bake the strudels in a preheated oven for 35-30 minutes. If they are browning too quickly tent with aluminum foil, but remove it ten minutes before cooking time is complete. Dust the strudels with sifted confectioners sugar and serve warm.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sterilize 8 (12 oz Ball Quilted Crystal - #14400-81400) canning jars, lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow to air-dry and cool. Leave the lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use. Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them (use a pastry brush) with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water; set aside. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts. Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full. Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll fall over. Bake in a preheated 325-degree oven for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into the center of each cake comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven, one-at-a-time (use HEAVY-DUTY MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid, then a ring on top and screw down tightly. Place jars onto your counter top to cool. You'll know when the jars have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound, test them by pressing down on the lids once the jars have cooled--they shouldn't move at all. Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year. I've only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they don't last that long around here. They're wonderful for last minute gifts, especially for single friends.

Add the nuts, and stir well. Pour cake mixture into wide-mouth canning jars. WARNING: Please use only canning jars that are specially tempered. Do not use cans or other jars that may not be appropriate for this method due to lead content. Or, use a special crockpot baking pan available thruough Rival Co. To assure that baked cakes will slip out easily, grease inside of jars well. (Lining bottom of jars with waxed paper also will help.) Cover each jar with a piece of foil greased on one side. Place greased side down and press foil around edges to seal tightly. Place jars in crockpot with crockery liner in place. Cover; cook on high-heat setting for 2 3/4 to 3 hours or till cakes spring back when touched and a wooden tothpick inserted near the centers comes out clean. Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes. Unmold cakes; remove waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with whipped topping, if desired. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #774 by "jana@cablenet-va.com" &lt;jana@cablenet-va.com&gt; on Sep 7, 1997</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325-degrees. Sterilize 5 straight-sided Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400- 81400) canning jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Keep the lids and rings in the water until you're ready to use them. Remove the jars from the water and place them on a clean dish towel to air-dry (up, not upside down). When the jars are cool enough to handle, grease the insides with shortening (DO NOT use butter, margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret); set aside. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves; set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water. Blend the dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts.; set aside. Fill well greased jars half full. Place the jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip over. Bake for 35 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. like you would any canned goods. The method for making the cakes is the same -- no matter which recipe you use. The only difference will be the ingredients (of course), the amount of jars needed and the baking times- -that's all, everything else is the same. Don't limit yourself to the recipes I'm giving you -- use your favorite quick-bread recipe. I plan on trying the Carrot Cake recipe I posted.

    <category>Cakes</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/3 cups Shortening</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup Applesauce</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 2/3 cups All purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Chopped walnuts;=</li>
      <li>Optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sterilize 8 (12 oz. Ball Quilted Crystal-#14400-81400) canning jars, lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow to air- dry and cool. Leave the lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use .. Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them (use a pastry brush) with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water; set aside. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts. Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full. Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll fall over. Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into the center of each cake comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven, one at a time (use HEAVY- DUTY MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid, then a ring on top and screw down tightly. Place jars onto your counter top to cool. You'll know when the jars have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound, test them by pressing down on the lids once the jars have cooled--they shouldn't move at all. Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year. I've only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they don't last that long around here. They're wonderful for last minute gifts, especially for single friends. Contributed by Lynn in Chicago, IL.

      <li>1 cup Sifted all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Seedless raisins</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix sugars and add applesauce. Sift together dry ingrediants and stir in. Add oats and raisins. Drop by spoonfuls onto lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees about 10 minutes. Note: I left out the raisins because I don't care for them. Also, I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. The next time I make these I may cut back on the sugar because they are rather sweet. These cookies were nice and fluffy (for a fat-less cookie) and remind me of muffins. These are so quick and easy to make, I just love them! I hope everyone enjoys them.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>5 cups Apples (tart); (note below) peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown sugar; firmly packed</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>2 Pie crust shells (9"); unbaked</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix together the apples, brown sugar water and lemon juice in a 2-quart saucepan. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 7-8 minutes or JUST until apples are tender. Mix together the flour, granulated sugar and salt; stir into apple mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir 1 minute; remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla and butter or margarine; cool. Preheat oven to 425-degrees. Prepare pastry (or use store-bought). Turn apple mixture into pastry-lined pie plate. Cover with top crust in which you've cut slits; flute the edges. Cover edge of pie crust with foil (or cut out an aluminum pan--keeping just the edge) to prevent excessive browning; remove foil during the last 15 minutes of baking. Bake 40-45 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Note: I've found that ANY recipe calling for tart apples, you get more flavor by mixing the types of apples. As we have an abundance of varied apples, Fuji's, Granny Smith and Gala's...they all vary in flavor, texture, etc. Experiment with your favorite From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Light Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground Ginger</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 325F. Brush a 10 inch springform pan with soft butter. Coat the pan with 1/4 cup superfine sugar, lightly tap out excess sugar, and set pan aside. Combine 1 cup butter and remaining 2 cups superfine sugar in a bowl of an electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed, scraping down the side with a rubber spatula, until mixture is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Carefully fold in the applesauce. Do not overmix. Sift together 2 3/4 cups flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, cloves, salt, and baking powder. Fold the dry ingredients and pecans into the applesauce mixture. Add the vanilla, Calvados, and apple slices, and mix until just combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared springform pan. Combine the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespons flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, brown sugar, and ginger in a small mixing bowl. Mix with fingers until just combined, and sprinkle lightly over batter. Place cake in oven and bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 50 minutes. Let stand until completely cool. Applesauce Makes about 7 cups 18 McIntosh apples about 6 lbs. peeled, cored, and quartered. 1 cup apple cider 1 large cinnamon stick 1/2 vanilla bean 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground mace 1/2 cp sugar, or to taste 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (about 1 lemon, strained) Combine apples, apple cider, cinnamon, vanilla bean, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, mace, sugar, and lemon juice in a large heavy bottomed wide saucepan. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon to prevent scorching, until the apples are broken down and saucy, about 50 to 60 minutes. Mash any large pieces of apple with a large wooden spoon to help them break down. Adjust seasoning to taste with more sugar and spices. Remove the apple mixture from the heat, and let stand to cool completely before serving, discarding the cinnamon sticks and vanilla pod. Applesauce can also be stored in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days in refrigerator.

TO MAKE THE CAKE; Preheat oven to 325. Cream the butter and sugar together until very light and fluffy. Fold in the applesauce. Sift together the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and baking soda. (Remove 1/4 cupof the flour and toss it with the raisins and pecans). Fold the flour mixture into the batter. Add the 1 t. of vanilla frosting and fold in the raisins/nuts mixture as well. Pour into a 9" greased and floured tube pan. Bake 1 1/2 hours or until done. Cool in pan slightly before turning onto a rack to cool. When cool, frost. Can be kept for several weeks (but its so good it won't last) Top surface may not be flat, but frosting will smooth it. Serves 10-12.

      <li>From: FSelkovits@aol.com Date: Mon, 6 Nov 1995 18:49:31 GMT The recipes I've seen use applesauce to replace most but not all of the oil in a standard recipe. This is a flavorful and moist chocolate cake. Mix eggs, vanilla, oil, and applesauce together until well blended. Combine the dry ingredients and add to the egg mixture. Beat for another 2 minutes. Stir in the carrots. Pour into greased 13x9 pan. Bake at 350 for 50 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.

It will be smooth and not very sticky. Dust hands with cinnamon to be able to handle the dough. Dust a rolling pin and board with cinnamon and roll out to about 1/4 an inch thick or more. (thinner dough than this tends to curl during baking) Cut out with holiday cookie cutters. Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 150 degrees for one hour. Remove from the cookie sheets and bake on the oven racks for another hour and a half. Decorate with fabric paints, candy-shaped beads, silk holly, or whatever you want. Hot glue a ribbon or a small magnet to the back, or hot glue several to a ribbon wrapped grapevine wreath. (Ho, Ho, Ho) REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /MISC From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>2/3 cups SHORTENING</li>
      <li>2 2/3 cups GRANULATED SUGAR</li>
      <li>4 Large EGGS</li>
      <li>2 cups APPLESAUCE</li>
      <li>2/3 cups WATER</li>
      <li>3 1/3 cups ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, sifted</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons BAKING POWDER</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons BAKING SODA</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons SALT</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon GROUND CINNAMON</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons GROUND CLOVES</li>
      <li>2/3 cups NUTS; chopped,optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sterilize 8 (12 oz Ball Quilted Crystal - #14400-81400) canning jars, lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow to air-dry and cool. Leave the lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use. Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them (use a pastry brush) with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water; set aside. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts. Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full. Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll fall over. Bake in a preheated 325-degree oven for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into the center of each cake comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven, one-at-a-time (use HEAVY-DUTY MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid, then a ring on top and screw down tightly. Place jars onto your counter top to cool. You'll know when the jars have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound, test them by pressing down on the lids once the jars have cooled--they shouldn't move at all. Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year. I've only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they don't last that long around here. They're wonderful for last minute gifts, especially for single friends. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Quantity: An average of 19 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 12-1/4 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 48 pounds and yields 16 to 19 quarts-an average of 2-3/4 pounds per quart. Quality: Select apples that are juicy, crispy, and preferably both sweet and tart. Procedure: Wash, peel, and core apples. To prevent discoloration, slice apples into water containing ascorbic acid. Raw packs make poor quality products. Place drained slices in large saucepan and add 1 pint water or very light, light, or medium syrup (see "Preparing and Using Syrups") per 5 pounds of sliced apples. Boil 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Fill jars with hot slices and hot syrup or water, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process. Processing directions for canning sliced apples in a boiling-water, a dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. Table 1. Recommended process time for Apples, sliced in a boiling-water canner. Style of Pack: Hot. Jar Size: Pints or Quarts. Process Time at Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 20 min. 1,001 - 3,000 ft: 25 min. 3,001 - 6,000 ft: 30 min. Above 6,000 ft: 35 min. Table 2.

      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Brown sugar; firmly packed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 cup Applesauce</li>
      <li>2 Egg whites (I used 1/4 cup liquid egg substitute)</li>
      <li>1 cup Skim milk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 08:11:30 -0700 From: bwatson@cisco.com (Bethann Watson) I tried this recipe from Sarah Schlesinger's cookbook "500 Fat-Free Recipes," and it is very good. I've had a slice of this bread and a cup of nonfat yogurt for breakfast the last few days. The bread is also a good evening snack. Thought others in the group would like it. BTW, I love Sarah Schlesinger's cookbook--heard about it on this list, too! Every recipe I have tried has come out very well. I heartily recommend it. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and cinnamon. Stir in the applesauce, egg whites, and milk. Pour into a nonstick loaf pan, or a pan lined witha baking pan liner or lightly sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. Let stand for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 325F. Bake bread for 50 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of the bread comes out dry. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Makes 10 servings. You could probably add chopped, dried fruit to this recipe without any problems. Also, soy or rice milk (or even spice tea) could probably be substituted for the skim milk. To make it more of a spice bread, next time I will reduce the cinnamon to 2 1/2 teaspoons and add 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/8 teaspoon cloves, and 1/8 teaspoon cardamom.

      <li>This stuff makes the most fantastic toast. It's also not bad untoasted. We have made it successfully making the bread as listed, but adding only 1 Tbsp of white sugar and no cinnamon at the beginning, and then adding a cinnamon/brown sugar mixture 30 s. or a minute before the end of the last kneading cycle. The sugar/cinnamon ends up marbled through the bread, and it is wonderful (hard to get right though) &gt;From: Matthew Asplund &lt;ASPLUNDM@PLASMA.BYU.EDU&gt; From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe Recipe By : rec.food.recipes</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours if using a cooked ham. Pick over and wash dried apples. Cover with water and let soak over night or for a number of hours. In the morning, cover ham with cold water and let boil for 3 hours. Add the apples and water in which they have been soaked and continue to boil for another hour. Add brown sugar. Make dumplings by sifting together the flour, salt, pepper and baking powder. Stir in the beaten egg, milk (enough to make fairly moist, stiff batter), and melted butter. Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot liquid with the ham and apples. Cover kettle tight and cook dumplings for 15 minutes. Serve piping hot on large platter. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes, Culinary Arts Press, 1936.

(c1992) It features recipes from the '40s when Oak Ridge, TN was fenced and people had to have a security clearance to get in. I picked one recipe for you. If you have any particular kind of recipe you would be interested in let me know. The person who supplied this recipe remembers that there was only one grocery store in the area back in 1943 and she remembers waiting in line for 2 hours to buy soap powder.

Let them air dry over night before using. If you are going to use for hanging ornaments punch a hole in the top with a straw(drinking kind). This recipe used a lot of cinnamon so drain the applesause first then add the spice. You can use any spice, apple pie or pumpkin pie spice are nice too. So is a little nutmeg added to the cinnamon.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE PIE CRUST</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>12 tablespoons Chilled butter cut into 1/4 to 3/8 inch cubes</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chilled all-vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>7 tablespoons Ice water; up to 8</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE FILLING</li>
      <li>4 Granny smith and 4 macintosh apples</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Grated lemon zest</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Allspice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 Egg white; lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar for topping</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pulse flour, salt and sugar in food processor fitted with steel blade. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture, tossing to coat butter with a little of the flour. Pulse machine 5 times in 1 second bursts. Add shortening and continue pulsing until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter bits no larger than small peas, 4 to 6 more 1 second pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl. If you don't have a food processor, grate frozen butter and shortening into flour mixture and mix with your hands for 1 minute, rubbing flour and shortening between your fingers. Flour should turn very pale yellow and become coarser in texture. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of ice water over mixture. With blade of rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix. Press down on dough with broad side of spatula until dough sticks together. Shape into ball with hands, divide the dough into two balls one sightly larger than the other. Dust lightly with flour, wrap separately in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove dough from refrigerator. The dough is ready to be rolled when it is still cool to the touch but you can push your finger halfway down through the center. If the dough has been chilled for more than 1 hour, it may have to sit on the counter for 10 to 20 minutes to soften. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Roll larger dough disk on lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick, the depth of a quarter. Transfer and fit dough into 9-inch Pyrex pan, leaving dough that overhangs the lip in place. Refrigerate dough while preparing the fruit. Peel apples, quarter, and remove core. Slice each quarter into thirds, about 1/2-inch thick. Toss with lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, sugar, spices. Turn fruit mixture, including any juices, into pie shell. Roll out the remaining ball of dough and place it over the top of the pie. Trim top and bottom edges to 1/2-inch beyond pan lip. Tuck this rim of dough underneath itself so that folded edge is flush with pan lip. Flute dough in your own fashion, or press with fork tines to seal. Cut four slits at right angles on dough top to allow steam to escape. Brush egg white on top of crust and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar evenly over the top. Place pie on bottom rack. Bake until crust is lightly golden, 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and continue to bake until juices bubble and crust is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. The bottom crust should be golden and the juices from pie bubbling. Transfer pie to wire rack: let cool to almost room temperature about 4 hours. Pie is best eaten after it has completely cooled, even the next day. Variations: Crystallized Ginger Apple Pie Add 3 tablespoons of chopped ginger to apple mixture. Dried Raisin, Cherry or Cranberry Apple Pie Macerate 1 cup dried fruit (chopped coarse if large) in the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon liqueur Apple Jack, brandy or cognac. Toss with apple mixture. Fresh Cranberry Pie Add 1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries to apples, and increase sugar to 1 cup from 3/4 cup.

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>MELTING CHOCOLATE Chocolate scorches easily, so always melt it over hot - not boiling - water. It is best to use a double boiler, but you can improvise by using a c or bowl in a small saucepan over very gentle heat. The water must be kept below simmering to prevent steam from curling up and hitting the chocolate. If steam gets into the melted chocolate it will immediately thicken the mixture to a stiff mass. If this does happen, however, you can rescue the chocolate by softening it again. To do this, add 1-2 tb of vegetable shortening (never use butter as it contains moisture which will cause the chocolate stiffen even more!) to the chocolate and stir vigorously. You can also melt chocolate directly over very low heat in a heavy gauge saucepan, but you must watch the mixture carefully. HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE CURLS Use a vegetable peeler with a long narrow blade and a chunk or bar of chocolate. Warm chocolate and blade slightly. Be sure your peeler is absolutely dry. Draw the peeler along the smooth surface of the chocolate. HOW TO GRATE CHOCOLATE Be sure that the block of chocolate is cool and firm. Grate on hand grater, cleaning the grater often so that the chocolate doesn't clog the surface of the blade. You cn use a blender, but be sure to cut the chocolate into sm pieces first. HOW TO STORE CHOCOLATE Chocolate should be stored in a cool, dry place at a temperature of about 60F. If the chocolate becomes too warm, the cocoa butter rises to the surface and forms a dusty gray film known as "bloom." This "bloom" is not harmful and, once the chocolate is melted, it returns to its natural rich brown color. If you do store chocolate in the refrigerator or freezer, take in out and let it stand until it returns to room temperature before you use it in a recipe. Chocolate is very sensitive to sudden changes of temperature and you will not get the best results if you do not treat it with respect.

      <li>1 cup All-bran</li>
      <li>1 cup Flour</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Soak first four ingredients together for at least 1 hour. Mix the flour in well, and put into a greased lined loaf tin and bake for approximately 1 hour at 180C (GM4 375F). The cake is delicious, and served in slices with a little margarine on. If you wrap it in foil and keep for a few days (if it lasts that long) the flavour gets even better. The all-bran is available in the UK as Kellogg's AllBran. It's sort of little sticks of high-fibre bran stuff. If you can't get it in the US, I don't know what the equivalent is (not having been to the US myself). [You should come visit!

In the morning place the chicken in the slow cooker and add marinade up to about an inch from the top of the container. Set the cooker on low and cover. 6 to 8 hours later, turn the cooker to high. About an hour later, saute the sliced mushrooms in the margarine or butter. Then add the mushrooms (with pan juices), mandarin sections, green pepper and ginger into the slow cooker and stir thoroughly. Mix together the cornstarch, milk and cold water, then gradually add into the slow cooker while stirring until the entire mixture thickens a bit. Re-cover the slow cooker and let simmer for 15 to 30 minutes until serving. Serve with baby carrots and small new potatoes.</li>

Remove from heat; slowly stir in confectioners' sugar (if added too fast, glaze will be lumpy). Stir in vanilla. Note: Glaze must be warm when ready to pour over cake. 4. Place 1 cake round upside down onto cake platter. Top with pudding mixture; it will be a thick layer. Place second cake layer on filling. Slowly pour warm glaze over the top; allow it to run down sides. Chill 2 to 4 hours before serving.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make a dark roux with olive oil and flour. When roux is dark brown, add onion, green onion, bell pepper, and celery; cover and cook until onions are clear, stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes and continue cooning for 10 min; stir often. Add water and stir to make a thick liquid. Add garlic, Worcestershire, lemon juice, salt, hot sauce, wine, and tomato sauce, making sure to mix well. Add alligator, and enough water to cover the ingredients by 2 inches; stir to mix. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. After it comes to a boil, turn heat to low and cover, checking from time to time, and stir to prevent sauce from sticking. Continue cooking for 3 to 4 hrs. until meat is tender. Serve over cooked rice or spaghetti with Parmesan cheese. Freeze leftovers in serving size containers. This recipe is for a party--no one would go to this much trouble if the recipe only fed 4 peoples.

    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The many forms of Buckwheat!: Buckwheat Seed: It's a fruit, not a grain. Planted around the world. Triangular hard hull. Fresh seeds can be sprouted; ready-to-eat in about 5 days. Kasha: Hulled and roasted to bring out distinctive, nutlike flavor. Packaged four ways; whole, coarse, medium, fine. Whole Buckwheat Groats: Hulled and unroasted. Mild-flavored. Better than barley or rice! Cream of Buckwheat: 100% pure groats milled to the size of sesame seeds. Look like corn grits and other "cream of..." cereals, but taste better. Buckwheat Flour: Both light and whole buckwheat flour are 100% buckwheat. Gluten-free. For fiber and flavor, each contains very finely milled particles of buckwheat hulls (more in whole flour).

If you want a more orangey-red color the new raspberry ginger ale flavor (pink) also tastes good. Notice this is not too sweet. If you have a good size punch bowl a bundt cake pan molds an ice ring that will last several hours before it melts unless it is 100F in the shade. Congratulations!

      <li>Ingredient Group: HOW TO MELT CHOCOLATE</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Always melt chocolate with gentle heat because it scorches easily. If chocolate is to be melted alone, make certain that the container and utensils are absolutely dry; a tiny drop of moisture will cause the chocolate to become lumpy and stiff. If this should happen, stir in one teaspoon of vegetable shortening for each ounce of chocolate. Remember that unsweetened chocolate liquifies when melted, but semisweet and baking chocolate will hold their shapes until stirred. For faster melting, cut or chop chocolate into smaller pieces. To melt chocolate, place it in a heavy saucepan over low heat and stir until melted. Or, place chocolate in top of a double boiler and melt over hot water, stirring until smooth. To melt chocolate in a microwave oven, place a 1-ounce square in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave, uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for 1 to 2 minutes or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir until completely melted and smooth. Add 10 seconds for each additional ounce of chocolate. To melt chocolate morsels in a microwave oven, place 1 cup chocolate morsels in a 2-cup measure. Microwave, uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for 2 to 4 minutes or until morsels are glossy. Stir until smooth.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(Optional: Any combination of stuff like poppy seeds, celery seeds, toasted sesame seeds, Lawry's Seasoned Salt) Microwave the potato(s) for about 8 minutes more or less, depending on your potato(s) and your microwave. Then, put them in a blender (do not peel) with the water and whirl until you have a puree. Set aside. In a hot skillet (I use my trusty electric wok), saute the onion in the olive oil until it's the way you like it. Pour in the potato puree, and moosh it around, cooking the hell out of it until it's also the way you like it (is there any other way?), adding seasonings to taste. That's it! This is great over steamed veggies or grains or biscuits or toast or eggs or corn on the cob or spinach even potatos! You could try it over ice cream or fruit salad but you'd be really weird.

      <li>Ingredient Group: CHOCOLATE GARNISHES</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>CHOCOLATE LEAVES: Select non-poisonous leaves such as mint or rose leaves. Wash the leaves and pat dry with paper towels. Melt 1 or 2 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double boiler; let cool slightly. Using a small spatula, spread a thin layer of chocolate on the back of each leaf. Place leaves on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet, chocolate side up; freeze until chocolate is firm, about 10 minutes. Grasp leaf at stem end and carefully peel away from chocolate. Chill leaves until ready to use. CHOCOLATE CURLS: Melt 4 (1-ouce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double bliler. Pour chocolate out into a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Spread chocolate with a spatula into a 3-inch-wide strip. Smooth top with a spatula. Chill chocolate until it feels slightly tacky but not firm. (If too hard, curls will break; if too soft, chocolate will not curl.) Gently pull a vegetable peeler across chocolate until curls form. Transfer curls to a tray by inserting a wooden pick in end of curl. Chill curls until ready to use. CHOCOLATE-DIPPED FRUIT: Make sure fruit is completely dry before dipping. Melt 4 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot vater in a double boiler; transfer to a small bowl, and let cool slightly. Grasp fruit by stem and dip in chocolate, turning to coat the bottom of the fruit. Allow excess to drip back into bowl. Lay fruit on side on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Allow fruit to stand at room temperature until chocolate hardens or place in refrigerator about 10 minutes. Don't store coated fruit in refrigerator; the chocolate coating will sweat when returned to room temperature and will lose its sheen. CHOCOLATE CUTOUTS: Melt 6 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double boiler; cool slightly. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil; pour the chocolate onto the cookie sheet, and gently shake it until chocolate is smooth and level and about 1/8-inch thick. Let stand until partially set. Press a cookie cutter half-way through the chocolate to outline shapes. Remove the cutter, and let stand until chocolate is firm. When hard, reposition the cutter over the oulines, and press down to cut smoothly. Lift the cutter up, and remove the cutout by gently pressing through the cutter with a small wooden utensil (fingers will leave prints on chocolate). GRATED CHOCOLATE: You can grate unsweetened, semisweet, or milk chocolate to sprinkle on top of pies, etc. It's easiest done in a food processor, but you can grate it by hand. When grating by hand, hold chocolate with a paper towel or wax paper so heat from your hand will not soften or melt the chocolate.

It can be used on just about anything that you plan to barbecue, that is, to cook over low, indirect heat for a long period of time. For large red-meat roasts, such as leg of lamb or standing rib, increase the cayenne pepper from one teaspoon to one tablespoon and substitute one teaspoon cinnamon for the ground cloves.

      <li>In a large saucepan, warm garlic in 2 tablespoons oil over low heat until soft but not colored. Stir in tomato paste, then the tomatoes and their liquid. Simmer, uncovered, until sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 25 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper- before serving, stir in basil and remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Makes 2 cup. This chunky, rustic, and pungent sauce goes well with dried pasta as well as with fresh gnocchi and ravioli. Cook's Illustrated, Mar./Apr. 1994, Page 26. Credit: Julia Della Croce.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Shortening</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter Or Margarine; Softened</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups White Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kahlua Or Chocolate Liquer</li>
      <li>2 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Rolled Oats</li>
      <li>2 cups Semisweet Chocolate Chips; *See Note</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped Walnuts Or Pecans; Optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat oven to 375 °. Grease cookie sheets. 2. Cream together shortening, butter, sugars and eggs. 3. Add the rest of the ingredients (in order) and mix well. 4. Spoon a tablespoonful amount into hand, shape into a ball and place on greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden. Cool on rack a few minutes before eating. *Note- I add less chips because I don't like a lot of chocolate chips. The cookie dough tastes so good you don't need a lot of chips. I always use butter because I think it makes a better cookie. I also use butter flavor crisco instead of plain shortening. (These are comfort food remember..no low fat lol). Sometimes if the dough feels a little sticky I add extra flour (not too much) until it's easier to roll in your hands. I bake them on the reverse side of the cookie sheets and it works very well to make a nice chewy cookie. Don't let them overcook, as soon as the edges start to look brown, even if the center isn't set, they will be fine once they are cooled. Leave them on the cookie sheet for a minute or two and then cool completely on wire racks. When I picked up this recipe the author had written that these cookies stay soft for a long time. I don't know how she ever figured that out because they have never lasted longer than two days around here! Everyone who tastes them wants the recipe!

    <recipetext>
      <li>Canola Made from rape seeds. Canola oil has a bland flavor and is good for cooking and salad dressings. It has approximately 6 percent less saturated fat than other oils. Corn Made from the germ of the corn kernel. Corn oil is almost tasteless and is excellent for cooking because it can withstand high temperatures without smoking. It is high in polyunsaturated fat and is used to make margarine, salad dressings and mayonnaise. Olive A monosaturated oil extracted from tree-ripened olives. Olive oils range from light amber to green in color and bland to extremely strong in flavor. Olive oil is graded according to its degree of acidity and the process used to extract the oil. Oil labeled "virgin" is cold pressed, a process using no heat or chemicals and contains low levels of acidity. Oil labeled "pure" uses heat and chemicals to process olive residue from subsequent pressings. Peanut Made from pressed, steam-cooked peanuts. Peanut oil has a bland flavor and is good for cooking because it doesn't absorb or transfer flavors. Its smoking point is slightly lower than corn or safflower oil. Contains 17 percent saturated fat. Safflower A clear, almost flavorless oil made from the seeds of safflowers. Safflower oil is a favorite for salads because it doesn't solidify when chilled. It has more polyunsaturated fat that other oils but lacks vitamin E. Sesame Made from pressed sesame seeds. Sesame oil comes in two varieties: light (made with untoasted sesames) and dark (made with toasted sesames). Light sesame oil has a nutty flavor and is especially good for frying. Dark sesame oil (Asian) has a stronger flavor and should only be used in small quantities for flavoring foods -- not cooking. Both varieties are high in polyunsaturated fat. Sunflower Made from sunflower seeds. Sunflower oil is pale yellow and has a bland flavor. It is a good all-purpose oil low in saturated fat and high in polyunsaturated fat. Vegetable An inexpensive and all-purpose blend of oils made from plant sources such as vegetables, nuts and seeds. Most vegetable oils are made from soybeans and are high in polyunsaturaed fat and monounsaturated fat but low in saturated fat.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Maryellen: Here are some recipes from Native Peoples Magazine, using mesquite meal. I got these from their web site: http://www.nativepeoples.com/ Preheat oven to 350øF. In a mixing bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, mesquite meal, butter, 1 tablespoon honey, and cinnamon. Using fingers, press mixture evenly on bottom and half way up sides of 9-inch spring-form pan. Set aside. In large mixing bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat cream cheese, remaining honey, and vanilla until creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well. Stir in sour cream. Pour batter into crust; bake 50 to 60 minutes, until center sets. Turn off oven, leaving door slightly ajar. Leave cake in oven 1 hour; remove and allow to cool. Chill at least 2 hours; then prepare glaze and peel and slice peaches. Arrange peaches on top of cake and spoon over glaze. Return to refrigerator until ready to serve. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Prickly Pear Glaze: Combine 1/4 cup apple juice and cornstarch. In saucepan, combine remaining apple juice, prickly pear juice, and honey. Stir over medium heat until honey melts. Add cornstarch mixture and stir until mixture boils, thickens, and turns clear. Cook one minute and set aside to cool slightly.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Trimmed unpeeled beets</li>
      <li>7 large Eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups White vinegar (this is what recipe says--personally I think it needs more)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped onion</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cayenne</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe comes from the well know culinary family of Chef Paul Prudhomme of New Orleans. I got it from one of his cookbooks. *NOTE: If you prefer less vinegary taste, increase amount of sugar, but don't decrease or dilute vinegar. Cover beets with water. Boil until tender (about 25 minutes). Drain and cover with cool water. Set aside. Boil eggs in covered pan about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit 15 min. This keeps egg yolks from having green color. Peel--set aside. In 1 qt. sauce pan, combine vinegar, onions and garlic. Bring to a boil. Remove and strain vinegar into a bowl. Return vinegar to pan reserving onions etc. seperately. In a jar place 4 eggs. After beets are cool enough to handle, peel and slice 1/4 inch thick. Place half of the beet slices over the 4 eggs, then half of the strained garlic and onion. Then layer again with remaining ingredients. Posted to EAT-L Digest by MiKicks@AOL.COM on Jul 7, 1997</li>

      <li>ROASTED RICE POWDER (THINH) Roasted rice powder is used as a flavoring and binding agent in various recipes throughout this book. It is necessary to soak the rice first in order to obtain a deep golden color after roasting. Soaking also makes the rice easier to grind. 1/2 cup raw glutinous rice Soak the glutinous rice in warm water for 1 hour. Drain. Place the rice in a small skillet over moderate heat. Toast the rice, stirring constantly with chopsticks or a wooden spoon, until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process to a fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the ground rice through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy bits. Store the rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your refrigerator and use as needed. It will keep for up to 3 months. Yield: 1 cup. SCALLION OIL (HANH LA PHI): Many Vietnamese dishes require this delicate scallionflavored oil. Brushed over noodles, barbecued meats, vegetables or breads, it complements each item. 1/4 cup peanut oil, 2 scallions, finely sliced Heat the oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking, about 300F. Remove the pan from the heat and add the sliced scallions. Let the mixture steep at room temperature until completely cooled. This oil mixture will keep stored in a tightly covered jar at room temperature for 1 week. Yield: 1/4 cup CRISP FRIED SHALLOTS (HANH KHO PHI): This is an important ingredient in his many dishes throughout this book. Use as specified in recipes. 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots Heat the oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking, about 300F. Add the shallots and fry over moderate heat until crispy and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook. Immediately remove the shallots with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Reserve the oil for another use. Cooked this way, shallots can be stored in a tightly covered jar on the kitchen shelf for up to 1 month. Yield: about 1/3 cup. ROASTED PEANUTS (DAU PHONG RANG): Use shelled and skinned unsalted peanuts for this purpose. Cook a small amount at a time and use shortly after they are roasted to preserve their flavor. Amounts are specified in recipes using roasted peanuts. Place the peanuts in a skillet over moderate heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the nuts turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool. Pound in a mortar with a pestle or process in a spice grinder until the peanuts are a bit chunky. Store-bought dry-roasted-roasted unsalted peanuts may be substituted in recipes calling for roasted peanuts. PEANUT SAUCE (NUOC LEO): This delicious sauce originated in the central region and is used as a dip for many dishes in this book. Usually, tuong, a fermented soybean sauce, and glutinous rice are used to produce this sauce. After several experiments, I ended up with this variation where tuong and glutinous rice are replaced by hoisin sauce and peanut butter, ingredients that are more readily available. 1/4 cup roasted peanuts, ground, 1 tablespoon peanut oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 1 teaspoon chili paste (tuong ot tuoi), 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1/2 cup chicken broth or water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 1/4 cup hoisin sauce, 1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced Prepare the roasted peanuts. Set aside. Heat the oil in a small saucepan. When the oil is hot, add the garlic, chili paste and tomato paste, Fry until the garlic is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add the broth, sugar, peanut butter and hoisin sauce and whisk to dissolve the peanut butter. Bring to a boil, Reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Divide the sauce among individual dipping bowls and garnish with the ground peanuts and sliced chile. Serve warm or at room temperature. Yield: About 1 cup. VEGETABLE PLATTER (DIA RAU SONG): Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs, unripe fruits and raw vegetables. These are arranged attractively on a platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table, usually dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand. The following herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be authentic additions to the Vegetable Platter: One is the "saw leaf herb" (Eryngium foetidum, or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander relative. The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in Vietnamese), with pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish markings. They can be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets. If you have access to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star fruit (carambola), add them to the platter. You may select or substitute the ingredients according to availability and personal taste. 1 large head of Boston or other soft lettuce, separated into individual leaves, 1 bunch of scallions, cut into 2 inch lengths, 1 cup coriander leaves, 1 cup mint leaves, 1 cup fresh Asian or regular basil leaves, 1 cucumber, peeled in alternating strips, halved lengthwise and sliced thinly crosswise, 4 ounces fresh bean sprouts On a large platter, decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in separate groups. Use in recipes where required. Yield: 4 to 6 servings From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang. 1989. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; May 24 1993.

      <li>Finely Grated</li>
      <li>Apples, Mcintosh, Cortland,</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat the oven to 375 F. Lightly butter a roasting pan. 2. Combine the beef, pork, bread crumbs, onion, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Beat in the milk, ketchup, and seasonings and add to the meat. Mix with your hands just until well combined. (A wooden spoon won't do the job as well as your hands.) 3. Shape the meat into an oval loaf in the buttered roasting pan and bake until evenly browned, 50 minutes. 4. Combine the applesauce, apple cider, brown sugar, and heat over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. 5. Pour the applesauce mixture over the meat loaf, covering it well, and continue baking until the top is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Remove the meat loaf from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. Makes 6 to 8 entree servings. GINGERED APPLESAUCE 1. Place the lemon juice in a large saucepan. Peel, core, and cut each apple into eighths. As you add the apples to the pot, toss them to coat with the lemon juice to prevent discoloration. 2. Add 1/3 cup water, the sugar, and grated ginger and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the apples are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and mash coarsely with a fork. Taste and add more sugar if necessary. The applesauce should be be a bit chunky. VARIATIONS: APPLE-HORSERADISH SAUCE: Substitute 1/2 cup of freshly grated peeled horseradish for the ginger. If desired, add 2 cups mayonnaise. Great with roast beef. APPLESAUCE WITH FRESH FRUIT: Substitute 1/2 cup fresh or thawed frozen raspberries, peaches , or blueberries for the ginger, and stir in 2 Tbs brandy or sake. This is great with game or fowl. PASSION-APPLESAUCE: Omit the ginger. Just after you remove the pan from the heat, stir the pulp (seeds and all) of 2 passion fruits into the applesauce. This goes well with almost anything, especially grilled sausages, smoked pork chops, and venison. DESSERT APPLESAUCE: Puree the Gingered Applesauce then thin it with fresh apple cider to the desired consistency. Use it as a topping for ice cream, angel-food cake, or pound cake.

      <li>Wash and half Mac's and Winesap and cook until soft in as little water as possible. You can do this in pots on the stove (watch for burning) or in roasting pans in the oven. Even the microwave will do. Put through food mill and add brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg grated to taste. Add chopped delicious apples if you want chunky style. Heat to boiling, stiring occasionally. Pour boiling hot into hot jars leaving 1/2 inch head space. Remove air bubbles. Adjust caps. Process pints and quarts 20 minutes in a boiling water bath.

Add the solid and liquid ingredients and the yeast in order according to the machine's manufacturer. Be on hand to observe the first mixing cycle and add flour or water as needed as the moisture content of applesauce varies dramatically from batch to batch.

      <li>From: dijcks@ims-tc.ce.philips.nl ("Stephanie v. Dijck") Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 23:00:00 +0000 This is the Dutch way for making applesauce: Peel and cube apples (take centres out as well). But the pieces in a pan with a bit of water. Cook for about 20 minutes until everything is smooth, Put it through a blender or use a whisk to remove any lumps (this is optional). Let the stuff cool. Add sugar to taste. Variations: Add raisins, they will swell because of the juice in the apples. Add some rum. Add cinnamon. My personal favorite: add sugar and cinnamon before cooking. Leave a few (soft, small) lumps in. Eat steaming hot for dinner. Careful with the sugar! Applesauce sweetened when hot will almost always turn out too sweet once cooled down.

Stir together the flour, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor. Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the apple sauce and mix well. Gather into a ball. If dough is too wet, knead in a little flour. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/16 to 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares. Arrange on a baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn and continue baking for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until crisp. Cool on a rack. Yield: 50-55. VARIATION: If you want a sweeter cracker, sprinkle the tops with turbinado sugar. Roll the rolling pin lightly over the tops before cutting to press in the sugar. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>From: daughtry@qualcomm.com ("Vicki C. Daughtry") Date: Mon, 19 Sep 1994 23:00:00 +0000 This is a low-fat version I just made last night. Use 5-6 pounds of tart cooking apples such as pippins or Granny Smiths. Put 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice in a large pot. (Not an aluminum one.) Quarter, peel, and core apples. Put in pot. Cover. Cook on very low heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour (until apples turn to mush). You can use a potato masher on them if you want smooth applesauce. You can also stir in 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar at the end if you want it sweet. That's it. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /FRUIT From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>From: kmckinne@gov.nb.ca (Kevin McKinney) Date: Thu, 22 Sep 1994 22:27:00 +0000 My favorite way to make applesauce is in the microwave, as this retains all of the flavor and goodness of the fruit. Simply cut the fruit in half (or in quarters), place it in a 2 or 3 quart microwaveable corningware casserole, cover it, and microwave on high for 12 to 15 minutes. You might want to check for doneness periodically. When the apples are soft, let cool a bit, and then force through a ricer into a bowl. Sweeten to taste, depending on the apple variety, and season to taste with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and/or allspice. This freezes well in jam jars or plastic containers.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>DOUGH (ENOUGH FOR 2 STRUDELS):</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Hot water</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cider vinegar; preferably unrefined</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>8 cups Tart apples peeled; thin-sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Unsalted butter; melted</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped pecans; toasted</li>
      <li>1 cup Raisins</li>
      <li>1 cup Graham cracker or vanilla wafer crumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Crystallized ginger; minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make the dough: Place the butter in a bowl, and pour the hot water over it, stirring to melt the butter. Add the egg and the vinegar, and mix in well. Add 2 cups of the flour and the salt, and stir until a sticky dough forms. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup flour on a pastry board, and knead the dough on it for about 5 minutes, until the extra flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth and shiny. Divide the dough in half, flattening both portions into 4 or 5-inch rounds. Refrigerate or freeze one round for later use. The amount of remaining dough may not look like enough to encase the filling, but it will. Cover it, and let it sit in a warm place. Some cooks put it in a bowl set in a second bowl of warm water; others use a barely warmed skillet. Allowed to rest, the dough becomes soft and pliable. While the dough is resting, make the filling: Toss the apples with the butter in a large bowl. Add the remaining filling ingredients, and mix well. Get ready to stretch the dough: Clear a table, and cover it with a thin smooth-surfaced dish towel. Sprinkle the towel with flour. (The towel eventually helps support the paper-thin dough.) Plan to work quickly once you get going. Center the dough on the towel, and pat it out as thin as you can by hand. Then put your hands under the dough, and start stretching it out from the center. Some people prefer to use their fingertips for this; others use their knuckles. We start with our fingertips, switching to the knuckles when the dough is thinner and can tear more easily. To pull the dough evenly, you'll need either to turn the towel around periodically or to make your way around the table, whichever is easier. As the dough gets successively broader and thinner, you'll be able to tell where it still needs stretching by looking at it - if it's translucent, it's thin enough. Try to avoid tearing the dough, as it is difficult to patch. The edges will be thicker, but you can pull them thin or trim them off. You should end up with something resembling a rectangle at least 18 to 24 inches. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a baking sheet. Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Brush the dough, still resting on the towel, with about 2 tablespoons of it. Cover the dough completely with a single layer of the filling. Using the towel for support, begin rolling up one of the rectangle's longer sides jelly roll-style. If you ended up with tears in the dough concentrated in any one area, try to roll the strudel so that they will be hidden within it. Roll the strudel up snug, but don't make it extra tight, because it needs some room to expand while baking. Pinch it closed as you go to help hold in the juices. When the strudel is rolled up completely, use the towel to transfer it from the table to the baking sheet positioned nearby. Form the strudel into a horseshoe to fit on the sheet. Brush it with the remaining tablespoon of melted butter, and sprinkle it with the sugar. Bake the strudel for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue baking for an additional 25 to 30 minutes, until the pastry is lightly browned and just crisp. Let the strudel rest for at least 20 minutes before you cut it. Serve the strudel warm in thick slices.

      <li>Combine plums, apples and juice in a heavy non-aluminum saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover and cook until fruit is very tender, stirring stirring occasionally (20-30 minutes). Cool slightly. Force fruit through food mill fitted with medium blade, discarding peel and seeds. (or you can do as I do, seed and pit the fruit BEFORE cooking. Then, when you reach this stage, all you have to do is run it through a food processor) Return puree to pan, add sugar and cinnamon. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. (careful, mixture can scorch easily!) Reduce heat and simmer briskly until butter is thick and glossy, stirring frequently (about 40 minutes). Remove from heat, spoon into hot sterilized jars and seal. Makes 3 pints jars or 6 - 8oz jars. Butter can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 weeks, or processed in a boiling water bath (15 minutes for pint jars or 10 minutes for 8 oz jars) and kept on a cool dark shelf for up to 1 year.

      <li>1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 F. 2. To make the cake, combine the powdered sugar and cake flour. 3. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt until well mixed and soft peaks form. Beat in the sugar, a little at a time , and beat until stiff but not dry. With a rubber spatula, fold in the dry ingredients until the flour is just incorporated. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, shaking the pan lightly. 4. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top springs back when touched and is golden brown. Invert the pan onto a bottle or funnel and cool completely. 5. To assemble, using a serrated knife, cut the cake into three layers. Sprinkle each layer with some of the amaretto. Place one layer on a serving plate. Spread the pistachio ice cream on the bottom layer and top with the second layer. Spread the chocolate ice cream on the second layer and top with the third layer. Freeze the cake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until set. 6. Meanwhile, to make the topping, in a chilled bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the heavy cream and the remaining amaretto until it forms soft peaks. Spread on the top and sides of the cake. Return to the freezer. 7. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, over low heat, melt the chocolate chips, stirring until smooth.. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Pour the melted chocolate onto the prepared pan, spreading it 1/4 inch thick. Let chocolate set for 15 minutes. Using an oiled heart shaped cookie cutter, cut out hearts. Place them on top of the cake. Keep cake in the freezer until ready to serve. My notes: This was absolutely wonderful, however next time I am going to start with a boxed angel food cake mix. Also I had to let the chocolate set more than 15 minutes before I could cut it, I guess my house was too warm. And now that soda pop no longer comes in bottles and funnels are mostly plastice, I had a very hard time finding somewhere to invert the cake, finally I just used the full amaretto bottle.

    <title>Amy Scherber's Baguette</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>3 14</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cups (2 ounces) very warm water</li>
      <li>105 to 115 degrees F</li>
      <li>3 cups (13 1/2 ounces)</li>
      <li>Unbleached all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup (4 1/2 ounces) cake flour</li>
      <li>(see note)</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Plus 1 tablespoon, (10</li>
      <li>1/2ounces) cool water - 75</li>
      <li>Degrees F</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the yeast and the warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Combine the flours and salt in a large bowl. Pour the cool water and the yeast mixture over the flour, and mix with your fingers to form a shaggy mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and and resilient, but not too smooth at this point. Let the dough rest on the work surface for 20 minutes, covered with plastic wrap or a light towel. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes. Don't overknead it: The dough should be smooth, stretchy, and resilient. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it in the bowl to coat with oil, and cover it with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature ( 75 to 77 degrees F) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until nearly doubled in volume. Gently deflate the dough and fold it over itself in the bowl. Reshape it into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1 1/4 hours or until it has nearly doubled again. Gently deflate the dough again, reshape into a round, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour. Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface and divide it into 3 equal pieces (about 10 ounces each). Gently stretch one piece into a rectangle, leaving some large bubbles in the dough. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a log by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the baguette while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure. Set aside on the work surface to relax before elongating it, and repeat the shaping process with remaining pieces of dough. Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped, by rolling it back and forth on the work surface. Begin with both hands over the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the loaf reaches the desired length. (Don't get carried away, or the baguettes won't fit in your oven!) Place the finished loaves on a peel or upside down baking sheet lined with parchment paper spring, resulting in loaves with a light, airy crumb and more flared cuts. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place an empty water pan directly under the stone. Use a very sharp razor blade or lame to make 3 to 5 slashes, depending on the length of your loaves, on the top of each baguette. The cuts should run from one end of the loaf to the other, rather than across it, and the blade should be held at a 30 degree angle to the loaf so that the cuts pop open in the oven. Be careful not to press down too hard, or you may deflate the loaves. Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves. Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the baguette mold in the oven. Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and quickly close the oven door. After 1 minute, mist the loaves and oven walls 6 to 8 times and close the door. After 2 more minutes, spray the loaves and the oven walls again. Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer until the loaves are golden brown and crisp. Move them to a rack to cool. Enjoy your baguettes still slightly warm with some soft, ripe French cheese and a glass of wine. Yield: 3 - 14 inch loaves. Note: If cake flour is not available, you can use the same amount of unbleached all-purpose flour, but cake flour will give the baguette a lighter texture.

    <title>Amy Scherber's Big Beautiful White Pan Loaves</title>
    <category>Bread</category>
    <category>Tvfn</category>
    <quantity>1 2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 cups (2 oz) very warm water</li>
      <li>(105 degrees</li>
      <li>To 115 degrees F)</li>
      <li>1 3/4 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups (20 1/4 oz) unbleached</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Plus 2 tablespoons (11 oz)</li>
      <li>Cool water (75 degrees)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Equipment: 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, lightly oiled In a small measuring cup, mix the warm water and yeast with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture and the cool water. Using your fingers, mix the dough into a sticky mass. When all of the flour is incorporated, move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. The dough should be sticky and will not look smooth. If the dough feels stiff or dry, knead in additional cool water, a tablespoon at a time. Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover, and let rest for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Return the dough to the lightly floured surface and knead it for 7 to 8 minutes. The dough will go from being sticky to smooth and will become supple but not too firm. Place the dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not spring back.) Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough and pat it into a rectangle. The short sides should be the top and bottom edges. Fold the top edge down and the bottom edge up, overlapping them slightly, then turn the dough a quarter turn and fold the top down and the bottom up again to form an envelope. Shape the dough into a log shape by rolling the loaf down two to three times and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Roll the loaf back and forth on the table to smooth out. Place the loaf seam side down in a lightly oiled 9 by 5 inch loaf pan. Gently press down on the loaf to spread it to fill the corners of the pan, and cover it with oiled plastic wrap. Let the loaf rise at 75 degrees to 77 degrees F for about 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until it has doubled and risen about 1-inch above the edge of the pan. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Gently place the loaf pan on the center rack of the oven. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaf with water 6 to 8 times, then shut the oven door. After 3 minutes, mist the loaf again. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and bake for 30 minutes longer, or until the top is a deep golden brown. Remove the loaf from the pan it should come out with ease. The bread should sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom, and the sides of the loaf should be brown. Immediately place the loaf from the pan on a wire rack to cool. Serve slightly warm, with butter and lots of homemade jam!

    <quantity>24</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/4 pounds Lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Instant minced onion</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Garlic powder</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>3/8 teaspoons Red pepper; crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oregano</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Parsley flakes</li>
      <li>18 ounces Tomato paste; 3 (6-oz) cans</li>
      <li>24 ounces Tomato sauce; 3 (8-oz) cans</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups Hot water</li>
      <li>3 large Eggs; beaten</li>
      <li>3 pounds Cream style cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1 pound Lasagna noodles; cooked, (18 noodles)</li>
      <li>12 ounces Processed cheddar cheese; shredded</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served without freezing. Crumble beef; cook until lightly browned. Stir in onion. Cook until onion is tender. Drain off fat. Stir in seasonings, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. In another bowl, blend eggs with cottage cheese. In each pan, spread a layer of meat mixture (about 3/4 cup). Add a layer each of noodles (2 1/4), meat mixture (about 3/4 cup), cottage cheese mixture (about 3/4 cup), processed cheese (1/3 cup), and parmesan cheese (1 1/2 tablespoons). Repeat layers until all ingredients are used. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets. TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING: Preheat oven to 400ø F. (hot). Bake 30 minutes or until sauce bubbles at edges. TO FREEZE: Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze for 10-12 hours before removing packages from the pans. TO HEAT FROZEN LASAGNA: Preheat oven to 400ø F. (hot). Remove freezer wrap. Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until sauce bubbles at edges and center is hot. VARIATION: Italian Lasagna -- Use ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese and mozarella cheese in place of processed cheddar cheese.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Jalapeno peppers; peeled, cut into narrow strips</li>
      <li>1 cup (I use Basmati) rice</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk (up to)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Half and half</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Joel.Ehrlich@salata.com (Joel Ehrlich) Date: 20 Jul 96 04:57:51 -0800 Hi! I was making Amparo's rice and it suddenly occurred to me that you would probably really enjoy it. That is assuming I am right that you are one of the chili-heads? I am not on the list and I doubt that this recipe has made it there (possible tho - my brother is on the net and he should be on the list). Anyway, here it is. If you like, pass it on the list. It is probably not as hot as some of you like but substitute hotter peppers or skim milk for some of the cream and it will heat up. As it is, I use 1 pepper and, if I want it really mild, I skip the peeling process and just core it. As a side note, today I used 2 old sandwich bags instead of gloves, one became the garbage sack and the other is now in the freezer with 3 small strips of pepper for next week's stir fry. (Bahia de Kino, Sonora, Mexico) Peel and core 1 to 2 jalapeno peppers. Cut pepper into narrow strips. Place on top of 1 cup (I use Basmati) rice in a star pattern. Add 1 cup milk and 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of half and half. Salt to taste. Bake for about 1 hour at 350 degrees or until milk is gone and rice is soft. Serve hot.

      <li>1/4 cups (2 ounces) very warm water</li>
      <li>(105 to 115 degrees F)</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cups Or more if necessary (18 1/2</li>

      <li>2 1/2 cups (20 ounces) cool water ( 75</li>
      <li>Degrees F)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) honey</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces ) molasses</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) Canola oil (or</li>
      <li>Other vegetable oil)</li>

      <li>Toasted</li>
      <li>Additional rolled oats for</li>
      <li>Topping</li>
      <li>Two 9 by 5-inch loaf pans, oiled</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for about 3 minutes. Whisk the whole wheat flour, unbleached flour, oats, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the sponge starter, cool water, honey, molasses, and oil to the yeast mixture. Mix with your fingers for 1 to 2 minutes, just long enough to break up the sponge (the mixture should look milky and be slightly foamy). Add the flour mixture to the bowl and stir with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Don't be concerned if the dough feels very sticky at this point. Lightly flour a work surface. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, until it becomes compact and elastic. It should be very moist but not mushy. If it feels too stiff to knead, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have a soft, malleable dough. If it's sloppy wet and impossible to knead, add another 1/4 to 1/3 cup (1 1/4 to 1 2/3 ounces) of whole wheat flour. Shape the dough into a loose ball and let it rest, covered with plastic wrap, on the lightly floured work surface for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Flatten the dough and stretch it gently into a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the pecans and raisins evenly over the dough. Fold the whole mass into an envelope and knead and fold it gently until the nuts are well distributed, about 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading. Some of the nuts may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise, when the dough has softened. Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, along with any loose nuts. Turn the dough to coat the top with oil, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (You can also refrigerate this dough overnight and shape it and bake it the next day: Let it rise for 1 hour at room temperature, or until it looks slightly puffy but not doubled, before refrigerating. The next day, let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature before shaping it.) When the dough has doubled, loosen it from the bowl with lightly floured hands and gently pour it onto a floured work surface. Press any loose pecans into the dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a log. Spread the oats for topping on a flat plate or baking sheet. Use a pastry brush or a plant sprayer to lightly moisten the top of each log with water, then roll the tops of the loaves in the oats. Place each loaf seam side down in an oiled 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Cover them with plastic wrap and allow to rise for about 2 hours, or until they have doubled in size (a finger pressed into the dough will leave an indentation). Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone. When the loaves have doubled, place the pans on the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the door. After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves quickly 6 to 8 times then shut the oven door. Repeat the misting procedure 1 minute later. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tipped out of the pan and tapped on the bottom. The sides and bottom of the loaf should feel firm and slightly crusty. If the tops are browned but the sides are still somewhat soft, place the loaves directly on the stone to bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer. Transfer the loaves from the pans to a rack and allow to cool completely before slicing. continued in part 2 Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #230 by Bill &lt;thelma@pipeline.com&gt; on Sep 11, 1997</li>

    <title>Amish Friendship Dough Starter (Aka Herman)</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 package Dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Warm water</li>
      <li>2 cups Luke warm water</li>
      <li>2 cups Sifted flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the following in a NON METAL BOWL WITH NON METAL UTENSILS!!!!!!! Mix the yeast and the first 1/2 c water together and let stand until "yeasty". Then sift the dry stuff together, and combine it with the yeast/water and the other 2 c of luke warm water. Mix well with a non-metal spoon and let stand uncovered at room temp for 3-5 days, covering only at night, and stirring 2-3 times a day. Remove 1 cup and start the ten day ritual, as below. With the remaining mix, add 1/2 c water, 1/2 c flour, and 1 t sugar. Let stand at room temp one day (until very bubbly). Store covered in fridge for up to 10 days for in recipes or as further starter. 10-day ritual (all done at room temp in non-metal bowl) Day 1--you receive "Herman" and do nothing Day 2--stir w/non metal (pref. wooden) spoon Day 3--stir Day 4--stir Day 5--add 1 c each of flour, sugar, and milk. Stir Day 6--stir Day 7--stir Day 8--stir Day 9--stir Day 10--"Herman is born!" Add 1 c each of flour, sugar, and milk. Stir well. Pour 1 C each into 3 containers. Give to friends/enemies with above instructions. Reserve one cup for reprocessing for yourself. The friend who gave me this starter recipe controls her batch by only adding 1/3 c of each ingredient on days 5 and 10. You can do this to prevent yourself from becoming overrun! The bread recipe below is a good solution to the starter, but you end up 50 lbs overweight and have a freezer full of loaves unless you learn to control the "Herman" or pass it on to friends. Amish Friendship Bread To Remaining Batch of "Herman" (after you remove the 3 cups and restart or pass them on) add the following. Remaining Herman 2/3 c oil 3 eggs 1 c nut/fruit of choice (applesauce, bananas, etc) 2 c flour 1 1/2 t baking powder 1 c sugar 3/4 salt 1/2 t soda 1 t cinnamon Mix well and bake at 350 45-50 min. Makes 2 loaves. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip</li>

    <title>Amy Scherber's Big Beautiful Cinnamon Raisin Bread</title>
    <category>Bread</category>
    <category>Tvfn</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (7.5 ounces) dark raisins</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Unbleached all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 Big Beautiful White Pan</li>
      <li>Loaf Dough (1 batch</li>
      <li>See Recipe)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Equipment: One 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, oiled or buttered Mix one batch of the White Pan Loaf dough according to instructions given in recipe. Place the just mixed dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 degrees to 77 degrees F) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not spring back.) While the dough is rising, place the raisins in a bowl or a plastic container and fill with warm water to come just below the top of the raisins. (If you use too much water, you will rinse away the natural sweetness of the raisins.) Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough and pat it into a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick, and about 6 inches by 12 inches in size. The short sides should be the top and bottom edges. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle it evenly over the dough. Drain the raisins and toss them with the remaining 2 tablespoons flour. Spread the raisins evenly over the dough and gently press them into it. Starting at a short side, roll the dough into a log. Roll the dough tightly, keeping the skin of the dough slightly taut, and tucking in any raisins that fall out, but don't stretch the dough so tight that the skin tears. Seal the seam of the log gently but tightly using the heel of your hand against the surface of the table, or pinch it shut with your fingers. Place the loaf in an oiled or buttered 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, and cover with oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the loaf has risen almost 1 inch above the sides of the pans. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the loaf pan on the center oven rack. Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaf 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Spray the bread again after 2 minutes. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is deep brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. The crust may color quickly because of the cinnamon and raisins in the dough; watch carefully and cover the top of the loaf loosely with foil if it is browning too fast. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove the bread from the pan and place the loaf on a rack to cool. Let cool completely before slicing, or the bread will fall apart. This bread keeps well for at least 2 days.

      <li>From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva) Date: Tue, 3 Aug 93 15:26:15 CDT In a small bowl, soften yeast in water for 10 minutes. Stir well. In a 2- quart bowl, combine flour and sugar. Mix thoroughly or the flour will lump when the milk is added. Slowly stir in warm milk and softened yeast mixture. Cover loosely and let stand at room temperature until bubbly. Refigerate. Consider this day 1 of the 10 day cycle. Day 2 through 4: Stir with a spoon (any kind) Day 5 To feed, blend flour and sugar in a small bowl; slowly mix in milk with a spoon,whisk or hand mixer. Stir mixture into starter. Return to refrigerator. Day 6 through 9: Stir Day 10 ( which becomes Day 1 for the next series) Feed again. Note: Consider the 10-day cycle a guide; it does not have to be followed exactly. If you need more starter, feed it more often. The starter is a yeast culture and will grow when fed. To hasten growth, leave starter at room temp for several hours. After feeding the starter, Choose from among the following: 1. Return starter to refrigerator. 2. Remove what you need for baking and leave it at room temperature until very bubbly. Return remainder to refrig- erator and continue to follow the 10-day cycle. If yoy are getting to much, cut the "food" in half on one feeding. Don't let starter drop below 1 cup, because rejuvenating it to usable amounts takes several days. 3. Measure out 1 cup lots to give to friends or put in the freezer. 4. Frozen starter takes at least 3 hours at room temperature to thaw and come to life. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CAKES TAKES 10 DAYS From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>1 cup Sugar; (scant)</li>
      <li>3 Eggs; room temperature</li>
      <li>6 Egg yolks; room temperature</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Maraschino liqueur or 1/2 tsp almond extract; (up to 4)</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Plus 1 tbs sifted all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Plus 1 tbs yellow cornmeal; plus additional for pans</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Confectioner's sugar; optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Amor Polenta (Cornmeal Cake) will be the sweet ending to our Valentine's Day Dinner. I can't resist this cake. It's simple, but rich like a fine pound cake with the subtle flavor and crunch of cornmeal. So forget about the calories and cholesterol and celebrate the "day of amour" with Amor Polenta. from "The Italian Baker" by Carol Field Cream the butter and cup of sugar with a whisk, if you have one, of an electric mixer until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes at medium speed. Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. The batter should be lemony yellow. Stir in the liqueur. Sift the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together and fold into the batter, smoothing out any lumps but taking care not to deflate the batter. Butter 2 rehrucken (saddle of venison) pans (I use one 9x5 loaf pan...honestly, how many of us have a rehrucken pan just waiting to be used :-) and coat with cornmeal. Pour the batter into the 2 (or one) prepared pan(s). Place in a preheated 375 degree oven and bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on rack and unmold while cake is still slightly warm. Sift confectioner's sugar on top, if desired. In the summertime I like to serve a slice of this cake with fresh strawberries that have marinated in sugar and balsamic vinegar (approximately 1 pint of sliced strawberries mixed with 3 tbs sugar and 1 tbs balsamic vinegar) and a big dollop of cool whip (yes, I know...it's not REAL whipped cream, but I like it anyway!). My husband loves raspberries and I am a chocoholic so for Valentine's Day I am going to place a slice of cake on a pool of raspberry sauce (frozen raspberries, thawed and then placed in the blender with sugar and lemon juice to taste and then strained to remove seeds). A dollop of cool whip and a piece of Godiva chocolate on the side will complete this lovely desert. Posted to KitMailbox Digest by ehgf@primenet.com (Ellen) on Feb 11, 1998</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Icing sugar; sifted</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Egg whites (1/4 c = 2 whites</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes: 30 Cooking time: 20 minutes Oven temperature: 160 C (325 F) Blend ground almonds with icing sugar measured after sifting. Add lightly beaten egg whites with lemon rind if used and almond essence. Mix to a firm dough with hands. Clean hands and rub with a little butter to prevent dough sticking while shaping. Break off small pieces of dough the size of a walnut and form into pear shapes. Insert a whole clove in the top of each to resemble a stem and place upright on a buttered and floured baking sheet. Bake in a moderately slow oven for 20 minutes, covering with brown paper if tops begin to brown. Sift 2 cups icing sugar into a bowl and dip hot Amigthalota into it. If desired, a little rose or orange flower water may be brushed onto Amigthalota before dipping into icing sugar. Place on a wire rack to cool. Sift remaining sugar from bowl into base of a container and arrange cooled Almond Pears upright in a single layer. Sift more sugar thickly over tops and sides, seal and store for a day or two before using.

      <li>2 1/2 cups Homemade Chicken Broth =OR=- canned broth</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. On 2 cookie sheets, toast the bread cubes for 15 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Transfer to a very large mixer bowl. Bone the chicken and very finely chop the meat, discarding the skin. (I do this in the food processor while chicken is still warm.) Add the chopped vegetables and chicken meat to the bread, along with the seasonings. Toss. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs; add the evaporated milk and broth. Pour over the bread mixture and blend. The mixture will be quite moist. Allow to stand 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 F. Transfer the dressing to an oiled 3 quart glass casserole that is 10 inches in diameter and 3 inches deep (at this point, dressing can be frozen for future use; thaw before baking.) Bake dressing for 2 hours, or until the center of the dressing puffs up and is golden brown on top. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Enjoy! Amy didn't mention pre-cooking the onions so I don't know if she does, but it probably wouldn't be a bad idea.

      <li>3 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The following is a Sugar Pie recipe that came from Northern Indiana and is an old Amish recipe. It is very, very good - and different. Preheat oven to 350F. In a small bowl blend together the sugar, flour and salt. Spread in bottom of pie shell. Pour the milk over the sugar mixture, but do not stir. Dot with the butter and sprinkle cinnamon over all. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until filling bubbles in center. This will not be a firm custard, so don't despair if it doesn't look like the custard pies you are accustomed to! Pie is best served at room temperature.JM.

    <title>Amy Scherber's Crusty Italian Loaf</title>
    <category>Bread</category>
    <quantity>3</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cups (2 ounces) very warm</li>
      <li>Water(105 to 115 degrees F)</li>
      <li>1 cup (8 ounces)cool water ( 75</li>
      <li>Degrees F)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) Sponge Starter</li>
      <li>(recipe follows)</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups (16 ounces) unbleached</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Plus 1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>A sponge starter bread Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Add the cool water and sponge to the yeast mixture and mix with your fingers for about 2 minutes, breaking up the sponge. The mixture should look milky and slightly foamy. Add the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers into a mass. It will be wet and sticky, with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers. If the dough is not sticky, add 1 tablespoon of water. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes supple and fairly smooth. This is a sticky, wet dough; don't be tempted to add more flour to the work surface. Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the dough from the table during kneading. Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes, until it is stretchy and smooth, yet still slightly sticky. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for about 1 hour, or until the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or preferably, overnight to let it relax, develop flavor, and become more manageable. Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it begins to warm up and starts to rise. Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it. Divide the dough into three equal pieces, about 13 ounces each. Gently flatten one piece, pressing out some of the air bubbles, and stretch it into a rectangle. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure. Do not elongate. These loaves are about 10 inches long. Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and place the loaf, seam side down, on the flour. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. The loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in shape. Leave plenty of space between the loaves they will spread as they rise. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 1 2 hours, until bubbly and loose. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone. Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal. Line an upside-down baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with cornmeal. Lift one loaf, flip it over so the floured side is on top, and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of the peel, or about 14 inches on a pan. Repeat with the remaining loaves, placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan. Dimple each loaf with your finger in about 6 places, but don't deflate them too much. Be sure the loaves are loosened from the peel, then carefully slide them onto the baking stone. Place the pan of bread on the rack below the stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaves with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist the loaves again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later. Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not brown enough, the loaves will soften as they cool.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.

    <quantity>12 2.5</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cups (2 ounces) very warm water</li>
      <li>(105 to 115 degrees F)</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Plus 1/4 teaspoon (2 ounces)</li>
      <li>Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3 cups Plus 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>(14 ounces) unbleached</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (8 ounces) warm brewed</li>
      <li>Coffee (90 degrees F)</li>
      <li>1 large Egg yolk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2/3 cups (4 ounces) chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1/2 cups (4 ounces) cold water</li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons Cornstarch</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Two 12 by 17-inch baking sheets, lined with parchment paper Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl. Stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast and allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Whisk the unbleached flour, cocoa powder, the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and the salt together in a medium bowl. Set them aside. Using your hand, stir the coffee, the egg yolk, and the butter into the dissolved yeast. Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring until a shaggy mass forms and all of the flour is moistened. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 7 to 8 minutes, until it is silky smooth and elastic. This dough should be nice and moist, so add flour sparingly as you work. Shape the dough into a loose ball cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for about 10 minutes to relax the gluten strands. Flatten the dough and stretch it gently with your fingers to form a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the peanut butter chips evenly over the rectangle. Fold the dough into an envelope and knead gently for 2 to 3 minutes, until the chips are well distributed. The dough should be soft, smooth, and springy. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading it. Some of the chips may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise when the dough has softened. Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Turn to coat the top of the dough with oil, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until the dough has doubled in volume, about 2 hours. Line two 12 by 17-inch baking sheets with parchment paper. Gently pour the dough onto the floured work surface pressing any loose chocolate chips into dough. Flour your hands lightly divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces). Shape the pieces into rolls and place 6 on each prepared baking sheet leaving several inches between the rolls so they won't grow together as they rise. Cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let them rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. While the bread is proofing make a cornstarch wash: Put the cold water in a small saucepan and whisk in the cornstarch. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently until it thickens. Remove from the heat and cover to keep a skin from forming. Set aside to cool. About 15 minutes before you're ready to bake, place one oven rack in the top third of the oven, and another in the bottom third, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. When the buns have doubled, use a pastry brush to paint them with a thin coating of the cornstarch wash. Brush gently so you don't deflate them. Place one pan on each oven rack. Using a plant sprayer, immediately mist the top and sides of the oven 6 to 8 times and quickly close the oven door. Repeat this misting procedure two more times at 1-mintue intervals. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and rotate the pans from top to bottom and front to back to ensure even baking. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until the tops of the buns feel firm but not hard when you press them slightly, and the bottoms are very lightly browned. These rolls should have a thin soft covering, not a hard crunchy crust. Remove from the oven and use the pastry brush to paint the top of each bun quickly and evenly with the cornstarch wash. Transfer the rolls to a rack and allow them to cool before serving. These are best eaten the day they are baked.

    <ingredient>
      <li>6 Flour tortillas; (10")</li>
      <li>2 packages Cream cheese; softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Salsa</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chopped green chilis; (canned)</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Sliced turkey</li>
      <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>Avocado; sliced thin</li>
      <li>Tomato; sliced thin</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Add salsa and green chilis to cream cheese. Mixture should be salmon pink and chunky, but not runny. Spread mixture on a tortilla thinly, about 1/4" thick, covering the entire tortilla. On on side only, lay a slice of turkey to cover about 1/3 of the tortilla. Add a leaf of lettuce over the turkey, then a row of avocado slices (end to end from north to south) and tomato slices. Beginning from the side covered with the turkey and other ingredients, carefully roll tightly, jellyroll fashion. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours, up to overnight if they're left whole. Continue with the rest of the tortillas. Before serving, slice into 1/2" pieces. This concept is incredibly versatile. Flavor the cream cheese with a complementary flavor to the filling you choose. E.g., pesto cream cheese with provolone slices, sundried tomatos and pine nuts; horseradish cream cheese with roast beef, tomatoes and lettuce. Formatted by Lynn Thomas dcqp82a@prodigy.com. Recipe from Amy Sallin amysis@hotmail.com. Lynn's notes: Made this 9-25-97; used 8 sun-dried tomato halves, minced; 1/3 c. toasted chopped pine nuts; 2 tbsp. jalapeno pepper jelly; 1/3 cup chopped green onion--green part only. Omitted avocado and tomato and used thin sliced turkey and chicken. Next time I'll add cheese. This was easy to make, I did it early in the day, and it tasted great.

    <title>Amish Tomato Ketchup</title>
    <category>Canning</category>

    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 Celery ribs; trimmed cut in 1/4" thick slices</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions (abt. 2 cups) peeled and diced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups ;Water</li>
      <li>3 pounds Tomatoes; quartered</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup Dark brown sugar; packed</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoons Allspice berries</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoons Whole cloves</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoons Celery seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground mace</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the celery, onions and water in a medium-size saucepan over medium high heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are nearly soft, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, cook tomatoes in a large heavy nonreactive saucepan over medium heat, partially covered, until they are very soft and almost a puree, about 25 minutes. Add the cooked celery and onions; continue cooking until the vegetables are completely softened, about 15 minutes. Strain tomato mixture in small batches through a sieve into another nonreactive saucepan, pressing down firmly to extract all of the liquid. Stir in the vinegar, brown sugar and spices. Place the pan over medium high heat and bring to a boil. Continue boiling, stirring often to be sure that the ketchup isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the mixture thickens somewhat, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow ketchup to cool, then ladle into jars. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 months. Or ladle the boiling-hot ketchup into hot sterilized canning jars. Seal according to the lid manufacturer's instructions. Yield: 1 1/2 pints. Loomis writes: "This sweet ketchup comes from Mary Linebach, who owns and runs a produce auction with her [Mennonite] husband, Paul, in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania." [Mary describes the ketchup by saying]: 'The children love it on pancakes...It's sweeter than store-bought and not as tangy...' "The ketchup is good on morning hotcakes (an Amish custom) as it is on Cheddar cheese sandwiches, as a dip for fresh vegetables or freshly baked bread, and as a condiment with roast or fried meat or poultry. And it has one distinct advantage over the most popular store-bought brand: You won't have any trouble getting it out of the bottle, because it's not thick."

    <title>Amy's Crusty Italian Loaf Pt 1</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <category>Italian</category>
    <quantity>3</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 cups Very warm water; (105 to 115 degrees)</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup Cool water; ( 75 degrees)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sponge Starter; recipe follows</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Unbleached allpurpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Plus 1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Add the cool water and sponge starter to the yeast mixture and mix with your fingers for about 2 minutes, breaking up the sponge. The mixture should look milky and slightly foamy. Add the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers into a mass. It will be wet and sticky, with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers. If the dough is not sticky, add 1 tablespoon of water. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes supple and fairly smooth. This is a sticky, wet dough; don't be tempted to add more flour to the work surface. Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the dough from the table during kneading. Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes, until it is stretchy and smooth, yet still slightly sticky. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for about 1 hour, or until the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or preferably, overnight to let it relax, develop flavor, and become more manageable. Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it begins to warm up and starts to rise. Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it. Divide the dough into three equal pieces, about 13 ounces each. Gently flatten one piece, pressing out some of the air bubbles, and stretch it into a rectangle. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure. Do not elongate. These loaves are about 10 inches long. Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and place the loaf, seam side down, on the flour. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. The loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in shape. Leave plenty of space between the loavesthey will spread as they rise. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours, until bubbly and loose. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone. Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal. Line an upside down baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with cornmeal. Lift one loaf, flip it over so the floured side is on top, and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of the peel, or about 14 inches on a pan. Repeat with the remaining loaves, placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan. Dimple each loaf with your finger in about 6 places, but don't deflate them too much. Be sure the loaves are loosened continued in part 2</li>

      <li>Toasted</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Plus 1 tablespoon (2 1/2</li>
      <li>Ounces) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Equipment: One 9-inch square baking pan, preferably non-stick, buttered on sides only; one sheet pan, lined with aluminum foil Place the yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the warm water and the yeast mixture and stir with your fingers to moisten the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5 minutes. This is a soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff and hard to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you get a nice malleable dough. Gently shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1to 2 more minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too firm. The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the top with oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F)until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9 tablespoons butter and the dark brown sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter has melted and the sugar is completely moistened (it won't be dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky and a little lighter in color. Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease the sides of a 9-inch square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting the pan slightly so the mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the warm caramel and press them down slightly. Put the pan in the refrigerator to cool the caramel; be the pan's on a level surface. Put the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until evenly mixed. Set aside. When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the floured work surface. Flatten the dough and stretch it with your fingers to form a 13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a long side facing you. Work gently so you don't tear the dough surface. The dough should stretch easily at this point, but if it resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and resume stretching. Check to be sure the dough isn't sticking to the work surface; flour the table again, if necessary. Spread 3 tablespoons of the softened butter evenly over the the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch strip unbuttered along the top edge. Sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture generously and evenly over the butter, again leaving the top 1/2-inch of the rectangle bare. Starting with the bottom edge, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If the dough sticks to the table as you're rolling, use a dough scraper to loosen it gently. Pinch gently but firmly along the seam to seal it. If necessary, gently shape the roll so it is a nice uniform log. Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator. Cut the log of dough into 9 equal pieces. (It's easiest to mark the roll first to show where you're going to make the cuts--a slight indentation with the knife edge will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut completely through the dough.) Lay the pieces cut side down on top of the caramel. Don't worry if it's a tight fit. Let rise, uncovered, at room temperature until the dough has almost doubled, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. The rolls should fill the pan and extend 1/2 to 3/4-inch above it. In the meantime, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the pan of sticky buns on a foil-lined baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of the buns are golden brown and crusty. It's important to bake the buns long enough so the dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel topping develops properly. Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then quickly but carefully turn the pan upsidedown and release the sticky buns onto a large flat heatproof plate. Immediately scrape out any caramel remaining and spread it on top of the buns, filling in any bare spots. Let them cool until just warm before serving.

      <li>From: john harris &lt;jbird21@owb.mindspring.com&gt; Date: Mon, 05 Aug 1996 06:44:43 -0400 DO NOT USE METAL SPOON OR BOWL AND DO NOT REFRIGERATE STARTER MIX! This is a fermented process. The batter will expand during fermenting. The use of metal utinsils or bowls will spoil the fermenting process. STARTER: 1c. flour, 1c. milk, 1c. sugar, mix well with wooden spoon. (if a friend has given you a jar of starter mix, you do not need to make the above starter mix. Just begin with "Day 1".) Day 1: Do Nothing. Day 2: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 3: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 4: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 5: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 6: Add, 1c. flour, 1c. milk, 1c. sugar, mix well with wooden spoon. Day 7: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 8: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 9: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 10: Add, 1c. flour, 1c. milk, 1c. sugar, mix well and pour into 3 separate jars. Give two jars of starter to friends with this recipe. Keep the third jar to bake the following: In a large bowl, add 1c. oil, 1/2 c. milk, 3 eggs, 1 ts vanilla, and mix thoroughly. In a separate bowl, mix 2 c. flour, 1 c. sugar, 1 1/2 ts baking powder, 2 ts cinnamon, 1/2 ts salt, 1/2 ts baking soda, 1 c. chopped pecans, 1 small box Instant Vanilla Pudding and mix well. Add dry indredients to wet ingredients and mix thoroughly. Grease 2 loaf pans and sprinkle with a Sugar/Cinnamon mix. Pour batter into loaf pans and sprinkle some extra Sugar/Cinnamon on top. Bake in 325 degree oven for one hour. Cool and remove from pans. This is sinfully delicious................ MC-Recipe Digest V1 #184 From the MasterCook recipe list.

Stir in remaining warm water, flour and sugar. Beat until smooth. Cover with loose fitting cover. DO NOT REFRIGERATE! The starter requires 10 days for fermentation as follows: DAYS 1, 2, 3 and 4: Stir batter DAY 5: Add 1 cup each milk, flour, sugar and stir DAYS 6, 7, and 8: Stir batter each day DAY 10: Add 1 cup each flour, sugar, milk; stir. The batter is ready to use. This makes 3 cups batter to use in the recipes. If you want to you may put 1 cup batter each into 3 containers and give 1 or 2 away. Save 1 cup to begin process all over again OR you can use all 3 cups batter for the recipes at 1 time and when you want to bake these again just start the starter again.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar (to start, and depending on dryness of wine)</li>
      <li>2 Sticks cinnamon (may break into pieces if desired)</li>
      <li>20 Whole allspice</li>
      <li>25 Whole cloves (up to 30)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dried orange peel (lemon peel optional)</li>
      <li>1 Whole orange, sliced (or lemon if desired)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the wine over low-medium heat in a non-metal container (I use a Corningware casserole which is rangetop safe). Do NOT allow it to heat too fast, and God forbid it should boil. When it's starting to get hot, stir in the sugar gradually, stirring until dissolved. Turn off the heat whenever you think it is hot enough (some amount hotter than the temperature at which you intend to serve it, since it's going to sit for a while). Place the spices in a cheesecloth bag and add them. Cover the pot and let steep for however long you wish. (I like 15 minutes). Remove the spices, add sliced citrus and serve with a non-metal ladle or dipper (if you don't take out the spices, subsequent servings will have a stronger spice taste).

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Dried Anasazi or pinto beans</li>
      <li>10 Coriander seeds</li>
      <li>8 Juniper berries</li>
      <li>1 small Noion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sunflower seed or light olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground red chile (opt)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried Mexican or Greek oregano</li>
      <li>2 1/2 quarts Water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Uncomplicated and satisfying, this recipe for anasazi beans is from Deborah Madison's "The Savory Way." You can find juniper berries in the spice section of specialty food markets. Sort through the beans, rinse them well, cover them with cold water, and set them aside for six hours or overnight. (Or use the quick-soaking method.) Bruise the seeds and berries in a mortar, and chop the onion into small squares. Warm the oil in a wide-bottomed soup pot; add the onions, coriander seeds, juniper berries, chile and oregano. Cook together over medium heat for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the fresh water. Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer for 40 minutes. Add salt to taste and continue cooking until the beans are as tender as you like them ~ probably another 30 minutes or so. When done, check the seasoning. Serve the beans in a bowl with the broth. Suggestion: There are lots of tasty additions you can use - cilantro, mint, scallions, sour cream, cheese and so on. But try the beans plain first. Nutritional analysis per serving: 401 calories, 4.84 grams fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 27.6 milligrams sodium; 11 percent of calories form fat.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Blackened garlic, lentils, and pasta was one of Bob Calderone's favorite combinations when he was a boy. Calderone, chef-owner of Anago in the Lenox Hotel, now turns the combination into a bisque. Here is an adaptation of his recipe. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, turning often, until charred, about 5 minutes. Put in the onion and cook for an additional 4 minutes or until lightly browned. Add the tomatoe paste and wine, and cook while stirring until the tomato paste dissolves and the wine bubbles. Add the lentils and chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 45 minutes or until the lentils are tender. Add more stock or water to keep the lentils covered. Remove from the heat and, when cool enough to handle, puree in batches in a processor. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, bring the soup to a gentle simmer. Stir in the cream and more stock or water if it is too thick and heat thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper, and garnish with chopped tomatoes and Italian parsley, if desired.

      <li>This is supposed to be the REAL Buffalo Wing recipe from the Anchor Bar in Buffalo. The Sauce This makes enough for about 30 "wingettes". Mix all the ingredients in a small sauce pan over low heat until the margarine is completely melted. Stir occasionally. The Wings Fry the wings in a deep fryer set at 375 degrees F., using vegetable or peanut oil. I fry 15 wings at a time for 12-15 minutes. Drain the wings for a few minutes then put them in a bowl. After all the wings have been fried, pour the sauce over them, cover the bowl, and shake to completely coat the wings. They can be eaten now, or you can put them on a baking sheet and bake them for a few minutes to get an extra-crispy coating. Serve with carrot and celery sticks, Marie's Bleu Cheese Dressing, and cold beer (Genee Cream Ale is traditional). ** (FRANK'S, now Durkee's) Recipe By : From: Ladies Home Journal- August 1991 File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

      <li>Toast the chiles directly over a medium gas flame or in a cast-iron skilliet until soft and brown, turning frequently to avoid scorching. Slice the chiles into 1-inch strips, then into a very fine julienne. Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl, mix well and let sit at least 30 minutes or as long as 2 hours before serving. Ancho salsa keeps a few days in the refrigerator. SOURCE: Mesa Mexicana, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger with Helena Siegel.

      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE TOPPING</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Lightly rosasted Macadamias whole or chopped (about 2 oz.)</li>
      <li>4 ounces Semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Whipping cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>[Note: Bobby Flay, chef of NYC's Mesa Grill, prepared this dessert for a Meals on Wheels benefit meal at the Frontera Grill in Chicago. Blended with the cocoa and coffee, the chili powder is only mildly hot and adds something approximating a fruit flavor.] 1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 9" square cake pan, line the bottom with parchment or waxed paper and butter the paper. Measure out cake flour, cocoa, chili powder, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and cayenne. Sift them together 3 times. 2. Using an electric mixer with a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and continue beating until mixture is light, fluffy and almost tripled in volume. 3. Fold 1/3 dry mixture into the butter-egg mixture, then add 1/2 the buttermilk and 1/2 the coffee. Fold in another 1/3 of the dry mixture then the remaining buttermilk and coffee. Finish with the remaining dry dry mixture and the vanilla extract. 4. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Bake until cake springs back when touched lightly (30 - 35 min.). Then turn out of pan and leave on the rack until completely cool. 5. Use a 2-1/2 inch cookie cutter to cut rounds from the cake. Place the rounds in paper cupcake liners. 6. Make the topping: If the macadamias are raw, roast them in a 350 degree oven, turning once, until they just begin to color. Place the chopped chocolate in a bowl, heat the whipping cream tii the point of a bowl and pour it over the chocolate. Let cool to warm then drizzle it over the cupcakes. Top with macadamia nuts. [Note: Ancho chili powder can be made by stemming and seeding whole ancho chilies and pulverizing them in an electric spice mill or coffee grinder. The poweder should be available at markets featuring Soutwestern ingredients or may be ordered by mail from G.B. Ratto &amp; Co., 800-325-3483.] From Chicago Tribune Magazine 3/23/93.

      <li>Date: Fri, 8 Mar 1996 14:44:40 -0600 (CST) From: Chris Kaufman &lt;kaufman@biosci.cbs.umn.edu&gt; In my typical prompt and timely manner I've wrangled some recipes from the Minneapolis Hotluck participants and am finally posting them for your pleasure. From: Alison and John Krufka. (I got this recipe from Minnesota Public Radio's "The Splendid Table") This marinade is warm and flavorable, but not hot. It should work well with chicken, seafood, prok [and euks!] and vegtables for grilling, braising or sauteing. It should keep about 1 month in the Frig. Makes about 1 cup. In a heavy skillet over medium heat toast the cumin and coriander about 5 minutes, or until aromatic. Grind to a powder in a coffee mill or with a morter and pestle. Add onion, garlic, and chilies to pan, roasting chilies 3 to 5 minutes until aromatic. Remove immediately. Take onion slices to golden and garlic to slightley softened, about 10 minutes. Stem and seed chilies, then cover with hot water and let soak 30 minutes. Meanwhile toast the cinnamon, pepper and orange zest 10 seconds over medium heat. Combine all ingredients in a blender (peeling garlic first), including chilies and a few tablespoons of their liquid. Puree, season to taste, and refrigerate until needed. Marinate larger pieces of meat or poultry from several hours to overnight. Fish needs only an hour or so while vegetables are ready to cook within the hour. Always refrigerate marinating foods.

    <category>Bread</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 Recipe baguette dough</li>
      <li>1/3 cups (3 ounces) sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1/4 cups (2 ounces) poppy seeds</li>
      <li>2 Or 3 tablespoons extra</li>
      <li>Virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Kosher salt for sprinkling</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the baguette dough using the instructions in the recipe. Divide the dough in half and use the other half for baguettes. Dust your work surface with flour and place the kneaded dough on the floured surface. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and allow it to rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for 1 hour. The dough will be soft but will not have doubled. Combine the sesame and poppy seeds in a small bowl. Pat the dough into an even 4 by 6 inch rectangle. Using a plant sprayer, generously mist the dough. Coat both sides of the dough completely with the seed mixture; make sure there are no bare spots. Gently brush the dough on both sides with olive oil and sprinkle it with kosher salt. Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper and oil the paper lightly. Stretch the rectangle so that it is a little longer. Using a dough cutter, cut the dough width-wise into twelve strips, almost 1 inch wide. Lift each stick, stretch it slightly so it's 8 inches long and lay it on the baking sheet. Place the sticks on the baking sheet with about 1 inch between them. Let rise for 30 minutes, until they become slightly puffy but not quite fully doubled. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone. Place the pan of bread on the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the oven door. After about 1 minute, mist the sticks with water 6 to 8 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Mist again after 1 more minute. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake 8 to 12 minutes longer, until the sticks look golden brown and are getting crisp on the outside. Brush the hot bread sticks with a little olive oil if desired, then transfer them to a rack to cool for a few minutes before serving.

      <li>Chicken wings</li>
      <li>Read below</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The key to good Buffalo Wings is how you prepare them as well as the ingredients and the handling of the wings. The most successful wings served up here in Buffalo are what they call "Grade A Grinders." Fresh wings that are very large and meaty. Usually, you cannot get them in a frozen package, but can get them from a poultry dealer. Once you find them make sure they are absolutely fresh. Wash them in cold water, split them at the joint and remove the tips. Place them on a rack on a pan and refrigerate overnight to let the blood and water drain out of the wings. THIS IS A REAL KEY. Drying the wings under refrigeration will help to make them a much crispier product, once deep fried. Next, use a deep fryer or a very heavy deep pot with a thermometer and add the oil. Peanut oil is very good, or a commercial product such as can be found at a restaurant cash and carry called Mel Fry. Heat the oil up SLOWLY, to 365F, and depending on the size of the fryer, deep fry the dry wings 6-8 minutes in small batches, until thoroughly done and golden brown. Hold the cooked wings in a warm oven if necessary. A combination of melted margarine and hot sauce in the ratio of 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce will add the right zing. The key here is to add just enough sauce to coat the wings - the more sauce you add, the hotter they will be. For the very brave, 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce and 1 part Tabasco is referred to as "Suicidal Wings" by the late and dear Don Bellissimo, who owned the Anchor Bar. Working quickly, place the deep fried wings in a large bowl and add the sauce mixture, shaking to coat them. There are many good hot sauces to use; the one they use is either Durkee Franks Red Hot Sauce or Wingers Original, again found in a restaurant cash and carry. Celery sticks and chunky blue cheese dressing (Ken's Buffalo Style Blue Cheese is a popular one) and plenty of napkins. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Add 2 T. butter, the molasses and salt; let stand until lukewarm. Add the yeast to the 1/2 cup lukewarm water, sprinkle with sugar, cover and let stand until foaming and doubled in volume. Add to corn meal mixture. Stir in the flour, gradually, just enough to make a stiff dough. Knead well for 10 minutes. Place in a warm greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in bulk. Cut through dough several times with a knife. Cover and let rise again for 45 minutes until doubled in bulk. Toss lightly on a floured board. Knead and mold into two loaves. Place in greased and lightly floured bread pans. Cover and let rise again until doubled in bulk. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes; reduce heat to 375 degrees and continue to bake until the loaves are golden brown. Brush bread with warm melted butter and turn on sides on a cooling rack to cool. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <title>Amy Scherber's Sponge Starter</title>
    <category>Bread</category>
    <category>Starter</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) very warm water</li>
      <li>(105 to 115 degrees)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups (16 ounces) unbleached</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 2 quart clear plastic</li>
      <li>Container</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, somewhat elastic batter has formed. The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options: If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse. This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of the sponge, the temperature of the room, and the strength of the yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It's best if you have already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much. If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but don't let it collapse to much before you use it.

    <title>Amy Scherber's Rosemary Fougasse</title>
    <category>Bread</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 Batch Amy's Crusty Italian</li>
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>A variation on the Crusty Italian Bread. Mix the dough according to the instructions given in the recipe. After the dough has taken its first rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (or overnight) it can be shaped into a fougasse. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a long narrow rectangle. Sprinkle a layer of chopped rosemary over the surface of the dough being careful to cover the edges too. Fold the dough in thirds like a business letter, the top third over the middle of the dough, then the bottom third over that, completely overlapping the two. Press the 3 open sides of the fougasse tightly shut. Cover the bread well with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone. Sprinkle a peel or upside-down baking sheet generously with cornmeal and place the fougasse on top, stretching it slightly to make it into a square. Cut a decorative pattern, such as a leaf or a ladder, into the dough with a dough cutter. Spread and stretch the loaf until the cuts form large openings. Be sure the fougasse is loosened from the peel, then carefully slide it onto the baking stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the bread with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later. Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaf sounds slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not brown enough, the bread will soften as it cools.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.

      <li>2 1/2 ounces Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Equipment: One 9-inch square baking pan, preferably non-stick, buttered on sides only; one sheet pan, lined with aluminum foil Place the yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the warm water and the yeast mixture and stir with your fingers to moisten the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5 minutes. This is a soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff and hard to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you get a nice malleable dough. Gently shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1to 2 more minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too firm. The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the top with oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9 tablespoons butter and the dark brown sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter has melted and the sugar is completely moistened (it won't be dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky and a little lighter in color. Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease the sides of a 9-inch square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting the pan slightly so the mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the warm caramel and press them down slightly. Put the pan in the refrigerator to cool the caramel; be the pan's on a level surface. Put the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until evenly mixed. Set aside. When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the floured work surface. Flatten the dough and stretch it with your fingers to form a 13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a long side facing you. Work gently so you don't tear the dough surface. The dough should stretch easily at this point, but if it resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and resume stretching. Check to be sure the dough isn't sticking to the work surface; flour the table again, if necessary. Spread 3 tablespoons of the softened butter evenly over the the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch strip unbuttered along the top edge. Sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture generously and evenly over the butter, again leaving the top 1/2-inch of the rectangle bare. Starting with the bottom edge, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If the dough sticks to the table as you're rolling, use a dough scraper to loosen it gently. Pinch gently but firmly along the seam to seal it. If necessary, gently shape the roll so it is a nice uniform log. Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator. Cut the log of dough into 9 equal pieces. (It's easiest to mark the roll first to show where you're going to make the cuts--a slight indentation with the knife edge will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut completely through the dough.) Lay the pieces cut side down on top of the caramel. Don't worry if it's a tight fit. Let rise, uncovered, at room temperature until the dough has almost doubled, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. The rolls should fill the pan and extend 1/2 to 3/4-inch above it. In the meantime, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the pan of sticky buns on a foil-lined baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of the buns are golden brown and crusty. It's important to bake the buns long enough so the dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel topping develops properly. Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then quickly but carefully turn the pan upside down and release the sticky buns onto a large flat heatproof plate. Immediately scrape out any hot caramel remaining in the bottom of the pan and spread it on the tops of the buns, filling in any bare spots. Let them cool until just warm before serving. (Clean the pan by soaking it in very hot water to dissolve the caramel.) Store any leftovers covered in plastic wrap at room temperature.

    <category>Low fat</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 packages Fast-rising dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Tepid water</li>
      <li>1 cup Whole-wheat flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Rye flour</li>
      <li>Unbleached white flour to make up 2 lbs. 3 oz. of total weight</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt mixed with:</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
      <li>Cornmeal for baking sheets</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put the tepid water in your electric mixer bowl and dissolve the yeast. Use a paper lunch sack for weighing out the flour. Put the whole-wheat and rye flour in the bag first, and then make up the weight with the white flour. Put 4 cups from the bag into the mixer and whip it for 10 minutes. Add the salted water. If you have a KitchenAid, allow the dough hook to do the rest of the work. Otherwise, add remaining flour by hand. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Put the dough on a plastic counter and cover with an inverted steel bowl. Allow it to rise once, punch it down, and allow it to rise a second time. Punch down and form into 2 or 3 loaaves. I never use bread pans for this, as they will ruin the crust. Place the loaves on baking sheets that have been dusted with cornmeal and allow the loaves to rise until double in bulk. Bake in a 450 degree oven about 25 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the loaf light to the touch. It should make a hollow sound when you thump your finger on the bottom of the loaf. Serving Ideas : Makes 2 or 3 loaves. NOTES : See Italian Breadsticks and Crustulum (Bruschetta) for other ways to use this bread recipe.

Finally, fold in the remaining dry mix. 5.Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, filling each cup only halfway. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. When cool enough to handle, transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack and cool completely. Make the chocolate frosting: 1.Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, set over medium heat, bring the cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Let the frosting cool and thicken slightly before icing the cupcakes. 2.Spread a thick layer of frosting onto each cupcake. Sprinkle the top of each cupcake with the toasted, chopped macadamia nuts. To serve, place a cupcake in the center of each dessert plate. Arrange 3 small scoops of the mango ice cream around each cupcake and garnish with mango slices.

      <li>From: hz225wu@unidui.uni-duisburg.de (Micaela Pantke) (COLLECTION) Date: Thu, 22 Jul 93 11:12:07 +0200 The following recipes are taken from an old Roman cookbook MARCUS GAVIUS APICIUS: DE RE COQUINARIA. The book I have is edited and translated from Latin by Robert Maier. My humble person only translated the German translations into English. I hope the recipes are still rather near to the originals. First I have to introduce you to some native Roman ingredients, such as: ~- Caroenum: Boiled must (you have to boil the new wine or grape juice until it is only half the amount you started with). ~- Defritum: Either thick fig syrup, or must that's boiled until you have only a third of the amount with which you started. ~- Liebstoeckl: I didn't find an English translation. In Latin it's called 'levisticum officinale'. It's an umbelliferous plant with yellowish flowers. Its dried roots are used as spice. It seems to be a kind of celery. ~- Liquamen: a salty fish sauce. Most of the time you can replace it by salt. ~- Passum: Very sweet wine sauce, made by boiling the must (new wine or grape juice) to thicken it. (maybe add honey? - just my guess) ~- Poleiminze: A kind of mint that's growing in inundated areas. Just replace it by ordinary mint. ~- Saturei: I didn't find an English translation. In Latin it's called 'satureia hortensis'. It's a violet or white flowered kind of labiate plants which grows mainly in Southern Europe. It's used as a spice plant, especially for bean dishes. ~- Silphium: Its other names are 'Laser' or 'ferula asa foetida'. I've noticed that it's also called 'hing' in the Indian cuisine. It is an onion and garlic substitute and should be used rather sparingly because of its very strong taste and smell.</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Mangoes</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pints Water</li>
      <li>2 ounces Almonds; toasted/blanched</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Citric acid</li>
      <li>6 drops Kewra essence OR 1 tb ruh kewra</li>
      <li>3 pounds Sugar</li>
      <li>8 Green cardamom; seeds only</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash, peel, cut the mangoes into large slices and prick all over with a fork. Or cut them into fancy shapes and do not prick. Tie the slices loosely in a piece of muslin, and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes in 1 1/4 pint of boiling water. Remove and dry them on a piece of cloth. Add sugar and citric acid to the water in which mango slices were boiled. Cook to one-thread consistency (remove the scum from the surface of the syrup). Add mango slices, simmer till the syrup thickens and the slices become tender and slightly translucent. Leave for 12 hours. Remove the slices from the syrup if they are sufficiently tender. Tie the crushed cardamom seeds in a piece of muslin and add this to the syrup. Boil till it again acquires one-thread consistency. Remove the muslin containing the cardamom seeds, squeeze out the juice and discard the seeds. Add mango slices and peeled halves of blanced almonds and cook for a few minutes more. Remove from the heat and cool. Add ruh kewra or essence and pour into hot clean glass jars, previously cleaned with boiling hot water. Fill just short of overflowing, put a disc of 2 to 3 layers of greaseproof or waxed paper over the mouth of the jar and cover with a screw-cap.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>DIFFICULTY: ** PREPARATION: 1 1/2 hours plus baking, cooling, chilling and freezing times. (Allow the ice cream to freeze overnight.) Recipe From: Chocolatier Magazine Special equipment: Two 6-cup jumbo muffin pans, cups 3 1/2 x 1 3/4 inches NOTE: Los Chileros de Nuevo Mexico brand, available at specialty food stores Make the mango ice cream base: 1.In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the sugar until blended. 2.In a heavy, large non-corrosive saucepan, bring the milk, cream and 1 tablespoon of the remaining sugar to a gentle boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Gradually whisk about 1 cup of the hot milk and cream mixture into the beaten egg yolks until blended. Return this mixture to the saucepan. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a flat-edged wooden spoon, for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the custard has thickened slightly. It is done when you can run your finger down the back of the custard-coated spoon and a path remains for several seconds. Do not let the custard come to a boil. 3.Remove the custard from the heat and strain through a sieve into a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl over a larger bowl of ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cool. Remove the bowl of custard from the bowl of ice water. Cover the surface of the custard with plastic and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight, until very cold. 4.Peel the mangoes and cut the flesh away from the seeds. Put the fruit and the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar into the bowl of a food processor, fitted with the metal chopping blade, and purée until smooth. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Freeze the mango ice cream: 1.Scrape the chilled ice cream base mixture into the container of an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions, adding the chilled mango purée for the final minute of churning. Transfer the ice cream to a storage bowl or container and smooth the top. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil. Freeze the ice cream overnight. Make the cupcakes: 1.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Brush the inside of two 6-cup jumbo muffin pans with butter. 2.Measure the first seven dry ingredients and sift together into a bowl. Sift again into another bowl, or onto a piece of parchment or wax paper. 3.In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the wire whip attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until it appears light and fluffy, about one minute. Add the eggs, one by one, stopping to scrape down the side of the bowl if necessary. Continue beating for 23 more minutes or until the mixture has tripled in volume. Transfer the mixture into a large bowl. 4.Fold one third of the flour mixture into the butter-egg mixture. Add half of the buttermilk and half of the coffee and combine well. Repeat, continued in part 2</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 large Dried Ancho chiles</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>gunterman@ccmailpc.ctron.com Recipe By: the California Culinary Academy Note: New Mexico, pasilla, or California chiles can be substituted for ancho chiles. 1. Put chiles in a bowl and cover with boiling water. When they are rehydrated, drain them and put them in a food processor or blender; process until finely chopped. 2. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter. With machine running, add hot butter to chiles in a fine stream. Blend until color is homogeneous and mixture is smooth. 3. Let stand at room temperature until butter reaches a spoonable consistency. Use immediately, or refrigerate or freeze for later use. Makes 1/2 cup. Microwave Version: Complete step 1. Put butter in a glass dish and microwave on 100% power until butter is melted, about 45 to 60 seconds. Continue with steps 2 and 3. Seasoned butters make an excellent topping for any roasted, broiled, or barbecued meat, poultry, or fish. The butters can be made up to four days ahead and refrigerated up to week; they can also be frozen two to three months. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

Add the butter and molasses and stir until evenly mixed. Cool to lukewarm. In a large mixing bowl dissolve the yeast in the half-cup warm water with the sugar or honey. When bubbly, add cornmeal mixture, salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. It should be thick but still beatable. Beat 5 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in the raisins. Gradually add 2/12 to 3 cups more flour, beating with a large spoon until the battter is too stiff to continue beating and holds together in a mass in the center of the bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it sit until the dough has risen to twice its original volume. Stir down with the spoon. If you wish, let it rise a second time. Stir down. Divide the dough between two buttered large loaf pans. Be sure you get equal amounts in each pan. Squish it into the corners with your fingers. Press to smooth the tops a bit; don't worry if they look like a lava flow. Cover the pans with a towel and let rise until batter reaches the tops of the pans. Preheat oven to 350F. Bake 40 - 45 minutes, until the loaves are brown but don't quite have a hollow sound when tapped on the bottoms. Remove them from the pans and put directly on the oven rack. Bake another 5 minutes to crisp the crust. Cool on a rack. The Garden Way Bread Book From the collection of Jim Vorheis From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Ancho Chile Butter</title>
    <category>Brenda</category>
    <category>Butters</category>
    <category>Cookbook</category>
    <category>Mexican</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 teaspoons Pure olive oil</li>
      <li>2 Dried ancho chiles</li>
      <li>5 Cloves garlic; skins on</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Coriander seeds; ground</li>
      <li>1/3 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/3 teaspoons Chili powder</li>
      <li>1/2 Lemon, Zest of</li>
      <li>1 pound Salted butter; at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Parsely; finely chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Fill a small bowl with very hot tap water. Place olive oil in small saute' pan and set over medium-high heat. When oil barely begins to smoke, add chiles and roast, turning until skins are soft and slightly puffed. Remove chiles to the hot water and let soak for 30 minutes. In the same skillet and again over high heat, roast garlic cloves, shaking the pan until skins are golden brown and shriveling. Remove from heat. When cloves are cool to the touch, squeeze garlic out of the skins and reserve. When chiles have finished soaking, drain, seed, and stem them. Place them and the garlic in the bowl of a food processor equipped with a steel blade. Add coriander, salt, chili powder, lemon zest, and one-fourth of the butter. Process until all ingredients are well-pureed. Gradually add the rest of the butter and process until it is incorporated. Add parsley and process a second more just to fold in. Remove to a storage container and refrigerate to store. To use, melt the butter over low heat. MAKES 2 1/2 CUPS NOTES: The great thing about composed butters is that they keep so well and have so many uses. Let this butter, for example, hang around your refrigerator for a couple of months. Toss pasta with it. Make your next omelet with it. Saute' boneless chicken in it. Dollop some on a piece of grilled fish. Cook shrimp in it. Spread it on slices of an old baguette, run them under the broiler, and serve as an appetizer that will bring guests back for more. See what we mean? And do not forget to melt some of the butter over a baked potato. This particular butter uses the mild dried ancho chile pepper to give it a South-west flavor and a rich, rusty color. Allow 2 tablespoons of butter for every 1/4 pound of pasta - a little more if you are adding other ingredients, such as vegetables or chicken, to the pasta. PREPARE-AHEAD/SERVING NOTES: The butter will keep refrigerated for at least three months. ESSENTIAL GEAR: Electric food processor HERE IS A GOOD USE FOR ANCHO CHILI BUTTER: Blanch asparagus spears (we especially like California purple asparagus for its plump, tender stalks that require no peeling). Allow 4 to 6 meaty spears per serving. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside. In a large saute' pan, melt Ancho Chile Butter, allow 3 to 4 tablespoons per serving. Add asparagus spears and quickly warm in the hot butter. With tongs, remove asparagus to hot plates. Leave any extra butter in the saute' pan. While asparagus warms, cook fresh egg fettuccine until tender. Drain and immediately toss with the remaining butter in saute' pan. Serve the pasta over the asparagus spears and top with a light grating of Parmigiano Reggiano . Marcella Rosene, Pasta &amp; Co.

      <li>Jim Maslanka &lt;jmasl@fnbc.com&gt; Ancho Rubbed Chicken (Fried Chicken Breasts Rubbed in Ancho Peppers) The Rub: Toast dried peppers on a hot iron skillet; remove stem; slit and remove seeds Place peppers in a pan; cover with water; bring to a boil; remove from heat; let stand for 1 hour. Place all rub ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth; run mixture through a food mill (fine filter) if possible. Should be a thick paste. Seasoned coating: Mix ingredients thoroughly. Chicken: 2 whole chicken breasts, boned, skinned, and split; rinse and pat dry Separate the tenderloins from each breast; you'll now have 8 pieces of chicken Pound chicken flat to about 50% increase in size Score meat with sharp knife in a 1/2 inch criss cross pattern. Preparation: Lightly dust chicken meat on all sides with flour, allow to dry for 5 minutes. With a butter knife, spread the ancho paste evenly on one side of the chicken pieces; rub into the scored pattern (should be enough paste to "hide" the chicken meat). Sprinkle liberally with seasoned coating; pat it into the paste; allow to dry for 5 min. Turn chicken pieces over and repeat the paste and coating process on other side of meat. Pour 1 cup of olive oil into a hot iron skillet; add 1/4 stick of butter; reduce heat to medium. Don't crowd the chicken in the pan (cook breasts first, followed by tenderloins); for each batch: cook, covered, for 5 minutes; turn the meat; cook for another 5 minutes. Remove meat, place on a warming rack in a 300 degree oven. Continue cooking remaining meat. Notes: 1. I served this with a yellow corn and black bean salsa, cooked for about 5 minutes with onions, 1 tsp balsamic vinegar, and 1/4 cup chicken broth. 2. I got the idea for this from "Great Chefs of the East", and changed it slightly for the ingredients at hand: 3. Leftover chicken makes great sandwiches, too.

Add ingredients to bread machine in order except cheese which is added during final kneading. Bake at regular setting for 1-1/2 Lb loaf. Serving Ideas : Great with soups or stews NOTES : This is a bread machine recipe. I have used Calvins Powder for this recipe. If you do not have it, feel free to substitute another powdered hot pepper. I have only used 1 teaspoon as it adds heat without being overwhelming. You can add more to suit your tastes, but watch how much more you add as it will affect the consistency of the dough. You can also substitute sharp cheddar cheese for the provolone. The ground anchos add wonderful flavor and a nice orange color to the bread.

Subia) Ancho Chile Devil's Food Cake with Godiva Liqueur and Marshmallow Frosting, The James Beard Foundation/Godiva Liqueur Baking Competition, New York Regional Competition Winner/Dessert Category, Wayne Harley Brachman, Pastry Chef, Mesa Grill and Bolo, New York City. 1. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Lightly grease the sides of two 15-1/2 by 10-1/2 inch jelly-roll pans. Line them with parchment or buttered waxed paper, melted butter or non-stick vegetable spray for greasing the pan. 2. Sift the flour, cocoa, ancho, cayenne, baking powder, baking soda and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper. Sift two more times to mix and aerate. Put the butter and sugar in the bowl or an electric mixer and beat at high speed for two minutes until well combined and smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until each is incorporated. Continue beating until light and very fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary, about five more minutes. With the mixer on its lowest setting, or by hand with a rubber spatula, fold in one half of the dry mixture. Fold in the vanilla and one quarter of the buttermilk and coffee; another one third of the dry mixture and then the remaining buttermilk and coffee. Finally, fold in the remaining ingredients. 3. Spread the batter evenly in the two pans. Bake for 30 minutes or until the center springs back when lightly pressed. Cool the cake layers, in the pans, on a wire rack. 4. When cool, turn them out of the pans by inverting each one onto a plate. Split each cake into two layers and fill with the Marshmallow Frosting to create a four layer cake. Frost the outside with Ganache. You may pipe on extra Marshmallow Frosting to decorate. Godiva Liqueur Marshmallow Frosting: 1. Put the water, sugar and corn syrup in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over high heat to soft ball (240 degrees). If necessary, stir a few times to help dissolve the sugar crystals. 2. Meanwhile, in an immaculately clean and dry mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt. When soft peaks form, sprinkle on the teaspoon of sugar and whisk until the peaks stiffen to the consistency of shaving cream. Set aside until the syrup is ready. 3. While constantly whisking the egg whites, carefully drizzle in the hot syrup. Mix in the Godiva Liqueur and continue to whisk until cooled down, thickened and spreadable. 4. In the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk together the butter and confectioner's sugar. Fold in the egg white mixture. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>Recipe By: Annie Somerville in "Fields of Greens" Preheat the oven to 350 F. Roast the chiles on an ungreased baking sheet until they puff up and smell toasty, about 5 minutes. Pull the chiles apart at the stem end and remove the stem (and the seeds, if you so desire). Place the chiles in a small bowl and cover with hot water, allowing them to soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Place the chiles in a blender or food processor; add a small amount of the soaking liquid and process to a smooth puree, adding more liquid if needed. The puree will keep in the refrigerator for as long as several weeks. Serving Ideas : Add to sauces for heat and a dark, almost musty flavor.

    <title>Ancho Chili Scented Crown Roast of Pork</title>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE PORK</li>
      <li>1 6 to 7 pound center-cut loin of pork tied into a crown roast, bones facing outward</li>
      <li>1 ounce Dried Ancho chili peppers, soaked in</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Hot water until softened, seeds carefully removed, pureed until smooth</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Tomato puree or ketchup</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Honey</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Coarsely ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground cumin seed</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves, finely chopped, about 1 tab</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Good Kentucky Bourbon</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1 Carrot; roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 Onion; roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 Celery stalk; roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry white wine</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Rendered pork fat</li>
      <li>2 cups Hot chicken broth</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Have your butcher tie the pork roast into the traditional crown roast shape, chine bone removed, split between the ribs to facilitate the formation of the crown shape. Ask for the chine bone which will be used to roast the meat on to avoid burning the bottom. In a saucepan over medium heat combine the pureed Ancho chili, tomato puree, honey, vinegar, Worcestershire, black pepper, ground cumin and garlic. Bring the ingredients to a simmer and allow to cook for 20 minutes before rem oving from the heat and adding the bourbon. Season the roast with salt and pepper and brush with Ancho marinade. Place the chine bone in a roasting pan and place the pork roast on the bones: this will prevent the bottom of the roast from burning. Place the roasting pan into the oven and cook for 20 minutes before turning the heat down to 350 degrees F. Brush the roast at frequent interva ls during the cooking process to keep the roast moist as well as perfumed with the spice mixture. Add the roughly cut vegetables and continue to cook until the roast reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Remove the roast from the pan and allow to stand for 20 minutes before carving. While the roast is resting make the quick pan gravy by pouring off all of the rendered pork fat, leaving the rough cut vegetables in the pan. Place the roasting pan on the stove top, turn the burner on underneath the roasting pan and continue to cook the vegetables with the chine bone. Carefully deglaze the pan by adding the wine allowing most o f the liquid to cook off before adding the hot chicken broth, reducing the heat to a simmer. Meanwhile in a small saucepan combine the 3 tablespoons of pork fat with the flour and cook gently to make a light brown r oux, cooking about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a wire whisk, add the roux to the simmering stock and whip the ingredients together to avoid lumping. Add any remaining marinade to the gravy, then cook for 5 minutes before strai ning through a fine mesh strainer. Serve the roast, by carving at the table, with the dressing and gravy on the side.

A chef on TV (could have been on Bert Wolfe's show) prepared this: Ancho puree: Remove stem, seeds and veins from 4-5 ancho chiles. Cut in pieces. Soak in boiling water 20 minutes. Blend in blender with small amount of fresh water. Cream eggs and sugars. Add flour and ancho paste. Add melted margarine. Mix well. Add nuts, chocolate chips and vanilla. Put in shell. Bake at 350 d. about 1 hr. until lightly browned. Serve with Cool Whip. CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #243 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground red pepper; (optional) Tom's Own Quick (fat-free)BBQ Sauce---</li>
      <li>2 cups Barbecue sauce; low-sodium, hickory-smoked &amp; fat free</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Low-sodium worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Louisiana hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Paprika</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Blackstrap molasses</li>
      <li>1 Chipotle chili pepper; dried or canned (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Sauce: Combine all Blast of Taste-Baste ingredients in a large (8 qt) soup pot. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Yields 1 gallon Note: After your beef brisket takes a nice long simmer in this spicy broth, use it to mop, or baste, your brisket every 10 minutes while it grills. Note: "Liquid smoke" introduces that flavor we all love but with none of the potentially carcinogenic compounds in real smoke. Rub: Combine all rub ingredients in a small bowl. Yields 2/3 c (enough to rub both sides of one whole brisket or two 2 1/2- to 3-lb brisket pieces). BBQ Sauce: Combine all BBQ sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Stir to blend thoroughly. Cook, uncovered, over low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard chipotle pepper (if used). Spoon sauce over beef brisket slices. Yields 1 cup. Meat: Step 1 In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, bring "mop" "Blast-of-Taste Baste" to a boil. Submerge a 3-lb trimmed beef brisket (choose a square-end piece over a pointed end; it has less fat content) in the spicy broth. Reduce heat to low and simmer 3 hours. Add water as needed, just to cover meat. Step 2 Remove brisket from mop to large platter. Let brisket cool 5 minutes. Using your fingertips, press 1/3 c dry rub into both sides of the warm brisket, covering all surfaces. NOTE: Store any remaining rub in an airtight jar and refrigerate or freeze. Step 3 Preheat a covered gas barbecue grill on high for 1 minute, lighting both sides. Turn off burner on right side of grill. Carefully lift right cooking grid, using pliers or fireproof glove. Place a disposable baking pan (8 1/2 x 12-in.) under right grid and lower grid back into place. Place rubbed brisket onto right grid, directly over pan. With a spoon, lightly baste meat with simmered mop. Close grill lid. Reduce heat on left side of grill to medium. Roast brisket for 30 minutes, basting with mop every 10 minutes. Turn brisket over and roast for 30 minutes more, again basting every 10 minutes. Step 4 Remove brisket to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes, to redistribute juices. Using a long, sharp knife, slice brisket thinly across the grain (approximately 1/8-in. slices). Serve 3 oz of sliced meat on a multigrain roll and slather with "Tom's Own Quick Barbecue Sauce".

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Stephen Ceideburg</li>
      <li>1 pound Boneless beef round (1 inch thick)</li>
      <li>2 Stalks fresh lemongrass *</li>
      <li>2 Shallots</li>
      <li>3 Cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>1 Fresh serrano chili</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sesame seeds</li>
      <li>2 ounces Dried rice stick noodles</li>
      <li>Boiling water</li>
      <li>12 large Red lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 small English cucumber, peeled and julienned</li>
      <li>24 Fresh mint leaves</li>
      <li>36 Fresh coriander leaves, each with a little stem</li>
      <li>Nuoc cham dipping sauce (see below)</li>
      <li>12 (12-inch) dried rice-paper circles</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* or 2 tablespoons dried lemongrass soaked in warm water for 1 hour This "fresh" Vietnamese spring roll is not fried, which makes it lighter and very refreshing. The filling, though herbaceous and hearty, is also light. Note that the beef needs to be marinated for at least 3 hours before cooking. 1. Cut the beef into 4- by 3/4-inch pieces. Slice each piece across the grain into 1/4-inch thick strips. 2. Remove and discard the tough outer leaves of the lemongrass. Slice the tender white heart into 1-inch lengths and put them in a food processor with the shallots, garlic, chili and sugar; process into a paste. Transfer the paste to a bowl and mix in the fish sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds. Add the beef slices, mix, and marinate for at least 3 hours or overnight. 3. In a medium bowl, cover the rice stick noodles with boiling water; let stand 1 minute, then drain. Arrange the rice stick noodles, lettuce, cucumber strips, mint and coriander in separate piles on a platter, leaving space for the beef. Refrigerate. 4. Just before serving, preheat a grilling rack over hot coals. Grill the beef strips for 30 seconds on each side, just until nicely seared. Or place the beef strips on the highest oven rack under a hot broiler and broil on each side until seared. Arrange the beef on the platter. 5. Have a dish of dipping sauce and one or more wide bowls of warm water on the tables. Each guest dips a rice paper circle into a water bowl and immediately spreads it flat on a dinner plate or a damp towel. The circle will rehydrate and become pliable in a few seconds. It is then ready to be filled and rolled. 6. To make a spring roll, lay a lettuce leaf on the bottom third of the moistened circle. Top it with 2 or 3 slices of beef, a large tablespoon of noodles, several strips of cucumber and a few leaves of mint and coriander. Fold the near edge of the paper over the filling, then roll up the paper around the filling, keeping it taut. Halfway through, fold one end over to enclose the filling; then continue rolling. Dip the open end of the roll into the sauce and eat it with the fingers. Serves 6. Note: To make Vietnamese nuoc cham dipping sauce: Grind 4 garlic cloves, 2 fresh chilis (preferably serrano) and 2 tablespoons sugar into a paste in a mortar, blender or mini food processor. Stir in 6 tablespoons Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam), 4 tablespoons fresh lime juice and 6 to 8 tablespoons water. Strain into a dipping bowl. IMAGE, Jim Wood, Sunday, March 8, 1992.

      <li>1. Slice the steak very thin on the bias. Score each piece with an X. 2. Chop the scallions and crush the garlic. Combine these ingredients with the remaining seasonings in a bowl. Add the meat to the marinade and mix well until all sides of the steak are coated. 3. The meat may be grilled immediately. The best results are obtained if the steak is marinated for 2 hours. The marinade will keep overnight Variation: Use rib steak or flank steak. Bul Kogi is so popular that many Koreans consider it the national meat dish. Serve with rice and kimchi.

(I often have the butcher skin the chicken.) Cut 2-3 slits, 1 inch long and 1/2 inch deep, in each piece of chicken. Place in a casserole dish and set aside. Cut onion into 4-5 pieces. In a blender jar put onion, tomato sauce, yogurt, ginger, garlic cloves, coriander, cayenne pepper, cloves, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, salt, garam masala and red food coloring. Blend to a smooth paste. Pour the tandoori paste on the chicken and turn pieces to thoroughly coat with spices. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator 4-24 hours. Preheat oven to 400øF. Remove chicken pieces from the marinade, saving marinade. Arrange pieces in a broiler pan. Bake uncovered in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes. Turn pieces over and brush with remaining marinade. Bake for 10-15 minutes until chicken is tender. Turn oven to broil. Turn pieces over once again and broil for 5 minutes to get a nice red color. Transfer to a serving platter. Serve with lemon wedges or squeeze lemon juice over the chicken before eating, if desired.

      <li>probably need about 1 to 2 cups for a good sized chicken. I get a whole chicken and cut it into pieces but there is no reason this wouldn't work on just the chicken breasts. Use about 2 parts butter or margarine to one part lemon juice. Melt the butter and mix with the lemon juice. Stir in garlic salt to tast. My husband says "lots" of garlic salt. If you are opposed to the fat in the margarine, just use the garlic salt and lemon juice for a tangy, garlicy grilled chicken.

(I used my fiberware electric grill) To prepare sauce, in small sucepan, combine ketchup, vinegar, horseradish, brown sugar, garlic, and thyme. Mix well. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in pepper. Brush tops of chicken pieces lightly with sauce. Place chicken, sauce-side down, on a foil-lined broiler pan or grill rack. Brush other sides lightly with sauce. Broil or grill 3 inches from heat, basting with reminaing sauce and turning until no longer pink in center, about 5 to 7 minutes per side (mine took a lot longer, because of the pieces were fatter and farther away from the heat). Let chicken stand for 5 minutes before serving. I served this with rice (actually I must admit I used Rice Roni... my kids love it), tossed green salad, and mixed vegetables.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Stephen Ceideburg</li>
      <li>3 pounds Chicken, cut into 8 pieces, skin and fat removed, or:</li>
      <li>8 Skinless chicken breasts or thighs</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Tomato ketchup</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Unsulfured molasses</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Chinese chili paste with garlic</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Precooking the chicken in the microwave or gently poaching it on the stovetop before finishing it on the grill ensures that the meat is cooked through but the sauce is not charred If you like a hotter sauce, increase the amount of chili paste. Arrange chicken pieces in a micro-proof dish, with the thickest parts toward the outside of the dish. Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave at HIGH (100%) 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender, turning pieces twice. Alternatively, in a wide sauce-pan, cover chicken with cold water and bring to a simmer, skimming off any froth. Simmer gently until chicken is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the grill or preheat the broiler. In a small bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients. With tongs, remove the chicken from the dish or sauce pan and brush both sides generously with barbecue sauce. Grill over medium-high heat or broil, basting with the barbecue sauce often, until the chicken is glazed on the outside and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes on each side.

    <recipetext>
      <li>* - boned and trimmed of surface fat ** - or regular pocket bread, cut in half crosswise 1. Lay meat boned side up. Slash about halfway through thickest portions, as needed, and pull meat, patting cut edges down, to make the piece relatively even. 2. Place lamb in a 9x13" pan. In a 1 1/2 quart pan over medium-high heat, stir vinegar with 1/3 cup mint jelly just until boiling. Stir in mint and pour evenly over lamb. Cover and chill 2 hours or up to a day. Turn meat over occasionally. 3. On firegrate in a barbecue, with a lid, ignite 50-60 charcoal briquets. When briquets are dotted with ash, in about 30 minutes, spread them into a single layer; scatter 10-12 more briquets over coals. Set grill 5-6" above coals. Lift meat onto grill; reserve marinade. Put lid on barbecue and open vents. 4.Turn meat as needed to brown evenly; baste with marinade. Cook until thickest part of meat is done to your liking; for rare (140' on a thermometer) in center of thickest part, allow about 40 minutes total. Thinner sections will be well done. 5. Transfer lamb to a platter and let rest 5-10 minutes. Garnish with mint sprigs. Slice meat thin. Season to taste with mint jelly, salt, and pepper. Eat with knife and fork or tuck into pocket bread.

    <category>Potatoes</category>
    <category>Poultry</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Boneless chicken breasts; skin left on</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>675 grams New potatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Tarragon vinegar</li>
      <li>4 Shallots; finely chopped</li>
      <li>6 Rashers smoked streaky bacon, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Chopped fresh tarragon</li>
      <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Mixed salad leaves; to serve</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Heat a barbecue, grill or griddle. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then rub in one tablespoon of olive oil. Barbecue, grill or griddle the chicken, skin-side down, for 8-10 minutes, then turn and cook for another 8-10 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, boil the potatoes for about 20 minutes. Drain, then peel and halve or quarter, depending on size. Mix the remaining oil with the vinegar and shallots, season, then pour over the potatoes. Fry the bacon until crispy, then stir it into the potato salad with the tarragon. 3. To serve, arrange mixed salad leaves on four plates, spoon over the warm potato and bacon salad, and top with the chicken breasts. NOTES : Barbecuing is such a great way to cook chicken because the slight burnt tinge works so well with the natural sweetness of the meat. These chicken breasts have just been seasoned, rubbed with oil and then barbecued. Chicken with bacon or tarragon - or both - is a classic combination, and the warm potatoes in olive oil dressing bring all the tastes together, so this dish is a real treat. If you don’t have a barbecue, simply grill or griddle the chicken instead. Push a knob of butter under the skin of the chicken before cooking to give it a tastier, more succulent finish; and why not squeeze some lemon juice after cooking to lift the flavours. For a creamier potato and bacon salad, stir in two to three tablespoons of mayonnaise.

      <li>Ingredient Group: NORMA WRENN</li>
      <li>4 Skinless; boneless chicken</li>
      <li>Breast halves (4 oz each)</li>
      <li>For the sauce:</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Reduced-sodium ketchup</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ready-made white horseradish</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dark brown sugar; firm pack</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic; minced</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Dried thyme</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time 15 to 20 minutes Preheat broiler, heat a charcoal grill until coals form white ash, or preheat a gas grill to medium. To prepare sauce, in a small saucepan, combine ketchup, vinegar, horseradish, brown sugar, garlic, and thyme. Mix well. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in pepper. Brush tops of chicken pieces lightly with sauce. Place chicken, sauce-side down, on a foil-lined broiler pan or grill rack. Brush other sides lightly with sauce. Broil or grill 3 inches from heat, basting with remaining sauce and turning until no longer pink in center, about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Let chicken stand for 5 minutes before serving. Short Cut: When time is short, omit the sauce. Instead, use 1/2 cup of ready-made reduced-sodium barbecue sauce mixed with a little cider vinegar, or red-wine vinegar, or white horseradish. Proceed as directed. Per serving: Calories 146 (9% from fat) Carbohydrates 5g Protein 26g Sodium 188mg Fat 1 g Cholesterol 66mg Cook's Tips: To prevent foods from sticking to the grill, scrub the grill rack and spray it with vegetable cooking spray. A special wire brush works well for scrubbing; it can be found at supermarkets or hardware shops. Chicken must be seared over a hot grill before turning or the skin will stick to the grill. Turn seeral times throughout cooking and baste with each turn. While cooking on a grill, use long-handled tongs to turn the chicken pieces. A fork would pierce the meat and allow the flavorful juices to escape.

      <li>or tortas (Mexican sandwiches). The flavors improve and intensify with time, making this the perfect make-ahead dish. INSTRUCTIONS: Blend together lime juice, olive oil and garlic salt. Rub on chicken pieces. Grill over medium-hot coals or under a medium broiler. Cook breasts for about 10 minutes per side; thighs for about 15 minutes per side. Tip: If you are in a hurry, you can cheat by buying a grilled chicken -- preferably from a Mexican deli. The chicken will finish cooking in the sauce where it will absorb all the delicious flavors. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onions; saute until softened. Add garlic; saute for a minute or two longer. Remove onions from pan and reserve. Add chorizo to pan; saute until browned. Using paper towels, blot as much fat as possible from pan. Return onions to pan. Add tomatoes, then stir in tomato puree, chipotle, bay leaf, oregano, brown sugar and salt. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Cut grilled chicken meat off bones; add to simmering sauce along with diced potatoes. Simmer for 15 minutes, until potatoes are tender and flavors come together. Serve garnished with avocado slices and lots of warm corn tortillas. Note: To make chipotle puree from the softer, freshly smoked chipotles, cut chiles open and scrape out seeds. Place 6 chipotles in a blender with about 1/4 cup water, or just enough to facilitate blending; process until smooth. Serves 4.

      <li>Make a mixture of the margarine, parsley, tarragon and marjoram. Using a dull knife, lift the skin from the breast meat of the halved chickens and insert the blend of margarine and seasonings. Spread the blend under the skin as widely as possible, making sure the skin is not so detached it will come off when the chicken is turned on the grill. Make a marinade of the oil, wine, soy sauce, crushed garlic clove and salt. Let chicken stand in marinade overnight, or at least several hours. Turn chicken once during this period. Grill chicken halves over glowing coals on a greased rack. Turn halves occasionally while basting with marinade until golden brown, which should take about 1/2 hour. Yield: 6 servings. WANDA C.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Soak beans overnight in cold water to cover. Fry bacon until crisp. Drain drippings from bacon into baking dish or small bean pot. Add all remaining ingredients to fat and blend. Drain beans and add to mixture. Blend. Crumble the crisp bacon over top. Add water just to cover beans. Cover dish or bean pot and bake at 325 degrees F. for 2 hours. Add more hot water if needed. Uncover beans during last 20 to 30 minutes. Serve from baking dish. A slice of smoky bacon rind used instead of the sliced bacon will give a more decidedly country flavor. Brown sugar to taste may replace the corn syrup. And canned tomatoes may take the place of the catsup -- but if so, correct the seasoning as necessary with a little sugar, salt, cayenne and a pinch of ground allspice.

    <ingredient>
      <li>9 pounds Goose; Rinsed, Patted Dry</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>8 ounces Herb-Seasoned Stuffing Cubes</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Brandy</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Butter (1 Stick)</li>

      <li>3/4 cups Pitted Prunes; Quartered</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil; For Rubbing</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the goose on a flat work surface and remove all loose fat. Sprinkle the cavity with 1 teaspoon salt; set aside. Prepare the herbed bread stuffing according to package directions, using 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup brandy and butter. Once the stuffing is thoroughly moistened, stir in the tangerines, celery, prunes and raisins; stir well to distribute the fruit evenly. spoon the mixture into the body cavity, using up any remaining to fill in the neck cavity. Close both ends of the goose with skewers and place in a pan. Pierce the skin of the goose all over with the tines of a fork. Rub the skin all over lightly with vegetable oil before, not during, barbecuing. Rub the remaining salt on the skin. Set a drip pan in the center of the coals. Place the goose on a rack directly over the pan. Using a medium-slow wood or charcoal fire, cooking time will be between 2 3/4 to 3 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the goose, and the heat of the fire. The goose is done when the joints move freely. Remove the goose from the grill and set on a platter to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Hello, Barbecue Enthusiasts! Barbecued ribs and chicken demand the perfect side service of bubbling baked beans. Today's recipe is a bit of a misnomer, as it is actually prepared in your oven a day or two in advance of your cookout, and the grill is utilized only to reheat the beans and add a little of that smoky essence to your outdoor culinary efforts. Now, you don't have to tell your guests that you're serving two-day-old beans -- let them think you've been working at the grill since the wee hours of the morning just to prepare the perfect barbecue side dish of grilled beans for them tonight. Remember, cooking secrets should be kept secret! Making it look easy is part of the fun. Rinse and sort the beans, making sure to discard any that are shriveled or discolored. Put beans in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring them to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer, adding more water if necessary (up to 2 cups) to keep beans covered. Simmer beans until tender, approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Drain beans and reserve the water in the saucepan. Preheat oven to 275-F degrees. In a bean pot or Dutch Oven, layer cooked beans, brown sugar, onions, sorghum or molasses, and meat scraps, making sure to finish the top layer with beans. Stir in soy and Worcestershire sauces, dry mustard, salt to taste, and Liquid Smoke, if desired. Add reserved bean water and up to one additional cup of fresh water to cover the beans. Bake, uncovered, for 5 to 6 hours, making sure to stir occasionally. If beans get too brown, cover loosely with a sheet of aluminum foil. If beans dry out, add a little more water and stir from the bottom of the ovenproof dish. When they are thoroughly cooked, remove them from the oven and let stand to cool. Refrigerate to store. About 30 to 45 minutes prior to finishing the main course of your barbecue, you're going to finish the beans on your prepared moderate- heat grill. Now, it's best if you have transferred the beans from your good bean pot or Dutch Oven to a heavy-bottomed saucepan that you never intend to use again for anything but grilled beans (or perhaps an outdoor planter). If you don't want to waste a dish just for grilled beans, take a large can (for example, an empty tin that held stewed tomatoes) that you have painstakingly washed, dried, and saved just for your grilled beans. Spray the can with a non-stick cooking spray and place the beans in the can, then heat the beans on the grill in it. You'll want to stir from the bottom of the can with a wooden spoon to make sure the beans aren't sticking and to evenly distribute the heat from the grill. Serve the beans warm with your main course. Kitchen Staff Tip: If you're like most cooks and you don't happen to have burnt ends from your last pork barbecue in the refrigerator or freezer, simply purchase a 1/4-lb portion of smoked ham or a ham slice. Tear or cut up the ham and cook it in a skillet over moderate heat with a dab of butter or margarine, a tablespoon of brown sugar, and your favorite barbecue sauce. Cook it until it's browned and gooey, then cool before using in today's recipe. Or, to give it an even more authentic barbecued flavor, cook the ham on the grill with your favorite barbecue sauce, then cut or tear it into small bite-size portions before proceeding with today's recipe as above.

    <recipetext>
      <li>from Sizzling Southwestern Cookery by Lisa Golden Schroeder These enchiladas ave very different from most classic renditions - and I think they're even better! 1. In small shallow baking dish, mix first seven ingredients. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours, stirring occasionally. 2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Saute chicken-marinade mixture until chicken is no longer pink, about 4 minutes. 3. Wrap tortillas in damp dish towel. In bottom of 13x9x2-inch baking dish, spread 3/4 cup of enchilada sauce. 4. Working with one trotilla at a time (keep others covered), spoon about 2 tablespoons chicken mixture down center or each tortilla and sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons cheese. Roll tortillas up tightly and place seam-side down in baking dish. 5. Pour remaining sauce over rolled tortillas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Gake uncovered until heated through and bubbly, about 30 minutes. 6. Serve with sour cream, salsa, and beans. Makes 6 servings.

      <li>1 cup Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 Tamari sauce</li>

      <li>Fresh ground pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place chicken wings, disjointed, in large flat pan. Combine other ingredients and pour over chicken. Let stand for at least 1 hour or over night. Be sure all wings are well coated with marinade. Place pan in 350 oven and reduce heat to 250. Bake 4-5 hours, turning wings at regular intervals. If all marinade is not absorbed, pour off and dry wings out a bit longer in oven (but not too much) before serving. Makes a great hors d'oeuvre or main course despite being a bit messy to eat.

      <li>Hello, Grilling Enthusiasts! Nearly every occupant of any home or apartment in the world has access to a charcoal grill, hibachi, gas grill, cast iron grilling skillet, or fire pit. There is no social class structure, gender, or ethnic group that has not prepared food over an open flame. The Cook and Kitchen Staff are not saying that all the world's issues could be resolved over a barbecue, but it is nice to recognize one thing that we all have in common on a global basis. Today's recipe is a classic for grilled chicken that takes very little time to put together and makes a lovely main course as prepared over any type of open flame. As with all grill-prepared meals, cooking time will vary, so please use your good judgment. Combine garlic, salt, peppercorns, and coriander in a flat dish with the cilantro (or parsley) and lime juice. Rub the paste-like mixture well into the chicken breasts on all sides, cover, and refrigerate overnight or at least one hour. Cook chicken over glowing coals, turning about every five minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and the skin is crisp. Garnish with tomatoes and curls of scallions. Serve with a simple salad of cucumber, tomato, and scallions, seasoned with lime juice, oil, and salt.

    <title>Baker's Craft Dough</title>
    <category>Crafts</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 cups Unsifted flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Powdered Alum</li>
      <li>(preservative)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cooking oil (easier to</li>
      <li>Work)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Food color</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Clove or peppermint oil</li>
      <li>Acrylic paints</li>
      <li>Spray acrylic fixative</li>
      <li>Clear shellac</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix together flour, salt, and alum. With a big wooden spoon, slowly stir in the water, oil, coloring, and scent. Keep mixing until the dough follows the spoon around the bowl and then knead with your hands until smooth. The initial kneading will only take a minute or two to get the dough going and to make it pliable. After that you will knead as you work into smaller pieces and the dough will stay soft. Store dough in the refrigerator until ready to use. It will remain in good condition for up to 4 weeks. Let it warm to room temperature before using. To Use: Generously flour the work surface and pinch off just enough dough to mold with. Leave the rest in a plastic bag until needed. Fill a small bowl with water to use as glue when you want to stick pieces together. When you have made an item you want to keep, place it on a floured cookie sheet and bake in the oven at 250 degrees fo at least an hour. Baking time varies considerably depending on the thickness of the object. It's a good idea to check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the thickest part of the item. If you think your ornaments aore getting too brown, cover them with aluminum foil, turn down the oven, and compensate by cooking a bit longer. After the item is completely dry, you can paint ti with acrylic paints and then either paint it with shellac or spray it with several coats of acrylic fixative. Ideas: This dough is used quite successfully for creating homey-looking Christmas ornaments. When my kids were little, I helped them make their own creations each year for the tree and now I treasure these ornaments. Try helping children create their own handprints by outstretching their hands shile you carefully cut around their fingers with a dull paring knife. Or they can press their handprints into a plaque-size circle of dough. All sorts of kitchen implements can be used to gi e interesting textures to the dough. By far the most interesting effects can be created by forcing the dough through a garlic press. The resulting threads can be used for a bird's nest, hair, animal fur, and of course, spaghetti. Just remember to "glue" the strands together with water as you go. Add teeny little eggs to a nest or roll out some meatballs for a bowl of spaghetti. Another natural creation for Baker's Craft dough is to make a bread basket, bagel, or pretend muffins out of it. To make a basket, roll out and cut thick strips of dough. Drape several, close together, across and inverted, heavily floured loaf pan or baking dish. Weave strips in the opposes direction through the original ones. Create a lattice work design and finish off the edges as if you were creating a fancy pie. Bake your creation, pan and all, in the oven and lift the basket off the pan when it is completely cool. Hints: A rolling pin is extremely useful for flattening the dough, but if you have many little hands around the table at once, cans of soup or veggies will work just as well. You can finish the smaller items by coating them with clear nail polish. Or try brushing them with evaporated milk if you want your creations to look brown and golden, like baked goods.

      <li>3/4 teaspoons Salt</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 450 F. Cut shortening into flour, baking powder and salt with pastry blender until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in just enough milk so dough leaves side of bowl and rounds up into a hail. (Too much milk makes dough sticky; not enough milk makes biscuits dry.) Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 10 times. Roll or pat to 1/2 inch thick. Cut with floured 2-inch biscuit cutter. Place on ungreased cookie sheet about 1 inch apart for crusty sides, touching for soft sides. Bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. *If using self-rising flour, omit baking powder and salt.

      <li>Preheat the oven to 450. Grease on 8-inch square baking pan or small baking sheet. Put the flour, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the vegetable shortening and toss it to coat with the flour. Break the chunk into 5 or 6 smaller chunks and start rubbing the flour and shortening together with your fingers and letting the mixture fall back into the bowl. This does not take long; when the mixture looks like irregular lumps you have mixed enough. Add the milk all at once and stir to moisten all the flour and shortening. Dust a surface with flour, turn the dough onto the surface and knead the dough ten times. Pat the dough into a circle about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick. Cut the biscuits with a two-inch cookie cutter and place on the prepared pan with a little space between the biscuits. Bake 15-18 minutes or until the tops are lightly browned. Serve hot with butter and honey.

Using half of filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to prevent from drying out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased 13x9" baking sheet. Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly with nut mixture. Place remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing after every third sheet and top sheet. 2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form pattern of about 35 diamond shapes. Bake at 400'F. 25 minutes or until golden. Place on wire rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup evenly over top and allow to soak several hours. Stud each diamond-shape with whole clove. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>
