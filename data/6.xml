    <title>Bagels with Variations I</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 1/2 cups All-purpose flour; approximately</li>
      <li>1 package Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Warm water; (120x to 130x)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine 2 cups of the flour and the yeast. Add warm water, 3 tbsp of the sugar, and 1 tsp of salt. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a spoon, stir in as much remaining flour as you can. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough reamining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6-8 min total). Cover; let rest 10 min. Working quickly, divide dough into 12 portions. ***Shape each into a smooth ball. Punch a hole in the center of each ball. Pull dough gently to make a 2" hole, keeping bagel uniformly shaped.*** Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover; let rise 20 min. Broil raised bagels about 5" from heat for 3-4 min, turning once (tops should not brown). Meanwhile, in a 12" skillet or 4 1/2 qt. Dutch oven bring 6 cups water and remaining 1 tbsp sugar to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer bagels, four or five at a time, for 7 min, turning once. Drain on paper towels. Place on well-greased baking sheet. Bake at 375x for 25 to 30 min ortill tops are golden brown. Makes 12 bagels. VARIATIONS LIGHT RYE BAGELS: Stir 1 tsp caraway seed in with the yeast. Substitute 1 1/2 cups rye flour for 1 1/2 cups of the stirred-in flour. HERB BAGELS: Stir 1 1/2 tsp dried basil, crushed; 1 1/2 tsp dried dillweed; or 1-1 1/2 tsp garlic powder in with the yeast. ONION BAGELS: Stir 2 tbsp dried minced onion and, if desired, 2 tbsp cooked bacon pieces into the flour with the yeast. WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS: Substitute 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 cups of the stirred-in flour. Add 3/4 cup of raisins if desired. NOTES : ** I prefer to roll the dough in a rope and wrap it around my hand to form the bagels. Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #495 by Rhonda &lt;layla696@ix.netcom.com&gt; on Jan 8, 1998</li>

    <title>Bagels with Variations Ii</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>18</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 packages Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 cups Warm water; (about 110 degrees F)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>5 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>3 quarts Water</li>
      <li>Cornmeal</li>
      <li>1 Egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in sugar and salt; gradually mix in 4 cups of the flour. Beat well to make a stiff dough. Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until smooth and satiny (about 10 to 20 minutes), adding flour as needed to prevent sticking - dough should be firmer than for most other yeast breads. Place dough in a greased bowl; turn over to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled (about 40 minutes). Punch dough down; knead briefly on a lightly floured board to release air, then divide into 18 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball by gently kneading. Holding ball with both hands, poke your thumbs through center. With one thumb in the hole, work around perimeter, shaping bagel like a doughnut, 2 1/2 to 3 inches across. Place shaped bagels on a lightly floured boards, cover lightly, and let stand in a warm place for 20 minutes. Bring sugar-water mixture to boiling in a 4 or 5-quart pan; adjust heat to keep it boiling gently. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets (at least 12 by 15 inches) and sprinkle with cornmeal. With a slotted spatula, lift one bagel at a time and lower into water; boil 5 or 6 at a time, turning often, for 5 minutes. Lift out of pan, drain briefly on a towel, and place on baking sheet. Brush bagels with egg yolk mixture. Bake in a preheated 400 F degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until well browned and crusty. Let cool on a rack. Makes 18 bagels. WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS Follow directions for bagels, but omit the 3 tablespoons sugar, use 3 tablespoons honey instead. In place of the flour use 2 cups whole wheat or graham flour, 1/2 cup wheat germ, and about 2 1/2 cups all- purpose flour. Mix in all the whole wheat flour and wheat germ and 1 1/4 cups of the all-purpose flour before beating dough. Then mix in about 1 1/2 cups more all-purpose flour; knead and finish as directed. PUMPERNICKEL BAGELS Follow directions for bagels, but omit the 3 tablespoons sugar; use 3 tablespoons dark molasses instead. In place of the flour use 2 cups rye flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour or graham flour, and about 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. Add all the rye and 1 cup each of the whole wheat and all-purpose flour before beating dough. Then add remaining 1 cup whole wheat and about 3/4 cup more all-purpose flour; knead and finish as directed. OTHER BAGEL VARIETIES Add 1/2 cup instant toasted onion to Bagels or Whole Wheat Bagels - add it to yeast mixutre along with the sugar and salt. Or sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon poppy seeds or sesame seeds or 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt on each glazed bagel before baking. Or add 1 tablespoon caraway seeds to Pumpernickel Bagels, then sprinkle each glazed bagel with 1/4 teaspoon more caraway seeds before baking.

      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>4 cups Flour; (4 to 4.5)</li>
      <li>1 cup Water; Boiling potato wate</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Salad oil</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine yeast, salt, 2 teaspoons sugar and 1 1/2 cups flour in a large bowl. Heat potato water and salad oil in saucepan over low heat until very warm (120 - 130F). At low speed, beat this liquid into dry ingredients until just blended. Increase speed to medium and beat 2 minutes, scraping down bowl. Beat in 2 eggs and 1/2 cup flour to form a thick batter. Beat 2 minutes and scrape down bowl. Stir in about 2 cups flour to make a soft dough. Knead on lightly floured board until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Add more flour while kneading, as needed. Shape dough into ball and place in greased bowl; turn dough over to grease top. Cover with moist towel and rise in warm place until double, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough and cut dough into 16 pieces on lightly floured surface. Cover with moist towel and rest for 20 minutes. Roll each piece into 8 inch long strip. Form into rings and place 2 inches apart on 2 greased cookie sheets. Cover with moist towel and let rise in warm place for 30 minutes (dough will NOT be doubled). Preheat oven to 425F. In a 12 inch skilled, bring 1 inch of water and 2 tablespoons sugar to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and drop a few rings in at a time and simmer for 3 minutes, turning once. Remove rings to paper towels. Drain. Place on cookie sheets. Beat remaining egg slightly and brush over rings. Bake 20 to 25 minutes until light brown. Cool 5 minutes on wire rack. Cut in half across the width and toast to serve. Makes 16 bagels. &gt;From: Katie E Green &lt;kgreen@u.washington.edu&gt; From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe Recipe By : Washington State Centenial Cookbook</li>

      <li>Let the machine knead the dough once, and then let the dough rise 20 minutes only in the machine. Even if your cycle runs longer, simply remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off the machine. Divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces. Roll each piece into a rope and make it into a circle, pressing the ends together. You may find it necessary to wet one end slightly to help seal the ends together. Place shaped dough on a well greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring about 2 inches of water to a slight boil in a non-aluminum pan. Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water, cooking for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a towel, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried onion bits, etc., and place on the greased baking sheet. Bake in a pre-heated 550 degree oven for 8 minutes. &gt;From: Judith Sherman &lt;als@hpwalk.wal.hp.com&gt; From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe Recipe By : Bread Machine Cookbook, Donna Rathmell German</li>

      <li>Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 10:27:58 -0400 (EDT) From: "Judith E. Thomas" &lt;jethomas@mailbox.syr.edu&gt; I came up with this because I don't eat dairy and wanted something to put on my bagels :-) Put all but the currants in a blender and blend until smooth. If it is not thick enough, you can add a mixture of cornstarch and water that have been heated and thickened to the mixture. Add soymilk if it's too thick. I always have the tofu in my freezer; it doesn't *have* to be frozen first, but it should be well drained. FATFREE DIGEST V96 #158 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a heavy saucepan, simmer cream with 2 garlic cloves until reduced to 1 cup. 2. Place reduced cream, anchovies and cayenne in blender and puree. 3. Bring sauce to a simmer and add butter, stirring until melted. 4. Serve in a hot chafing dish accompanied with chilled, raw vegetables and homemade (if possible) sourdough `grissini'. TIP: If butter and cream separate, pour in a bit of cold cream and whisk hard. The sauce will regain its velvety texture. This is a dish to be enjoyed without ceremony. Pick up vegetables or breadsticks - grissini - with your fingers and dip into the sauce until well covered; consume. GENOA S.E. BELMONT, PORTLAND.

Even if your cycle runs longer, simply remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off the machine. Divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces. Each piece should be rolled into a rope and made into a circle, pressing the ends together. You may find it necessary to wet one end slightly to help seal the ends together. Place these on a well greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring to a slight boil in a "nonaluminum pan", (Donna German uses a cast iron frying pan) about 2 inches of water. Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water, cooking for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a towel, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or dried onion bits if desired and place on the greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 550 degree oven for 8 minutes.

Knead until smooth and elastic, adding as little flour as necessary, about 8-10 minutes. (don't skimp on the kneading!) Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, put in warm place to rise until doubled in size. (45-60 minutes. Watch carefully.) Punch down dough and divide into 12 equal portions (about 3-4 oz each. Weigh dough on a kitchen scale for accuracy and even size.) Form into smooth balls, gently pulling sides of dough down and tucking ends underneath. Place on floured surface. Let rest 10 minutes. Using a finger or wooden spoon handle, punch a hole in the center of each piece and twirl or stretch into a bagel shape. Cover with a towel and let rest 20-30 minutes. Bring to a boil 6 cups of water, 1 Tbsp sugar and 1 Tbsp salt in a large shallow pan. Gently drop 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the simmering water. Poach first side 2 minutes, turn to cook other side 2 minutes. Remove bagels from water with a slotted spoon and place on a towel to cool. Over the sink, brush each bagel with egg white wash (1 egg white mixed with 1 Tbsp water). You may now sprinkle bagel with salt, poppy seeds, minced garlic or onion, sesame seeds, whatever suits your fancy. Place bagels on a greased baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. If you like your crust crispy rather than chewy, bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes, then brush on the egg wash and sprinkle with desired topping and return bagels to oven for 20 minutes more. Remove from baking sheet and cool on wire racks. * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627. Posted by FAYLEN Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #705 by Lisa Clarke &lt;lisa@gaf.com&gt; on Aug 1, 9</li>

    <title>Bagel and Roasted Sweet Red Pepper Sandwich</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Bagel; sliced, (preferably nice and fresh from a bagel bakery)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fatfree cream cheese</li>
      <li>Roasted Sweet Red Pepper pieces</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>One of my favorite lowfat quick lunches is a sandwich made of: I found these terrific roasted red peppers in a jar in a grocery store I was sauntering through during my travels one day. The brand name is Roland and they say Italian Style Fire Roasted Peppers. The ingredients are peppers, water, salt, ascorbic acid. They have a little bit of blackened skin so they are tastier than the usual jarred ones. I've found other brands that are like these, also, usually at specialty markets or larger groceries. Of course, you can roast your own, too. There are alot of calories in the bagels and this is extremely filling, so you might want to have a half of a sandwich. Use as many pepper slices as you can fit on the sandwich - there are only about 10-20 calories per slice (depending on how big the pieces are) and no fat. If you want, add sliced onions, cukes or other vegetables - whatever you can fit. If packing for lunch, wrap securely in waxed paper and/or a zip lock bag to keep the moisture from dripping out. Take a big napkin! ENJOY!! Posted to EAT-LF Digest by "Natalie Frankel" &lt;Natalie.Frankel@mixcom.com&gt; on Apr 4, 1998</li>

    <title>Bagel Recipe for Bread Maker</title>
    <category>Bagels</category>
    <category>Bread machi</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Yeast</li>
      <li>2 cups Bread flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Barley malt syrup</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Poppy seeds; *NOTE</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*NOTE sesame seeds, kosher salt, or minced onion, or whatever! 1. Add all ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the order suggested by your bread machine. Process on the manual cycle. 2. At the end of the cycle, remove the dough from the machine. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. 3. While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 12 inches long. Make a circle of each piece, overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or rolling the overlap tightly to seal. Let the bagels rise for only 5 minutes. 4. Add the malt syrup to the boling water. Lower the bagels a few at a time into the water. As soon as the bagels rise to the top, remove them with a spatula and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with .75 teaspoon of any of the toppings over each bagel and bake for 20 minutes, or until golden. NOTES: I couldn't find barley malt syrup, so I used molasses. It seems to work in almost the same way. I make 4 bagels out of this recipe, instead of 8. They seem to be the same size as the kind you would buy in the store if there are 4 of them. If you want them smaller, make 8. Enjoy!

      <li>Poppy seed or sesame seed; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>You are absolutely correct on both counts - they are both easy and delightfully delicious. This is the recipe I have been using to make homemade bagels since the '60's. This recipe comes from an absolutely marvelous little cookboo (currently in reprint) named "Love and Knishes" authored by Sara Kasden, and sub titled "How to Cook Like a Jewish Mother". It's full of great recipes as well as top notch humor. Sift together dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Soften yeast in one third of the potato water. Add to the flour. Add oil to the remaining potato water and stir into the flour. Add eggs and stir briskly to form a ball of dough. Knead on a lightly floured board for 10 minutes. This must be a firm dough; add more flour if necessary. Return to the bowl, smooth side up. Cover with a tea towel and let rise at room temperature until the dough rises to the top of the bowl. Knead again on a lightly floured board until smooth and elastic (as for rolls). Pinch off pieces of dough and roll between the palms to form ropes about 6 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Pinch the ends together firmly to make a doughnut shape. Add sugar to boiling water. Drop bagels into the water one at a time. As they come to the surface, turn them over. Boil 1 minute longer on the second side. Place on a greased cooky sheet and bake at 450 until the crust is golden brown and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Bagels may be sprinkled with poppy seed or sesame seed before baking, if desired. Makes about 30. * Potato water is water in which potatoes have been boiled. Plain water may be used in it's place, but bagels are better with potato water! Posted to EAT-L Digest by BirdsEtc &lt;BirdsEtc@AOL.COM&gt; on Jan 7, 1998</li>

Remove pan from bread maker, then remove dough and place into a lightly greased bowl, cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. 5. Remove dough from refrigerator and place on lightly floured surface. Roll out into a rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. For bagels, divide dough into 8 equal pieces: for bagelettes, divide dough into 16 equal pieces. 6. Form each piece of dough into a ball. punch hole in center with finger, then stretch dough until center hole is 1 or 2 inches in diameter, depending on size bagel being made. Place formed bagels on greased cookie sheet about 2 inchs apart. Brush lightly with cold water, cover and let rise in warm draft-free place for 30 - 40 minutes or until almost double in size. 7. Bring 3 quarts water to boil in 5 quart dutch oven. Add sugar and stir to dissolve. Reduce heat to simmer and carefully add 2 - 3 bagels or 4 - 5 bagelettes to hot water. Simmer for 3-4 minutes on each side. Remove with slotted spoon, drain, then place on greased baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with poppy seeds or sesame seeds if desired, or leave plain. Bake in preheated 450 degree oven for 12-15 minutes. Remove, turn bagels over and bake on second side for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly before serving. NOTES : I brown onions and garlic, drain good and put on bagels before cooking, great.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Directions--Conventional method (if using a bread machine, put in ingredients in order specified by machine manufacturer) In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in the malt and sugar, then the salt and flour. Knead the dough til smooth (by hand, mixer or machine). Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly greased bowl covered with lightly greased plastic wrap (I use an inverted plate) and allow to rise til doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours (this is the "Dough Cycle" on the bread machine) When the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface. Put the water for the bath into a large, shallow pan--the water should be about 3 inches deep (I use a stock- pot &amp; the water is usually about 6 in. deep)--and add the malt and sugar. Bring the water to a boil while you're shaping the bagels. Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape it into a ball, poke a hole through the center with your index finger, and work into a hole; the dough will form a ring. Place the bagels on a parchment-lined, lightly greased or cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheet as you shape them. Boil immediately (*don't* let them rise a second time--they tend to totally collapse when they get boiled if you do). Reduce the boiling water bath to a very gentle simmer. Gently transfer the bagels, 3 or 4 at a time, to the water bath; don't crowd them. Simmer them for about 30 sec. on each side, then return to the baking sheet. Bake the bagels in a preheated 425 deg. oven for 20 min. or until they're a deep golden brown. Yield 16-20 bagels, depending on size. Options: After boiling, but before baking, brush bagels with an egg-&amp;-water wash &amp; sprinkle poppy seeds, caraway seeds, sesame seeds, coarse salt, dehydrated onion, etc. For flavored bagels (like onion, rye or garlic) add ingredients to the dough before kneading. Bits of cooked spinach or fresh chive or garlic, diced onions, cinnamon and raisins are all popular. EAT-L Digest 7 August 96 From the EAT-L recipe list.

Place yeast in a warm bowl and add the water, stirring to dissolve. Add malted milk powder and sugar and stir until dissolved. Add salt and flour all at once. Work the dough with fingers and hands, kneading into a stiff dough. Or use a mixer equipped with a dough hook. 2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in an ungreased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk. 3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. 4. Bring the ingredients for the water bath to a boil. 5. Punch the dough down and divide into 16 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball. Pierce the center of each ball with thumb and index finger. Using fingers, shape each ball into a ring like a doughnut. 6. If the water bath is boiling, turn off the heat. When the bagels are dropped into it, the water should be just below the boiling point. 7. Drop the bagel rounds into the just-under-boiling water and let them cook for about 20 seconds on each side. Remove the rounds from the water using a slotted spoon. 8. Place the bagel rounds on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 15-17 minutes or until lightly browned. Eat fresh or store in freezer.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(Source: Secrets of a Jewish Baker, by George Greenstein) In a large bowl sprinkle the yeast over the warm water to soften; stir to dissolve. Add the 2 tablespoons malt syrup, oil, 6 cups flour and salt. Mix thoroughly until the dough forms up and comes away fro the sides of the bowl. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead, adding small amounts of flour as necessary. Bagel dough should be stiff. Work in as much extra flour as you can comfortably knead. When using bread flour the dough will soften slightly as the gluten develops. Knead until smooth and elastic (12 to 15 minutes). Rising: Roll the dough into a ball, place it in a large oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover and let fully rise until an impression made with your finger remains and does not sink into the dough (about 1 hour). Punch down, cut into thirds, and roll each piece between your palms into a rope. Shaping: Cut each rope into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls. Roll the first ball into a rope 2 inches more than the width of your hand. Flip the rope around your fingers to form a ring, with the ends overlapping about 1/2 inch. Seal the ends by rolling with your palms on a work top. If the dough slides and resists rolling, dab on a drop of water with your fingers. Evenly space the bagels on 2 nonstick baking pans or very lightly oiled baking sheets. I apply a thin film with my fingers. Cover and let stand until puffy (about 20 minutes). Boiling: Bagles are boiled before they are baked. While they are proofing, fill a 4-quart saucepan two-thirds full with cold water; add the 1 tablespoon malt syrup and bring to a boil. Have ready pans or dishes contianing poppy seeds, sesame seeds, coarse salt, or other toppings (see note). When ready to cook the bagels, drop two or three at a time into the boiling water and wait until they rise to the top. Cook for a total of 1 minute, turning once. If they have been proofed too long, they will float instead of sinking but you can continue without too much difference. Carefully lift out each bagel with a slotted spoon or skimmer. Drain momentarily, then turn them over into the dish of prepared seeds. You may prefer to leave some plain. Evenly space the bagels on 2 baking sheets, topping side up. Baking: Bake with steam (see note) in a preheated 500F oven until well browned (15 to 20 minutes). Turn them over when the tops begin to brown. Continue baking until done. Makes 1 dozen large bagels. Note: (from author) Malt syrup adds gloss and a subtle flavor to the finished bagel. If you can find malt syrup in your supermarket or natural foods store, use it. The toppings for bagels are virtually unlimited. Try poppy seeds, sesame seeds, coarse salt, poppy seeds and coarse salt combined, minced onion flakes, or chopped or granulated garlic. To bake with steam: Place an empty roasting pan or other heavy pan on the floor of the oven 5 to 10 minutes before baking, so it gets hot. When ready to bake, place the bread/bagels in the oven and carefully toss six to eight ice cubes into the hot pan, or pour in 1 cup boiling water and immediately close the oven door. Note: (from Peggy M.) I use high-gluten flour instead of the bread flour for this recipe. It can be purchased through several flour companies - I get it from King Arthur's Baking Catalog. I also use 1 TABLESPOON of yeast, rather than the amount he calls for. It is the amount called for in another bagel recipe I used to make, and I've found it works better in this one, as well. Also, I use malt powder and corn syrup in place of the malt syrup. Both malt powder and malt syrup are available through catalogs, again I order it through King Arthur's Baking Catalog.

      <li>From: hz225wu@unidui.uni-duisburg.de (Micaela Pantke) Date: Tue, 27 Jul 93 13:11:54 +0200 From: Barry_Carlson@mindlink.bc.ca (Moira Carlson) The dough used for bagels is basically a bread dough recipe. The secret is that you boil the bagels before baking them in the oven. In a bowl put the warm water, yeast and sugar. Let stand for 10 minutes until the yeast is working. Add the salt, egg, oil and flour and stir everything together. Dump the dough out on a floured board and knead until everything is of one consistancy. (Exactly like making bread). Put the dough into a warm bowl and put (covered) in a draft-free place for about 1 and 1/2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Punch down the dough and divide it into 20 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball. Then roll each ball into a rope (like you would plasticine) about 7 inches long. Press the two ends of the "rope" together to give you the basic bagel shape. Put the bagels on a floured board, cover with a tea towel, and leave for about an hour to rise. During the last part of the rising time, put a pot on the stove and fill it with boiling water. Also turn the oven on to 375 Degrees F. Dump about 5 bagels at a time into the boiling water. They will fall to the bottom of the pot and then rise. When they rise turn them over. Boil them for a total (including time at bottom of pan) of 2 minutes. Lift the bagels out of the water with a slotted spoon and leave them to drain while you do remaining bagels. Put all the bagels on a cookie sheet and put them in the oven to bake for about 15 minutes (Until they turn brown). Enjoy. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

Cut or chop into small bits. Shred the cheese. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Stir cornmeal into the cold water in the saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a bubbling boil, stirring constantly. When it is thick-perhaps 60 seconds-remove from heat. Stir in the cheese, butter, garlic and salt. When cheese is melted pour in the milk. Stir in egg yolks and add bacon bits. Beat egg whites stiff, and fold them into the batter. pour into the casserole or souffle dish (one 2-quart casserole or souffle dish, greased). Level the batter with rubber spatula. Bake in the oven for about 1 hour. The bread will be nicely browned, high and puffy. Slip a knife blade into the center of the casserole. If the blade comes out clean and dry, the spoon bread is done. If not, return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes. Remove bread from the oven. Serve while hot.

(At this point the dough can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. Bring it to room temperature before proceeding.) 4. Let the dough rest for ten minutes. Pull of pieces of dough to form 12 two inch balls. Poke a finger through the ball, making a hole the size of a golf ball. With fingers, shape the bagel evenly. Put the bagels on a cookie sheet, cover with oiled plastic wrap, and let them rise until puffy, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 5. Bring 4 qts. water to boil in a wide pot. Add the remaining two teaspoons sugar. Poach the bagels, 3 or 4 at a time, for 30 seconds. Turn them and poach for 30 seconds more. Remove with slotted spoon, let drip briefly on towel and the place 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Brush each bagel with a little of the egg glaze. (At this point sprinkle on any of the optional salt or seeds.) Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool on racks. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Bagels Pt 1</title>
    <category>Daily</category>
    <category>Loaves</category>
    <quantity>10</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Unsalted butter; melted</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups Tepid water; (80¡F to 90¡F)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Solid vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Fresh ground black pepper; optional</li>
      <li>6 cups High-gluten flour; bread flour, or unbleached flour</li>
      <li>Makes 10 large bagels.</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Like croissants, bagels, have transcended their origins to become all-American. These are chubby bagels - boiled, then baked - with a cakey, open sponge; they are not heavy, stretchy, or chewy. They are made with high-gluten flour, the kind your local pizza maker uses. He might give you some, or you can order the flour by mail, but don't let not getting your hands on this stop you from bageling - you'll like what you get if you use bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour. Brush the inside of a large (about 8-quart) bowl with some of the melted butter; set aside. Reserve the remaining melted butter for coating the top of the dough. Mixing and Kneading: Whisk the yeast into 1/4 cup of the tepid water. Add a pinch of sugar and let the mixture rest until the yeast has dissolved and is creamy. Pour the remaining 2 cups water into a large bowl and add the shortening. Add the yeast mixture along with 2 tablespoons sugar, the salt, and the black pepper, if you're using it, and stir with a wooden spoon to mix. Stirring vigorously with the wooden spoon, add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stopping when you have a soft, sticky dough that is difficult to stir. (You will probably use almost 6 cups of flour, but the dough will still be soft and sticky - and that's just the way it's supposed to be.) Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 to 6 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. Add additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to you hands and the works surface. (To make the dough in a mixer, proof the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water in the mixer's bowl. Fit the machine with the dough hook and add the remaining 2 cups water, the sugar, shortening, salt, and the pepper, if using it; mix on low to blend. With the machine still on low, gradually add 5 1/2 to 6 cups of the flour, mixing for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the ingredients are blended. With the machine still on low, gradually add 5 1/2 to 6 cups of the flour, mixing for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the ingredients are blended. Increase the miser speed to medium and knead for about 6 minutes, adding additional four by the tablespoon until the dough is smooth and elastic. At this point, the dough may still be slightly sticky and it may not clean the sides and bottom of the bowl completely - that's OK.) Rise: Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to the buttered mixing bowl. Brush the top of the dough with a little melted butter, cover the bowl with buttered plastic wrap, and top with a kitchen towel. Let the dough rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in bulk. Chilling the Dough: Deflate the dough, cover as before, and refrigerate for 4 hours, or, if it's more convenient, overnight. *** At this point, the dough can be well wrapped and refrigerated for up to 2 days. *** When you're ready to make the bagels, position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 500¡F. If the bagels are to bake on a stone, preheat the baking stone too and generously dust a peel with cornmeal. If they will bake on baking sheets, brush the sheets with vegetable oil (or spray them) and dust them with cornmeal. For added flavor, use one or all of the suggested topping ingredients in combination with the cornmeal to dust the peel or the sheets. (To create steam in the oven, you'll be tossing ice cubes and water onto the oven floor. If you don't think you oven floor is up to this - it can be tricky with a gas oven ~ put a heavy skillet or roasting pan on the oven floor and preheat it as well.) While the oven preheats, fill a stockpot with water and bring the water to a rapid boil. Line 2 baking sheets or trays with kitchen towels. Rub flour into 1 of the towels and place both sheets close to your work surface. Shaping the Dough: Deflate the dough and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough in half; cover and chill one piece of the dough while you work with the other. Cut the dough into 5 equal pieces; work with 1 piece at a time and cover the remaining pieces with a towel. continued in part 2</li>

      <li>Bottled taco sauce</li>
      <li>Guacamole</li>
      <li>Sour cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large skillet, pour in some oil and gently cook the onion for about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and meat to the onion and fry for a few minutes. Add the spices and herbs with salt and pepper to taste, and mix well, continuing to fry until the meat is fully cooked. Drain and keep warm. If you are using tortillas, wrap them in tin foil and warm in a low oven for a few minutes until soft. Spoon some of the meat mixture into a tortilla and garnish with any or all of the garnishes. Put the "drier" items on first, followed by the "wetter" ones. Fold the tortilla over and eat. It is important not to overfill the tortillas or it all falls apart. If you are using taco shells, follow the same procedure (except for the folding bit) and caution. The most interesting way to eat these is to vary the toppings so that each taco is a new taste sensation. Serve with refried beans and a beer. Serves 2. Formatted by Lynn Thomas dcqp82a@prodigy.com. Source: The Harley Biker's Cookbook: Big Bites For Hungry Bikers by Owen Rossan. Lynn's notes: Made this 12-8-97; omitted oil and cooked the beef, garlic and onion at the same time. Added 1/2 can refried beans to meat mixture after cooking. This was a very good taco--make it as spicy as you want.

      <li>1 pound Bacon; thick-sliced and lean</li>
      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>1 pound Baking potatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>8 Eggs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut the bacon slices into square pieces. Fry the pieces until well-cooked, then drain on paper towels. Peel the potatoes, then grate them. To prevent the grated potatoes from discoloring while you prepare the other ingredients, you can put them into a bowl of cold water. When you're ready to use them, be sure to drain well and squeeze them dry. Grate the cheese. Mince the onion. Butter a 9x13 inch shallow baking dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Add all the other ingredients and stir. Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature. NOTES: * A brunch casserole with potatoes, eggs, bacon and cheese -- This is a very easy brunch dish, similar to a fritatta in texture, but full of traditional breakfast ingredients. The recipe comes from a cookbook published by the _Contra Costa (California) Times_ newspaper, called "Tastes of the Times." Yield: Serves 4-6. * It really does make a difference if you use good meaty bacon for this. I find the best bacon at my local butcher shop. * You can prepare part of this ahead. I think egg dishes are better if they haven't been refrigerated. So if you want to work ahead, you can cook the bacon, grate the cheese and potatoes and mince the onion the night before. Store all these things separately in the refrigerator, covering the potatoes with water. Then in the morning just mix it all up and bake it. : Difficulty: moderate (tedious). : Time: 30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling. : Precision: approximate measurement OK. : Vicki O'Day : Hewlett Packard Laboratories : oday@hplabs.hp.com : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1056 by "M.

    <title>Bagels Pt 2</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>See part 1</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To form a bagel and develop the gluten, cloak that will give it its structure, draw up the dough from the bottom, stretch it, and pinch it at the top. Keep pulling the dough up and pinching it until you have a perfectly round, tightly packed ball of dough with a little topknot or pleat at the top. Turn the dough over so that the knot is against the work surface and plunge your index finger into the center of the dough. Wiggle your finger around in the hole to stretch it, then lift the bagel, hook it over the thumb of one hand and the index finger of the other, and start rotating the dough, circling your thumb and finger and elongating the hole to a diameter of 2 to 2 1/2 inches. (At this point, the dough will look more like a piece in a ringtoss game then a bagel, but it will soon boil to bagelhood.) Put the bagel on the baking sheet with the floured towel, and cover with another towel. Shape the remaining 4 pieces of dough into bagels. (You'll shape the refrigerated dough after you've completed boiling and baking there bagels.) The Water Bath: 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon baking soda Add the sugar and baking soda to the boiling water. With a large slotted skimming spoon or slotted spatula, lower the bagels, one at a time, into the boiling water. Don't crowd them - the bagels should swim around in the water without touching one another; it's better to boil them in batches than to cram them into the pot all at one time. The bagels will sink to the bottom of the pot when you put them in, then rise to the top. Once the bagels have surfaced, boil for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, flipping them over gently with the skimmer. Remove the bagels, shaking the skimmer over the stockpot to get rid of some of the excess water, and put them on the baking sheet with the unfloured towel, keeping the smoothest side of the bagel up. (Do not discard the sugar-water - you'll use it to boil the dough that is still in the refrigerator.) Keeping the smoothest side up, transfer the bagels to the peel or prepared baking sheet. (Work quickly, because the wet bagels have a tendency to stick to the towel.) The Glaze and Toppings: 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon water, Sesame, poppy, and/or caraway seeds; kosher or sea salt; minced onions sautŽed in vegetable oil; and/or dried garlic chips or dehydrated onions softened in hot water (optional) Whisk the egg whites and cold water together until the whites are broken up, then push the glaze through a sieve and brush each bagel with the glaze. Try not to let the glaze drip onto the baking sheet or peel, or it will glue down the bagels. Don't worry if the bagels look wrinkled - they'll smooth out in the oven. Brush with another coat of glaze and, if you're using a topping, or more than one, sprinkle it, or them, evenly over the bagels now. Baking the Bagels: Put 4 ice cubes in a 1-pint measuring cup and add 1/4 cup cold water. Put the bagels into the oven and immediately toss the ice cubes and water onto the oven floor (or into the hot pan). Quickly close the oven door to capture the steam produced by the ice, turn the oven temperature down to 450¡F, and bake the bagels for 25 minutes. Turn off the oven and let the bagels remain in the oven for 5 more minutes. Open the oven door and leave the bagels in the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the bagels to a rack and cool. If you've used a baking stone, sweep the excess cornmeal from the stone. Before baking the next batch of bagels, be certain to bring the oven temperature back to 500¡F. While the first batch of bagels is baking, cut and shape the remaining dough. Boil, glaze, and bake these bagels just as you did the first batch. Storing: Cooled bagels can be kept for 1 day in a paper bag. For longer storage, pack into airtight plastic bags and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature. Bagel Chips: Cut stale bagels into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Spread lightly with softened herb butter and sprinkle with coarse salt. Place on a wire rack set in a jelly-roll pan and bake in a preheated 375¡F oven until uniformly crisp and golden brown. Start checking after 10 minutes; remove any chips that are crisp and brown and keep baking the others. The chips will probably need about 15 minutes in the oven, but some slow-crispers might take up to 20 minutes. Cool on a rack and store in an airtight tin.

      <li>From "The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever", by Madge Rosenberg 1. Add all ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the dough cycle according to the manufacturer's directions. 2. at the end of the dough cycle, remove the dough from the machine. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large pot bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. 3. While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a roll 12 inches long. Make a circle of each piece, overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or rolling the overlap tightly to seal. Let the bagels rise for only 5 minutes. 4. Add the malt syrup to the boiling water. (The syrup gives the bagels their golden color.) Lower a few bagels at a time into the boiling water. As soon as the bagels rise to the top, remove with a skimmer or spatula to a lightly greased baking sheet. Sprinkle about 3/4 tsp. of any of the toppings over each bagel and bake 20 minutes, or until golden. From: Dan Ceppa</li>

      <li>Marinade: Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Chicken: Mix chicken and marinade together in a large bowl and refrig- erate for 30 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and lightly coat chicken with flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned. Remove from skillet and keep warm. In the same skillet, add mushrooms, wine and 6 tablespoons of the ginger sauce. Simmer over medium low heat for 5 minutes. Do not over cook. In a blender, blend the first 8 ingredients together until smooth, then add the red pepper flakes and the sesame oil and blend well. Refrigerate. Crepes: Beat the eggs well. Beat in the milk, salt, flour and the melted butter until smooth, or in a blender all together. Let stand 30 minutes before cooking. Heat a 10-inch skillet until fairly hot, but not smoking. Film with butter. Use a small measuring cup or pour several tablespoons of the batter into the pan. Quickly tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly in the pan. Cook until lightly browned. Turn with a spatula and cook other side for about 30 seconds. Stack the crepes, using a sheet of waxed paper between each cooked crepe. To assemble: Remove the chicken from the warming dish and cut into bite-sized pieces. In the center of a cooked crepe, using a slotted spoon put one-sixth of the cooked mushrooms, one-sixth of the cooked chicken, 1 tablespoon of the ginger sauce and a sprinkle of chopped green onion. On a serving dish, spoon some of the juice from the cooked mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of the ginger sauce. Pull up the sides of the filled crepe to form a bag. Then tie the top of the crepe with a strand of the green onion, to hold the crepe upright. Put the crepe on the juices in the serving dish. Garnish with 1 drained peach half, several sprigs of the watercress and some sliced green onion. -- Wallace Harton, New Orleans per Fred Towner Submitted By SAM WARING &lt;SAM.WARING@382-91-12.IMA.INFOMAIL.COM&gt; On MON, 20 NOV 1995 145826 GMT From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>From: viv@tauon.ph.unimelb.edu.au (Viviane Buzzi) Date: 24 Dec 1994 00:22:16 -0500 from "Grand Finales" by Vogue Australia: Prepare 1 day ahead of serving. Serves 10 To make the bavarois: beat the egg yolks with sugar. Bring the milk to the boil, pour a little into the yolks, mixing well, and pour it back int the saucepan. Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard coats the back of the spoon. Strain into a bowl and add vanilla essence to taste. Dissolve the gelatine in a little water and add it to the mixture, stirring well. Beat in the chestnut puree. Set the mixture aside to cool thoroughly. Fold in the cream with a large balloon whisk. Lightly oil a pretty mould and pour in the bavarois. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. To prepare the garnish: place the chocolate in a bowl set over hot water. Let the chocolate just melt and stir it well to avoid melting the nougat in the chocolate. Dip the marrons in the chocolate and place them on a cake cooler to harden. Store the marrons in an airtight container. To make the creme anglaise: beat the egg yolks with sugar. Bring the milk to the boil and pour a little into the yolks, mixing well. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook slowly until the custard coats the back of a spoon. Strain into a bowl and leave to cool. Add vanilla essence to taste. Cover and refrigerate. To serve: turn the bavarois out onto a flat serving plate. Spoon creme anglaise around it, and garnish with chocolate coated marron glaces. My notes: you could make it more heady by flavouring the creme anglaise with rum instead of vanilla and perhaps use some thin chocolate sauce to make a nice butterflied pattern through the creme anglaise on the plate. Looks very elegant. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /MISC From rec.food.cooking archives. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <title>Bavarian Roast Suckling Pig Part 2</title>

      <li>See below</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Lay pig on a rack or across two long wooden inverted spoons in open roasting pan. Pour in enough water to cover bottom of pan. To keep pig well greased as it roasts, either brush it every 10 to 15 minutes with melted buttr or bacon fat, or lay strips of bacon across its back and replace them as they become crisp; or rub pig with a large, unsliced chunk of bacon. Place pig in a preheated oven and allow 25 to 30 minutes per pound for roasting, using either seaing or even- temperature method described above. Brush or rub with fat every 10 to 15 minutes and add more water to pan as needed. When you baste, prick skin again to keep fat draining. If pig browns too quicky, cover it with greased brown paper or a double thickness of aluminum foil and lift this cover for basting. When there is till 1/2 hour cooking time left, remove paper from ears and tail, and from pig itself if it has been covered. Continue roasting and basted 4 or 5 times with beer to give skin a crisp golden glaze. To serve pig, cut trussing from legs and place pig on a large wooden carving board or platter. Remove the block or potato from mouth and put in a whole small apple or unpeeled lemon. Show whole pig at the table, but unless you are very skilled and experienced, carve in kitchen. If you want to carve it at the table, cut a circle around the neck, and cover this with a wreath of leaves or, at Christmas, holly. In Bavaria, a very simple gravy is served with this. Skim excess fat from pan juices and add some water or stock if there is very little gravy left. Bring to a boil in roasting pan on stove and scrape coagulated pan juices into gravy with a wooden spoon. Thicken by stirring in flour or cornstarch dissolved in cold water and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or until sauce is smooth and thick. Sour cream can be stirred in for creamier sauce. Season as needed and serve in heated sauceboat. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip</li>

      <li>See recipe: Basic White Bread by James Beard, for instructions on kneading. That is a "real" load of bread! :-) * Instructions * Proof the yeast in the water in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the dry milk, sugar, butter, salt, optional garlic, and 2 cups flour. Beat the batter by hand or with an electric mixer at medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining flour by hand and stir the mixture well to make a soft dough.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In Germany, suckling pig is seared in a hot oven and then roated in moderate heat. To do this, preheat oven to 450 degrees and after 20 minutes, reduce heat to 350 degree. Nevertheless I have found that pigs brown more evenly and shrink less is roasted at even, moderate temperature throughout. To do this, preheat oven to 350 and roast, following instructions below. Allow 25 to 30 minutes per poun for roasting. The meat should be white, without any pink in the juices. Have the pig eviscerated and cleaned by your butcher. Wash it well under running cold water an pat off excess moisture with paper towel. If you do this a day or hours ahead and pig has dried, wipe with damp cloth before seasoning so moisture holds the spices onto skin. Rub inside of pig with salt, marjoram and caraway seeds. Since this pig will not be stuffed, it will siink in slightly as it roasts, so stuff body cavity firmly with crumpled alminum foil or clean white wrapping paper. This is only necessary for appearance of pig when served. The opening along bottom of pig does not have tp be trussed closed. Tie front legs forward so feet come under the head. To tie back legs forward, bring them around under body on each side. Tie securely with kitchen string so they remain in place duri8ng roasting. Rub outside o pig with salt, marjoram and caraway seeds. Cover ears and tail with greased brown paper or double thicknesses of aluminum foil to keep from burning. Prop the mouth open with a block of wood or raw potato, so that you will be able to stuff if with an apple or lemon later. Pierce skin all over with a sharp-pronged fork, a larding needle or skewer, so fat will drain off. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip</li>

    <title>Bavarian Mint Truffles</title>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GANACHE</li>
      <li>8 ounces Dark sweet chocolate</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Creme De Menthe</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: DIPPING</li>
      <li>16 ounces Dark sweet chocolate</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GARNISH</li>
      <li>Green sprinkles for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>from the book Chocolate Truffles by Carrie Huber. Making the Ganache: To prepare ganache, chop or grate chocolate into small pieces. Place in top half of double boiler along with cream. Put hot (not boiling) water in bottom half of a double boiler, making sure the water doesn't touch the top pan. Stir often with wooden spoon. When all of the chocolate has melted, beat until well combined. Remove from heat, let cool to room temperature. Transfer to covered bowl and refrigerate overnight to harden. (Ganache will keep in this state for a few days if necessary.) Take a little ganache at a time and form 1" balls, using fingertips (with as little contact as possible so the chocolate doesn't soften). Keep unused portion refrigerated as you work. Place balls on waxed paper-lined baking sheet; continue until ganache is used up. Refrigerate baking sheet until ganache is hardened, overnight or up to two days. Allow to set in refrigerator at least two hours before loosely covering with waxed paper. Foil can be substituted in all cases for waxed paper, but never use clear plastic wrap. It clings too tightly to the candies and traps moisture inside which discolors the chocolate. Prepare Chocolate Coating: Chop or grate chocolate into small pieces. Heat chocolate and oil together in top of double boiler over hot water, stirring until smooth with a wooden spoon. Insert candy thermometer and begin dipping the ganache balls when temperature registers between 85-90F. If chocolate begins to cool and thicken before you're finished dipping, reheat over hot water. Work with only 1/2 dozen at a time, keeping the rest refrigerated. Drop a single ganache ball into the chocolate, turning to coat well, then lift it with the fork. Allow excess chocolate to drip back into pan, then gently rap fork against edge of pan to remove more chocolate from ball. Failure to do this will cause a large dribbly "platform" or "skirt" to form around the base of each hardened truffle. (this makes it difficult to pack them side by side in a box.) There are two schools of thoughts as to the proper method of depositing truffles onto the baking sheet: A) If you are conservative by nature it's best to gently slide them off the fork with a butterknife, onto the waiting baking sheet. B) If you intend to further decorate the truffle, the second method, (for the show-offs among us) involves dropping the truffle off the fork upside down directly onto the baking sheet. Quickly manipulate the single strand of chocolate, adhering to the fork, into some glorious shape atop the candy, like the pros do. Either way is acceptable, although the second way requires some practice and an accurate thermometer to get it right. If your chocolate temperature is off by a few degrees, you're likely to find a chocolate highway - not a chocolate strand - adhering to the fork when that critical moment comes. The perfect finale for the basic recipes, for instance, is a sprinkling of shaved dark chocolate over the top, or better yet, gently rolling each newly-dipped truffle in the shavings to coat completely. Refrigerate all truffles after dipping several hours or overnight to harden. When chocolate and cream ganache have cooled to room temperature, stir in Creme de Menthe before refrigerating. Sprinkle dipped truffles with green sprinkles. Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #463 by Shelley Sparks &lt;ssparks@mailbox.arn.net&gt; on Dec 20, 1997</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Unsalted butter; (1/2 stick) (melted and cooled)</li>
      <li>White cornmeal</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place instant potatoes in a small bowl, add the scalded milk, and stir to dissolve. In another bowl, mash the yeast and add water and sugar. Stir well and set aside. In a large mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt Add the potato mixture, yeast mixture, and butter. Stir with a spatula until flour is moistened. Using a mixer dough hook, knead mixture for 10 minutes. It should form a ball and pull away from the bottom of the container. Place dough in a fresh, buttered bowl. Cover lightly and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Thinly butter two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans. Add a small amount of the cornmeal to the pans and rotate to evenly coat the interiors. Knock out any excess. Set aside. Punch down and divide dough into 2 equal pieces. On a sparingly floured board, roll out one piece of dough into an 8 x 14-inch rectangle. Brush off any excess flour, then roll into a loaf shape, pinching bottom seam to seal. Place dough, seam side down, in prepared pan. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until dough extends 2 inches above pan. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375F degrees. Bakes loaves in the oven for 34 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. Loaves should make a hollow sound when tapped. Let cool on a wire rack.

      <li>Select fresh tender beets and cut off the tops and roots. Wash the beets, without removing the skins, and boil in a large pot with ample water. Meanwhile, clean the beet greens with the stems; add to the pot after the beets have cooked 30 min. When beets are tender, remove and strain the liquid. Peel the beets and cut them into round slices; chop up the greens. Mound greens in center of a platter and surround them with the beet slices. Pour oil and vinegar over all, and serve. or serve with Skordalia (garlic) Sauce. Serve hot or cold. SKORDALIA SAUCE: Clean garlic and mash it completely (you may use food processor). Mash in potatoes, one by one, until you have a thick paste (the more potatoes you use, the more sauce you get--but less potent). Alternately add the oil and vinegar, beating constantly. If the sauce is too thick for your taste, add a little water or fish or chicken stock. NO LUMPS IN THIS SAUCE, P-L-E-A-S-E !! NOTE: Many people like to add almonds or walnuts to skordalia. These are mashed to a pulp and added to the paste before the potatoes, oil, and vinegar. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Cut the core out of the cabbage. Fill a large pot half-full with water and bring to a boil. Put the cabbage with the core-side down into the water. Boil for a few minutes, then turn head around so core-side is up. Start to carefully remove the outer leaves with a pair of tongs. Try to leave the leaves as whole and undamaged as possible. The stem of the leaves should be soft enough to roll. Remove about 16-18 leaves and set aside on a plate. Leave the rest of the cabbage simmering for about 20 minutes to get the stock for the sauce. Filling: Soak the bread in the milk. Combine soy meat, rice, egg, soaked bread, onion, salt and pepper in a blender and mix well to get a thick paste. Spread one cabbage leaf out on the table in front of you with the stem end towards you. Take 1-2 tablespoons of the filling and place it on the stem end. Carefully roll up the cabbage leaf folding in the sides as well. Put seam facing down in a baking dish. Roll up all the cabbage leaves this way and place tightly next to each other in the dish. Set aside. Sauce: Melt margarine or butter in a heavy saucepan. Add onions and saut=82 until golden brown. Add flour and stir continuously until the flour is roasted and a light brown color. Add the cabbage stock and the spices and bring to a boil. Simmer for a few minutes. The consistency should be thin. If needed, add more stock. Pour this sauce over the cabbage rolls in the baking dish. Put in a preheated oven at 300=F8F. Bake until the cabbage is tender and golden brown. Serve with parslied potatoes and apple sauce. 2 hours to prepare.

      <li>1/2 cups Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix all of the ingredients together and blend until there are no lumps. Preheat the oil in your deep fat fryer to the proper temperature for the food you are cooking. Dry the fish or the vegetables with a paper towel and dip into the batter. Place in the hot oil one piece at a time. Try to keep the pieces from colliding until the batter has had a chance to set (which it does almost instantly). Cook until the batter has turned a golden brown, remove to a paper towel to drain and serve at once. YIELD: enough for about 2 pounds of fish or vegetables NOTES : This is very good to use for zucchini, broccoli, peppers, green beans, onion rings and any other firm vegetable. Barbara Hill says this batter WILL stick to the food. FYI: Pancake mix makes a terriffic batter for just about anything. Or use Bisquick or other baking mix prepared according to package directions for pancakes. Add milk till the consistency reaches that of syrup. Dredge the item in *dry mix* first, shake of excess, then dip in batter and let drain for a few seconds; fry at 365° for fish or chicken nuggets till they float.

    <ingredient>
      <li>8 Peppers (the idea is to mix sweet and hot varities to taste, perhaps a half dozen sweet red peppers, a few slightly hot banana peppers, and a couple jalapeno peppers, depending on what's available in your area. Experiment) (up to 12)</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"Weekend All Things Considered"; so here for the world: Note: Feel free to vary the quantities and ingredients of this recipe to suit your taste. As Bati Restaurant makes it, the salad is slightly spicy, but not too hot, with a definite, but not puckering, vinegar flavor. Preheat oven to 450 degrees Roast peppers on a baking sheet until they soften and blister enough so you can peel them. Put them a brown paper bag or covered pot until they're cool enough to handle; then peel, remove any stems and seeds, and coarsely chop so each chunk is about one to two inches square. Coarsely chop the tomatoes and add to the peppers. Coarsely chop the garlic, then grind with salt using a mortar and pestle or any makeshift tool, until the mixture has turned to paste. Whisk into the vinegar. Whisk the olive oil into the vinegar-garlic mixture, toss with the peppers and tomatoes ... and enjoy! Tarik likes to let the salad sit for a couple hours before serving and then he spoons yoghurt sprinkled with raw minced garlic on top. Goktan, on the other hand, likes to eat his roast pepper salad the moment it's done...dunking big chunks of crusty bread into the vinaigrette as he does so....

      <li>* NOTE: You can omit the butter and increase the salad oil to 2 1/2 cups. Mix the meat, egg, bread crumbs, beer and garlic salt. Shape the mixture into 3/4-inch balls. Prepare the frothy batter. Heat the oil and butter in a metal fondue pot to 375 degrees F. Spear the meatballs with a fondue fork, dip into the batter and cook in the hot oil to the desired doneness, about 2 minutes. Serve with both sauces. NOTE: These meatballs can also be cooked without the batter. FROTHY BATTER: Mix all of the ingredients with a fork. (Batter will be slightly lumpy.) MUSTARD SAUCE AND HORSERADISH SAUCE: Mix all the ingredients together and refrigerate until serving time.

    <title>Batter Fried Sage Leaves (Salbey Zu Backen)</title>
    <category>German</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup (scant) flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Cold water</li>
      <li>1 Egg, beaten</li>
      <li>A few tablespoons white wine (or hard cider)</li>
      <li>1 Egg white</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Melted butter that has been allowed to cool</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch (small) sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe is taken almost verbatim from a cookbook originally published in 1709; the language has been slightly modernized, but only 2 ingredients have been added (sugar and salt). plenty of nice fresh sage leaves oil or shortening for deep frying Take the flour and mix with the cold water into a thick batter that must be smooth. Then mix in the beaten egg and stir well; pour in a little sour wine, yet not too much. Beat the egg white into soft peaks and fold into the batter. Finally, add the butter as well as a very little salt and sugar and stir the batter once more. Wash and dry off the sage leaves, dredge them in the batter, and fry them on both sides in hot lard (see Note) until crispy. Note: I [=Horst Scharfenberg] would suggest that you fold in the egg white last of all and let the batter sit for about 30 minutes beforehand. Also, vegetable oil or shortening is recommended for deep frying rather than lard. Makes 8 servings.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Herbs *</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 large Onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 quart Water or vegetable stock</li>
      <li>1 large Potato, peeled and chopped into small cubes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Serves 4. salt and pepper bread cubes for croutons * at least 3 of these: chervil, watercress, spinach, sorrel (dandelion and pimpernel for brave souls) Bitter herbs are traditionally eaten at Easter in Christian countries as a sign of penitence. This Bavarian soup is served on Easter Thursday, known as Maundy Thursday. Fresh chervil, easily available in any German market, is usually the dominating flavor. This is a delicate fresh-tasting soup for any time of the year. You will need a large saucepan. Pick over and wash the herbs, stripping the leaves from those stalks which are too woody. Chop the rest. Melt the butter in a deep pan and fry the onion gently until transparent. Add the herbs and sweat them for a moment before you pour in the water or broth. Add the potato to the soup. Bring the soup to a boil, and then turn down the heat. Simmer for 20 minutes. Mash the potato in the soup to thicken it a little. Taste, and add salt and freshly milled pepper. Serve with bread croutons fried in butter or bacon fat (goose fat is even better). They should be so hot that they sizzle when they are added to the hot soup at the table.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Soak the beans overnight, then drain the water, rinse and add 3 1/2 cups of fresh water and the pinches of cayenne and chili powder. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, sautee the garlic, onion, peppers, cumin and another pinch of cayenne until the onions are soft. When the beans are soft, stir in the sauteed onions. Then add the squash on the top and cook until tender (about 15 minutes). Next, add the corn and cook for 10 more minutes. Finally, add the salt and mix the cassrole together. Garnish with lots of chopped parsley or scallions. Serve hot with tortillas and a salad. Makes great leftovers too! : The Native American 3 Sisters of Life Native American Indians honored their three staples - corn, beans and squash - by refering to them as the "3 Sisters of Life". These plants not only provide a balanced set of nutrients, they symbiotically nourish and protect each other when they are grown together. The beans provide nitrogen for the corn, which in turn provide poles for the beans, while the spiny squash provide protection from the racoons and deer. As a demonstration of the true partnership between the gardner and the land, Native American crops included snap and dry beans, summer and winter squash, and corn. According to Native American tradition, corn is called the Sacred Mother and revered as a gift from the gods. Corn, the all-nourishing sacred food, has been used in innumerable rituals to symbolize and honor fertility, renewal and power. The midsummer harvest was a time of joyful celebration. Natures many varieties of corn can be eaten fresh on the cob, roasted over hot coals, cooked in soups or stews, or ground for meal or flour. Beans and corn form a complimentary protein so they were often used together in cooking. The many types of beans (pinto, red kidney, soldier) were cooked in a variety of ways, most commonly boiled and fried. Most of the beans that were grown were dried and stored for future use. Both summer and winter squash were widely cultivated. Fresh and dried squash were boiled, baked, fried and cooked in stews. Native American cooks seasoned squash with nut butters or maple syrup, while colonists used butter and cinnamin or nutmeg. Here is a colorful casserole which honors the Native American "3 Sisters of Life". Enjoy!

      <li>Pressing: Split the block lengthwise. lay several layers of paper towel on a flat surface; place the tofu cut side down on the towels, put another couple of layers of paper towel on top, cover with something flat and rigid (I use a cutting board) and place a weight on top (I use a gallon jug of brandy :-) I read somewhere that baking the tofu after pressing the water out and before marinating helps the tofu to absorb the marinade better. So, I cut up the tofu after pressing, then bake at 375 deg for 15 min. Then I put the tofu in the marinade, wait awhile, then stir fry or grill. Works great for me. From: pasquale@lanl.gov (Gina Pasquale). let it sit for 45 minutes or longer; this presses out the excess water in the tofu, and makes it chewier and less likely to crumble. It can then be grilled or baked, or cut up for use in stir-fries. I usually marinate it after pressing. Here are a couple of marinades to get you started: 1) 1/2 cup light soy 1/2 cup dry sherry 2 tbs fresh grated ginger 2 cloves minced garlic 2) 1/2 cup fresh soy 1/2 cup lime juice 1 TBS ground cumin 1 TBS olive oil 2 serrano chiles, seeded and diced 3) 1 cup orange juice 3 tbs jamaican jerk sauce From: narad@nudibranch.asd.sgi.com (Chuck Narad). rfvc Digest V94 Issue #200 Sept. 17, 1994.

      <li>IT-TOOK-FORTY-YEARS-TO-GET-IT-RIGHT BOSTON BAKED BEANS Soak beans at least overnight in the 6 cups of water (longer is even better). Drain, cover with fresh water, add the bay leaves, and simmer covered until *very* tender, about two hours. Drain, place half in a bean pot or other casserole with a tight-fitting top. Add all other ingredients. Place remaining beans in pot, cover with boiling water, and bake tightly covered (use a sheet of heavy aluminum foil tightly crimped around the top if your casserole doesn't have a cover) in a 325 degree F (160 degree C) oven for about 7 hours. Remove top, pull piece of meat (if using) to top of mixture so it can brown, and bake another hour uncovered. (Note: it's a good idea to check water level after about 5 hours, and add more boiling water if necessary to keep the water level above beans until it's time to uncover.) Serve (on Saturday night, of course) with ketchup or chili sauce, and steamed brown bread. If you want to be quite traditional, reheat leftovers and serve with codfish cakes or balls for Sunday breakfast. Freezes well, so if your bean pot is large enough, do two pounds at a time and stock up. ESTHER@ROCHGTE.FIDONET.ORG (ESTHER VAIL) REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe was given to my by Judy Burtner, who was Home Extension agent for Frederic Co. Virginia many years ago. She specifically called for this being baked in cans.... This is a different tea bread, and is exceptionally good. It freezes well. Combine eggs, oil, and milk. Beat until well blended. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, and salt. Add to egg mixture, and stir until combined. Stir in the carrots, coconut, cherries, raisins, and pecans. Turn into 4 greased/floured vegetable cans (like green beans come in). Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes. Let cool in can for about 5 minutes, then cool completely. Refrigerate until ready to use. Note: a regular loaf pan may be used or 4-5 mini-loaf pans. I'll bet this would be great done in the "jar".

      <li>Source : From my mother with love &amp; more. Family recipe. Dough: In food processor with steel knife , put butter, flour, cheese. blend with the On /Off button 2 -3 time. Add while food processor is working slowly the water (not all, or maybe you should add some more) till you get a ball. stop the food processor , do not over mix. Sprey with Pam , a 10 inch Quich pan. With your hand arrange dough in pan . Prick with fork all over dough, cover with nylon seal warp and put in your refrigerator for later use. Second step: NOTE: Mushrooms: Use some like Chapignons, 2 kinds of forest mushrooms. one that grow near pine trees, and the other one theirs shape are like big ears that you do not cut , but tare them with your hands to strips. Wash and dry mushrooms. Prepare in a bowl the mushrooms, cut the chapignons not in small pieces. so the other kind, and tare the ears shape mushrooms. In a big frying pan or a whook, Heat well oil, add onions and fry till you get a nice gold colour. Transfer to a small bowl. Add the other 1 Tabls oil, Heat well , Do not lower heat . Add the mushrooms ,and toss them well till they are well blended with the oil and begin to fry.They should not get soggy. Add salt and pepper, Add the onions, mix, and stir for couple of minutes. Transfer to a bowl for later use. cool. Final step: In a bowl beat lightly eggs, Add all other ingredients, mix. Add little salt and Pepper. Arrange mushrooms on the dough . Pour over the eggs mixer, Shake pan to cover well . Bake in preheated 350 F hot oven for 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving. Freeze very good. Note: I always buy 3 kinds of cheeses. like, Sharp Cheddar Emental, and Smoked Katzkavaal.(or any other sharp cheese, I ground it all in the food processor, and put 1 cup each in a Zip Lock,and keep in my freezer, So when ever I need ground cheese I have it handy. Serve with any fresh and cooked vegetable salads. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #323 by Zvi&amp;Rina perry &lt;pzvi@netvision.net.il&gt; on</li>

    <title>24-Hour French Bread</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Water (110-degrees)</li>
      <li>7 1/2 cups Bread flour to 8 cups</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 Egg white (for glaze)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water (for glaze)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In large bowl of electric mixer, dissolve yeast in 2-1/2 c water. Add 2-1/2 to 3 c flour; stir 1 minute. Batter will have consistency of soft pudding. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, overnight or at least 8 hours. The longer the sponge ferments, the better the flavor will be. The next day, stir in salt and 1 to 1-1/2 c of remaining flour. Beat at medium speed with electric mixer 6 minutes, or beat 600 vigorous strokes by hand. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Clean and lightly flour bowl. Knead dough 15 to 20 minutes or until smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky. Place dough in floured bowl. Dust surface lightly with flour; cover with a slightly damp towel. Let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until tripled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours. Grease 2 large baking sheets or 4 French-bread pans. Punch down dough. Knead 2 minutes. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. For oblong loaves, divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces, depending on desired thickness of loaves. On a lightly floured surface, shape each piece into a smooth log, gently tapering ends. For round loaves, divide dough in half. Shape each half into a smooth ball. Place shaped dough on prepared baking sheets. Cover with a dry towel. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Adjust oven racks to 2 lowest positions. Place a shallow roasting pan on lowest shelf; pour in 2 c boiling water. Preheat oven 15 minutes to 425-degrees. Slash tops of oblong loaves with 5 diagonal slashes each. Slash tops of each round loaf with 3 horizontal slashes and 3 vertical slashes in a tic-tac-toe design. Brush loaves with cold water. Bake 15 minutes. Brush loaves with egg-white glaze; bake 10 minutes longer. Brush again with egg-white glaze. Remove roasting pan from oven. Bake loaves 10 to 15 minutes longer, for a total of 35 to 40 minutes, or until bread sounds hollow when tapped on bottom. Remove from pans; place loaves directly on oven rack. Bake 5 minutes longer. Cool on racks. Makes 2 to 4 loaves. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>1 Whole 15 Cent Balloon</li>
      <li>gallons Jug (Sterilized)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Mix juices and sugar in a large bowl so after the sugar dissolves well it will be easy to funnel into a jug. 2. Dissolve yeast in a little lukewarm water and than add to the jug. 3. Cap the jug with the balloon. (be sure you save the original cap for the jug. You will need it later.) 4. The balloon will gradually expand as the wine "works." Remove the balloon on the 21st day and it's all ready for serving. Suitable to serve with meals. Be sure to read notes. NOTES : Helpful hints: Sterilize your jugs well. Measure the yeast accurately and be sure to use lukewarm water to dissolve the yeast. Hot water will kill the action.

ORIGINAL POSTERS NOTES: *NOTE: For greater flavor with little or no fat add, substitute no fat beef broth or some wine for part of the water called for in the ingredients. **If you have a sensitivity to sodium, note that the dry onion soup mix may be high in salt. I have also posted a recipe for onion seasoning mix in CAT 3 TOPic 31 that was posted on the board sometime back that enables you to use your own mix and control the amount of salt in it.

      <li>This recipe contains no carbonation and no ice cream. I have not tried it spiked, but you could probably add rum to it (I'm not up on alcohol, but I believe that's supposed to be good in punch). This is our family's punch recipe--we serve it for all special occasions. I will give what I think are the proportions first, then I'll give the exact amounts my mother-in-law uses for the 11 people in our extended family. *Sorry, I don't know the size of the "tall can", but it's the standard U.S. size that is larger than the 12-oz.-can size. Prepare lemonade. Reconstitute orange juice, pineapple juice,and grapefruit juice, according to package directions, and in separate containers. Add lemonade to punch bowl. Add all of the orange juice, 1/2 (up to 3/4) of the pineapple juice, and 1/2 of the grapefruit juice. Slice thin orange wheels and float on top for a festive look. Cherries would also look nice.

    <title>400-Clove Garlic Turkey From the Stinking Ros</title>
    <category>Poultry</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Turkey</li>
      <li>4 ounces Butter</li>
      <li>2 ounces Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Sage, fresh; chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>2 pounds Garlic cloves; peeled</li>
      <li>2 cups Wine, white</li>
      <li>2 cups Stock, chicken</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Turkey stock may be substituted for chicken stock, if available. Clean and wash the turkey and pat dry with a paper towel. Loosen the skin of the breast and rub the turkey under the skin with the sage and chopped garlic. Season the turkey inside and out with salt and pepper and remaining sage. Place turkey in a large roasting pan, preferably on a rack. Roast the turkey at 350 degrees, basting every twenty minutes with the melted butter and olive oil combined. An hour and half before the turkey will be finished, add the 400 garlic cloves to the bottom of the roasting pan. Continue to baste the turkey and at the same time stir the cloves at the bottom of the pan. Then the turkey is done, remove it from the pan. Drain the drippings into a small sauce pan, reserving the garlic in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on a burner over medium-high heat. Add white wine and stock. Bring to a boil, stirring with a wisk to mash the roasted garlic cloves. Place the saucepan with the drippings over medium heat and with a whip add the flour to form a roux. Add the roux to the garlic gravy a little at a time until it reaches the desired thickness. Carve the turkey and serve with the 400-clove garlic gravy, accompnied by garlic mashed potatoes. This popular North Beach restaurant claims that it "seasons its garlic with food." You'll see what they mean when you look at the list of ingredients.

Add lemon juice mix with apples, pack into jars leaving a good 1/2 inch at top of jar. Seal and process jars in water bath for 20 minutes. Makes about 7 quarts of filling. After jars are completely cooled, I unscrew the ring and cut large circles of holiday-ish tissue paper, put over the lid, then gently put screw the ring back on. I then make labels on my computer with cardstock and a Christmas graphic, titled, "Pamela's Apple Pie in a Jar", punch a hole in the top, which I tie with raffia around lids that have the recipe for the crumb topping below: : 1 cup butter : 1 cup brown sugar : 1 cup flour : Process til crumbly. : Stir in: : 1 cup oatmeal Spread on top of filling in a 9x13 pan. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Top with ice cream or whipped cream while warm. Note: For my small family, I can filling in pint size jars and bake in a 8x8 pan.

      <li>1 teaspoon Honey</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Wheat bran</li>
      <li>1 cup Skim milk</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons Applesauce</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a 2 quart measuring bowl or other utensil that will pour easily, mix flour, bran, salt and spice; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine yeast, water, and honey, and let rest 5 minutes while peeling, coring, and grating apple. Add grated apples, applesauce, milk, and egg whites to yeast mixture; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Pour about 1 cup of batter into a hot waffle iron* and cook for 7 ~ 8 minutes, or until the lid lifts easily. Pancakes: Pour about 1/2 cup of batter onto a medium-hot, nonstick griddle and flatten cakes so the enter will cook. Cook about 10 minutes on first side, about 6 - 8 minutes on the other side. Don't turn until bubbles form on top. These cakes are thicker than regular pancakes and take longer to cook. NOTES : * Lightly oil a nonstick waffle iron before heating to prevent sticking. To keep warm before serving, place cooked waffles in a warm oven on a bare oven rack.

      <li>Mix the pancake mix, milk, egg and oil in a 2 cup measure. OK to have a little rough mixture. Make the mixture a little thinner than regular batter but thicker than for a crepe. Heat an 8" shallow Teflon (sloped sided) pan with a drop of oil on medium heat. Pour in 1/4 of the batter (enough to make a thin pancake. Allow the dough to cook until the bubbles form on top but the pk is not cooked all the way through. The bottom should be a light golden brown. Scoop 3 Tbs of apple sauce on one half of the pancake. Quickly fold the other half over so it puffs up. Cook for about a minute or so (being careful not to burn). Turn over briefly to cook other side and warm the apples. Serve each on a large platter and top with cinnamon and sliced strawberries Finish with a little powdered sugar. I think what happened was that the applesauce mixed with the still uncooked pancake top and was cooked (combined) to make an unusual fluffy inside. * Use one Tb of oil to cut fat. ...George From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>You can make a 2-crust pie by doubling the crust recipe I put up there, or you can make a crumb topping by mixing 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1 cup flour with a pastry cutter until it's crumbly. For that pie, bake it at 400 degrees for 40-50 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned but the topping isn't burned. (Check frequently after 35 minutes) Filling's easy. Peel, core and slice about 7 apples, enough to make 6-7 cups. Mix with 1 Tbsp of lemon juice. In another bowl, mix together 1/4 cup flour, 3/4 cups granulated sugar, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Pour it over the apples and mix well. I like to do this before preparing the crust so that it gets a bit liquid and better distributed over the apples. Anyway, you fill the pie, top with either pastry or streusel, and bake - 45-55 minutes at 425 degrees for a pastry-topped pie, and don't forget to pierce the top crust in several places. If you want something different, you can also add 3/4 to 1 cup of either cranberries or raisins to the apples, too. Another thing - don't forget to lay out foil either on the bottom of the oven or on the rack below the pie to save cleanup. * From the Polka Dot Cottage, 1-201-822-3627, NJ's BBS for Homemakers!

To make pie, make crust and bake. Into prepared crust, put thawed filling and bake until warmed through. Crumb topping can be added before baking filling if you want (I use sugar, cinnamon, margarine and chopped pecans.) I found that the thickener (the flour, water, etc. mix that is cooked first) made a lot more than could be used up by 24 c of apples. I think I got a total of 8-10 large containers (I use empty 32 oz yogurt containers). One of these containers was just enough for a 9 in pie. I also used (don't tell anybody) prepared pie shells just fine with this filling.

      <li>1 1/4 cups Cheddar; Md, Shredded</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>

      <li>1 Egg Yolk; Lg, Beaten</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Use tart cooking apples such as Macs or Granny Smith's. Core, pare and thinly slice the apples. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ CHEDDAR CRUST: Combine the flour, cheese and salt in a bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the shortening until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle the iced water (5 or 6 tbls will be needed) and using a fork, toss the crumbs until a dough is formed. Press the dough firmly into a ball. FILLING: Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the larger half, on a lightly floured surface, to a 13-inch circle. Line a 9-inch pie plate with the pastry, trimming the edges to 1/2-inch beyond the rim of the pie plate. (Note: When lining the pie plate, be careful not to stretch the pastry when spreading it out. This will cause holes or the pastry will shrink and the filling will run over in the oven as it is baked. Place in the pie plate and gently, working from the center, spread the pastry out until it covers the bottom of the pie plate and then lay the rest of the pastry over the rim and trim.) Combine the apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl, mixing well. Arrange the apple mixture in the pastry lined pie plate. Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle. Gently fold into quarters and cut steam slits in the folds. Unfold the crust and place on top of the filling, trimming the crust to 1-inch beyond the rim of the pie plate. Fold the top crust under the lower one and flute to form a ridge around the edge of the pie plate. Combine the egg yolk and water, then brush the mixture over the top crust and rim. Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until apples are tender and the crust is a golden brown. Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm and serve with Vanilla Ice Cream, if desired.

      <li>5 tablespoons Ice water; up to 7 Tablespoons</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>6 cups Tart baking apples; Rome or Jonathan, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Apple cider</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Anise seeds; ground</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>For the crust, combine the flour with the sugar and salt in a food processor. Scatter the cheese over the flour. Cut the butter, lard and shortening into small pieces, and add them. Process briefly, until a crumbly meal forms. (Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a bowl with a pastry blender.) Pour in the smaller amount of water, and process or blend until the dough holds together, adding the extra water if needed. Divide the dough into two balls. Wrap these in plastic, and refrigerate them for at least 30 minutes and as long as 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the apples with the smaller amount of brown sugar, adding the rest if they taste overly tart. Mix in the remaining ingredients. Roll out both balls of refrigerated dough on a floured surface. Place one in the bottom of whichever size pie pan you=re using, add the filling, and top with the second crust. Crimp the edges and prick a few holes in the top to allow the steam to escape. Bake the pie for 50 to 55 minutes, until the crust seems well set and lightly browned. Check it after 25 to 30 minutes, covering the edges with foil if they appear to be browning too rapidly. Serve the pie warm or at room temperature.

      <li>Combine all ingredients and place in a tight jar or tin. Shake every few days. Cinnamon oil has an extremely strong scent that intensifies as it is absorbed. Add additional oil if needed. The red sumac berries that grow wild can be used dried as a stablizer for potpourri (in other recipes it takes the place of orris root which is very expensive). I used sumac berries instead of nandina berries in this recipe. busted by sooz Recipe by: Key Gourmet Posted to recipelu-digest by sooz &lt;kirkland@gj.net&gt; on Mar 20, 1998</li>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Combine the apple slices, apple juice and cinnamon in a large saucepan. Leave the saucepan uncovered. Simmer over low heat until most of the liquid is absorbed into the apples, stirring occasionally. The apples will be ready after about 30 minutes. Cool slightly. Combine the white and whole wheat flours and salt in a bowl. Combine 1/3 of the mixture with enough of the apple juice to form a paste. Cut the butter into the remaining flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Stir in the paste. Form a soft dough but do not knead. Roll out half the dough and fit into the (9") Pie Plate. Fill with the cooked apples. Roll out the remaining dough and form a top crust. Place the top crust over the filling and press the edges together with a fork. Prick a few vents in the top crust. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees. Bake until golden brown (15-20 minutes). Serve warm, at room temperature or cold. Excellent with sharp cheddar or vanilla ice cream.

Sprinkle lemon juice over them. Drain the raspberries and reserve the juice or another use. Sprinkle the beries over the apples. Mix flour and sugar in a bowl. Cut the butter in with your fingers until mixture is crumbly. Add nutmeg and cover the fruit with this mixture. Bake for 25 minutes or until top is golden brown. Serve with heavy cream, softly whipped if you wish. (I've done whipped cream in a pressurized can on this and it's good too). I believe this came from her Quick Cook book.

      <li>4 Apples; thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups Apple juice</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Raisins</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon; optional</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Kuzu</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CRUST (FOR 8-INCH PIE</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Whole wheat pastry flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Corn oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Barley malt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Sea salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Prepare crust first by mixing salt into the fresh pastry flour, then adding oil until flour begins to bead. Sprinkle barley malt over this mixture, slightly mix, and add enough water to make a thick ball of dough. Quickly roll out between two sheets of wax paper or on a board used for pie crusts. Cut into a circle which is about 9-inches wide and place into lightly oiled glass or stainless steel pie pan. Pierce the bottom of the pie crust and sides lightly with a fork so the crust will not puff up and let the liquid from the pie filling go under it. Meanwhile, combine apples, 1/3 cup of apple juice and raisins and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. Mix in cinnamon and lemon juice. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Combine kuzu and remaining 1 cup of apple juice, stir until dissolved, and bring to a boil. Simmer about 1 minute or until transparent and thickened. Spoon apples into crust and pour glaze over. Bake for about 40 minutes. ]] Formatted by suechef@sover.net NOTES : Pies originated in England as meat pies.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie</li>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds Tart apples; firm</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Brown sugar; firmly packed, depending on the tartness of the apples</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Unsalted butter; cut into small piece</li>
      <li>Milk; cream or 1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400F. Roll out half the pastry on a floured board and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edge and chill well. Peel, quarter, core, and slice the apples. Toss them in a large bowl with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and spices and toss again. Pile the apples into the pie shell, dot the top with butter, and wet the pastry lip. Roll out the other half of the pastry, carefully fit it over the pie, and trim the edge, allowing a half-inch overhang. Tuck the extra pastry under the lower lip and crimp it to seal the crust. Cut vents into the top crust. Decorate the top of the pie with extra pastry cutouts or whatever design you may choose, plain or fancy. Brush the surface with a little milk or cream or with an egg thinned with water. Bake the pie for 20 minutes, then lower the heat to 35OF and bake until the crust is golden brown and the apples are tender, 20 to 30 minutes longer. If the edge of the crust browns too much, cover it with aluminum foil. Serve the pie warm or at room temperature with a slice of cheddar cheese, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, or a dollop of whipped cream. NOTES : This American standard has countless variations. To name a few, add chopped nuts or cranberries to the filling; substitute whiskey for the lemon juice; add more apples and use a top crust only for a deep-dish pie.

      <li>3 tablespoons Cold water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel and core apples and slice paper-thin (the thinness of the apples is important as they barely cook). Add the rum or lemon juice and sugar. Mix well and let stand until ready to use. Beat eggs with the sugar and cold water, then add the apple mixture. Cook according to directions, fold and serve. To flame the omelette, sprinkle top with 2 tablespoons of sugar and pour 3-4 tablespoons of hot rum over it. Set the rum afire and keep pouring it over the flaming omelette until the fire dies out. NOTES : The apples may be replaced by peaches, pears or other seasonal Ontario fruits and prepared in the same manner. The recipe is easily doubled.

      <li>We are talking about favorite recipes... so I decided to post one of our favorites. This algo goes for someone (I don't remember who) who asked for a r-e-a-l-l-y crunchy topping for a fruit pie posted some days ago. This came from my favorite cookbook "Cafe Beaujolais", by Margaret Fox and John Bear, Ten Speed Press. BTW, wouldn't you be interested in sharing the names of your favorite cookbooks? Mix together apples, lemon juice, lemon rind, and water (or the other liquid you chose). Place in a buttered 9-inch round cake pan. Using an eletric mixer at slow speed, blend sugar, butter, flour, oats, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, until crumbly. Scatter evenly on top of apples. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Serve warm. Optional toppings: vanilla ice-cream, whipped cream or Vanilla custard sauce. EAT-L DIGEST 18 JUNE 1996 From the EAT-L recipe list.

      <li>Recipe by: McDougall Mix flour and bran. Add applesauce and mix well. Add yeast to warm water, stir to dissolve. Let rest 5 minutes while grating the apple. Add the apple juice, grated apple, and yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Stir batter well. Mix the egg replacer with water, beat until frothy. Add to batter. Cover batter and let rest for 15 minutes. Cook on medium-hot non-stick griddle, about 10 minutes on first side, about 5-8 minutes on other side. HELPFUL HINTS: Ladle the batter on the griddle and flatten cakes, or the center won't be done. Do not turn until bubbles form on top. These are much thicker than regular pancakes and take longer to cook.

In hot &amp; humid weather, use 1/8 c less water. This barely sweet, fruity rye tastes good with scrambled eggs or in a turkey sandwich. For tea sandwiches, slice thin and spread with cream cheese and toasted sliced almonds. Tested in DAK R2D2.

      <li>6 tablespoons Butter, unsalted, or more</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>4 large Apples, baking (Rome other not-too-tart variety) peeled, cored, quarters cut cross-wise into 1/4-inch slices</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Molasses</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F. Butter six 8-ounce ramekins or souffle dishes. (Ramekins are round cup-cake-like porcelain cups &lt;only a bit larger&gt; that are used to bake souffles, and such.) Use a cutter to cut slices of bread into 12 rounds that fit into the dishes you've chosen to use. Spread the rounds with softened butter on both sides, and sprinkle 1 side of each round with a little sugar. Place 1 bread round in each dish, sugared side down. Reserve 6 of the rounds for tops. Toss your sliced apples with molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, rum, lemon juice, vanilla and pieces of butter until well coated. Spoon the apple mixture into the ramekins filling them nearly full and spooning some of the juices over the top. Top each dish with a reserved bread round, sugared side up. Place the ramekins in a roasting pan and then place the pan on the center rack of the oven. Pour an inch of hot water into the roasting pan around the ramekins. Bake until the bread tops are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve warm in ramekins with whipped cream on the side.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Eat More, Weigh Less Combine the flour, egg substitute, 1 cup yogurt, baking powder, orange juice, and 2 tablespoons maple syrup into a batter. If you like thinner pancakes, add 2 to 4 tablespoons of water at this point. Let rest for 1/2 hour. Meanwhile, in a nonstick skillet, saute the sliced apples with 1 tablespoon water until the slices are tender and caramelized. Combine the remaining yogurt and maple syrup with the cinnamon. Using a nonstick omelette pan, make thin crepes by pouring 3 tablespoons of the batter into the preheated pan and rolling it around to uniformly cover the surface of the pan. Cook over medium heat about 1 minute, flip with a spatula and cook the other side for about 10 seconds. Continue until all the batter has been used. For each serving, roll each of two crepes around 2 tablespoons of the apples. Garnish with a dollop of flavored yogurt and a mint leaf. 278 calories, 1.2 grams fat per 3 (4- to 5-inch) pancakes with filling.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>6 cups Peeled; cored, and thinly sliced apples (about 7 apples)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/2 cups White or brown sugar; firmly packed</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Rolled old-fashioned oats</li>
      <li>1/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Butter; cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped nuts; lightly toasted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter a shallow 8-cup ovenproof pan. In a large bowl toss the apple slices with the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Spread the slices in the buttered pan. In the same bowl mix the remaining sugar, oats, flour, and cinnamon. With your fingertips rub the butter into the dry ingredients until it sticks together in crumbles, then mix in the nuts. Scatter the topping over the apple slices. Put the pan in the oven and bake until the topping is brown and crisp and the apples tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. NOTES : The oatmeal in this version of an old favorite gives crunch; add nuts or not, as you like. Use peaches, pears, plums, or another fruit.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>First make the cinnamon butter. Beat all the ingredients together until the mixture is smooth. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator until serving. (This keeps for 7-10 days.) Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar and cinnamon into a bowl. Beat in the melted butter, beaten eggs and milk. Grate the apples into the mixture and mix in well. Oil a griddle, or a heavy-basedfrylng pan, or an electric hotplate, or if you have an Aga or Rayburn, the cooler hotplate. (For my American readers an Aga is a constantly burning range-like cooker with two or four ovens and hotplates. It gives an even heat and very consistent results.) Drop spoonsful of the apple batter on to the oiled surface, making pancakes of 2-3 inches / 5-7-5cm in diameter and leaving a space between them. Cook for about 2 minutes or until small bubbles appear over the surface, then, with a palette knife (pancake turner), slip each over to cook on the other side. As they cook, remove the pancakes and keep them warm on a plate, and covered with a cloth. When all the pancakes are cooked, serve them hot with the cinnamon butter.

Cut vents so steam can escape. Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. Serve hot cutting squares of biscuit as a base for the fruit mixture. Serve with whipped cream sprinkled with nutmeg. Instead of rolling out the dough, drop it from a spoon over the filling. This allows the gooey sauce to bubble up around the dough.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>And now, for the second half - Apple Pan Dowdy. This recipe is from a book of Early American recipes that my mom gave me years and years ago. I have another called "A World Of Good Eating," that is equally as interesting and as old. I don't know the exact title of the book cause the front page is gone. I think the books were published in 1951, but am not sure. I also think both books were written and/or complied by Heloise Frost (of Heloise's Helpful Household Hints, maybe?) Mix sugar and spices together-add molasses and water. Arrange apples in a large baking dish and pour the mixture of molasses, etc., over them. Dot with butter and voer with pastry. Bake in hot oven (425) for about 30 minutes. Then cut into the crust with a knife and return to moderate over (350) for at least 1 hour more. Serve with cream or ice cream.

      <li>I have not made these yet--but glad to find a fatfree muffin recipe. This is from Dr. Andrew Weil's latest book and the recipe is also posted at his web site. Heat oven to 325° F. Lightly oil muffin tin. Peel and core apples and chop coarsely. Set aside. In a separate bowl, sift together pastry flour, white flour, oat bran, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add thawed apple-juice concentrate, chopped apples, and enough water to make a light batter. Mix just enough to moisten all ingredients. Divide batter among the muffin cups (makes 12) and bake till lightly browned, 25-30 minutes. Remove muffins from cups while hot.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a pie plate with one pastry. Cut to fit and poke holes with a fork. Mix sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and flour in a small bowl. Toss apples with lemon juice. Add flour mixture to apples and toss to coat. Put in pie plate and dot top with butter. Cover with second pastry, seal and crimp edges, and cut slits in center. Bake about 50-60 minutes, until crust is lightly browned. (You may want to cover outside edge with foil to prevent burning. Also, a baking sheet or double thickness of foil on the rack beneath the pie will save cleanup time.) For French Apple Pie, use a single crust and top pie with 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, and 1 cup flour mixed together until crumbly, reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees, and bake 45-55 minutes.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dry yeast</li>
      <li>5 cups Bread mix; up to six lukewarm water</li>
      <li>2 Eggs; beaten</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: TOPPING</li>
      <li>1 Egg; beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Coarse salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Blend in 2 eggs and butter. Add 5 cups bread mix. Stir well. Add additional bread mix to make a soft, but not too sticky dough. Knead about 5 minutes until dough is smooth. Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 to 24 inches long. Form into pretzel shapes. For pretzel sticks, cut dough into 5 to 6 inch lengths. Place on prepared baking sheets. Preheat oven to 425. Brush tops of pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake immediately 12 to 15 minutes, until brown and crisp. Makes 12 to 15 large pretzels. Variation For a chewier pretzel, drop pretzel-shaped dough into a pan of boiling water. When dough floats to the top of the water, remove it. Preheat oven to 400. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake about 30 minutes. All of these recipes I have posted using my bread mix can be adjusted to use with the bread machine, some using the dough setting. I have had excellent results. Will try to post more over the weekend as I get time. Also have a lot of other "mix" recipes if anyone is interested.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Translated Meurbeteig means " mellow dough ." The basic method for this versatile dough which can be made into many variations starts with the principle of : one part weight sugar, double weight butter and triple weight flour.The cup amounts above are approximates. Just weigh ingredients for the most accurate measurements. Combine the flour, butter and sugar and stir in enough egg yolk with vanilla, wine, and lemon to taste to bind the dough. The dough can be made batter like, softer or firmer as desired. this is the outstanding feature of this dough to change it to your liking. For kuchens the dough can be made into a texture to spread or pat into the pan. although normally no baking powder is used, a teaspoon made be added for kuchen type doughs.Normally the dough is like a short dough similar to tart pastry.Basically for softer doughs, increase the egg yolks and decrease the flour. for chocolate variations add some baking cocoa or melted chocolate. For a tangy dough add some sour cream, or grated cheese for a cheese pastry dough. blend in almonds for a nut dough. Of importance is that the dough should be prepared quickly and chilled prior to using if used for tart shells or pastries.Then it can be rolled out to fit tart pans etc.Prick the dough with tines of a fork when used for tart pastries. For kuchens the dough need not be chilled and may be used immediately. Double recipe if desired.Follow individual recipes, baking temperature usually from 350 to 375.Dough freezes well.

Asking if they might have the recipe, they were told to leave their name and their address and it would be mailed to them. On their return, they found the recipe with a bill for $200.00. Aghast, they consulted their lawyer and were told that inasmuch as they had ordered with- out asking the price, they would have to pay. Feeling that so costly a recipe should be shared with many, Mrs. Robbins had copies made and sent to her friends. Try it and we think you'll smack your lips. 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons dry mustard 2 teaspoons paprika 2 teaspoons celery seed or ground celery seed 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup vinegar 2 cups Mazola oil 2 tablespoons grated onions Put together in the top of a double boiler and stir well.

      <li>16 Slices of Italian bread,</li>
      <li>Cut 1/2-inch thick</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Black or green olivada* OR</li>

      <li>Slices</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Brush one side of the bread slices with some of the olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet oiled side up. Bake until lightly browned and crusty, about 4 minutes. 2. Spread the olivada or chopped olives on each toast, cover each with a slice of mozzarella and top with a slice of tomato. Brush the tomatoes with the remaining oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Bake until the cheese is melted, about 8 to 10 minutes. Serve at once. * Olivada is a puree of black or green olives packed in oil that is sold at specialty food stores. You can substitute tapenade or make your own. (Note from me: We have a batch of pesto in the refrigerator so I plan to use it instead of the olivada.) I also plan to use Creole or homegrown tomatoes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Incredibly simple when made in a breadmaker, this recipe yields one 12-inch (or if you have a larger machine, a 15-inch) pizza crust. Fit the kneading blade firmly on the shaft in the bread pan. Carefully measure the flours, salt, and the sugar, and transfer to the pan. Add the water, oil, and yeast. Place the bread pan inside the machine and close the lid. Program the breadmaker for the whole wheat dough mode. At the end of the rising cycle, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Lightly oil a 12-inch (or 15-inch) pizza pan and sprinkle with the cornmeal. With floured hands, gently stretch the dough into a 12-inch (or 15-inch) circle and place in the prepared pan. Continue stretching until the dough covers the entire surface if the pan. Push the dough against the rim of the pan to make an edge, then top the dough with your choice of pizza fillings. Bake the pizza on the bottom rack of a preheated 400ºF oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until the crust is golden and the filling is melted and bubbly. Serve hot.

      <li>From: jewish-food Date: Wednesday, June 26, 1996 10:35AM I feel it is my personal responsibility to let everyone in the world know about my 10-minute lasagna. It requires no boiling of noodles and you can cook it in a fleishig oven because the pan is tightly sealed ( at least according to my understanding). In an aluminum lasagna tin, layer as follows: 2 layers of lasagna noodles sauce cottage cheese sauce 1 layer of lasagna noodles American cheese sauce rest of lasagna noodles sauce Pour 2 cups of water over the whole thing. Courage! It will look terrible. Put a sheet of tin foil over it and tightly seal it. Bake in a 425 degree oven for about 1 hour. Let it rest before cutting it so it will not fall apart. That's it. You may make any additions you wish. I have added vegetables and different seasonings according to my mood and what I find in the pantry, but it is very acceptable to children plain.

      <li>Date: Fri, 23 Feb 96 7:49:28 EST submitted by: LIR119@delphi.com The all purpose European pastry dough! Translated Meurbeteig means "mellow dough." The basic method for this versile dough which can be made into many variations starts with the principle of: one part weight sugar, double weight butter and triple weight flour. The cup amounts above are approximates. Just weigh ingredeints for the most accurate measurements. Combine the flour, butter and sugar and stir in enough egg yolk with vanilla, wine, and lemon to taste to bind the dough. The dough can be made batter like, softer or firmer as desired. this is the outstanding feature of this dough to change it to your liking. For kuchens the dough can be made into a texture to spread or pat into the pan, although normally no baking powder is used, a teaspoon made be added for kuchen type doughs. Normally the dough is like a short dough similar to tart pastry.Basically for softer doughs, increase the egg yolks and decrease the flour. for chocolate variations add some baking cocoa or melted choclate. For a tangy dough add some sour cream, or grated cheese for a cheese pastry dough. blend in almonds for a nut dough. Of importance is that the dough should be prepared quickly and chilled prior to using if used for tart shells or pastries. Then it can be rolled out to fit tart pans etc. Prick the dough with tines of a fork when used for tart pastires. For kuchens the dough need not be chilled and may be used immediately. Double recipe if desired.Follow individual recipes, baking temperature usually from 350 to 375. Dough freezes well.

      <li>"The Complete Book of Bread Machine Baking", edited by Lara Pizzorno I don't know where they get the title since this is not 100% WW. However, I have been told that this is the best bread that I have made so far by two different sources. The crust has a nice crunch and the bread is light with a delicious flavor. This book emphasizes healthy breads, that is why they suggest canola instead of vegetable oil, unbleached flour instead of all purpose flour, and why they add wheat germ. I don't doubt that you can easily substitute. "Therese Klodnicki" &lt;Terry_Klodnicki@msn.com&gt; From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe</li>

      <li>3 3/4 cups Wheat bread flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dry milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Source: Electric Bread The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a lighter loaf. When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset the machine and start again - or use the whole wheat cycle, if it's available on your machine. Success Hints ------------- If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food store. Remember the extra knead (as usual for wheat bread) - it's especially important for 100% whole wheat bread! You should use only the regular bake cycle.

      <li>We recently invited firehouse cooks to send in their favorite recipes. We ran a contest and the results can be seen in this recipe and the "19-Alarm Chili" recipe. The most frequently submitted dish was chili. That makes great sense since firehouse cooks often have to stop cooking right in the middle of the preparation of the dish and then come back to it later. The dish needs to stand up to this kind of treatment. Chili can take it. We have chosen two of the most interesting chili dishes and offer them to you without any explanation. While chili didn't win the contest, we certainly did gain some insight into the meaning of chili. SERVES 10-12 Robert Vazquez, of Engine Company 212 in Brooklyn, New York, sent in a recipe that caught the eyes of all of us. He offered strange additions that made me think this man is a serious cook; additions such as saffron and shallots. You would not think that these subtle and expensive ingredients would come through, but they do. This is a delicious dish ! I should also tell you that Bob's motto is "You light 'em, we fight 'em!" He is referring to chili? In a large, heavy skillet, brown ground meat and sausage. Transfer to a 4-quart pot. In the same skillet add beef stock and bring to a boil. Remove stock from heat. Crumble saffron and add to the stock. Set this aside in a separate bowl. Add olive oil to the skillet and cook the shallots and garlic for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat. Add canned chiles, oregano, cumin seeds, cayenne pepper, chili powder, salt, and a few grindings of black pepper. Stir together, then add tomato paste and beef stock. Mix together thoroughly. Add this to the meat and bring to a boil. Stir. Reduce heat and simmer in half-covered pot for 1-1/2 hours. Add beans 10 minutes before completion. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

Add tomatoes, breaking up with fork. Add chicken stock and bay leaf; bring to boil. Add beans; reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes or until slightly thickened. Discard bay leaf. [Can be prepared to this point, cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day. Or freeze for up to 1 week; thaw in refrigerator for up to 36 hours. Add 45 minutes to 1 hour to baking time.] Topping: In saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic; cook for about 2 minutes or until softened. Stir in bread crumbs and chopped parsley; sprinkle over cassoulet. Bake in 350F 180C oven for about 30 minutes or until crusty and golden on top, bubbly and heated through. 6 servings for $13.20CDN [Nov 95] Per Serving: about 440 calories, 20 g protein, 18 g fat, 51 g carbohydrate, very high source fibre, excellent source iron Source: Canadian Living magazine, Nov 95 Presented in article "Hearty &amp; Healthy: Casseroles See The Light" Recipe by Canadian Living Test Kitchen [-=PAM=-] PA_Meadows@msn.com From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons Dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Warm water (105F-115F)</li>
      <li>2 3/4 cups Whole-wheat flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Nonfat dry milk powder</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large Egg; -=OR=-</li>
      <li>2 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with dough hook, put flour, milk powder, oil and egg or egg whites into bowl. Turn machine on and combine mixture. With machine running, slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If dough is too sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon, working it in before adding more. If dough is crumbly and dry, add more water by the teaspoon, working it in before adding more. Once desired consistency is reached (moist but not sticky), mix dough until well kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in food processor, about 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put ingredients in large bowl. Mix well. Make well in center, pour in yeast mixture and work into ingredients, then knead on floured board until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in bowl. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Oil a baking sheet. Punch dough down and shape into smooth ball. Place smooth side up on baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 40-50 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F. Fifteen minutes before baking, put rack in center of oven; dust dough top lightly with flour. Make a decorative slash across the top. Bake until bread is well browned and sounds hollow when rapped on bottom, about 30-35 minutes. Immediately remove from pan and cool on rack.

      <li>Source: Electric Bread The seeds inject a crunchy, chewy texture so satisfying, you won't even need a toaster for crispness. High in fiber and high in taste, this bread brings a new dimension to an avocado and sprout sandwich. Success Hints ------------- * Experiment with unsalted seeds for different taste and texture; try equal amounts of pumpkin seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds. For best results, use the "extra knead" process and add seeds near the end of the first knead. Gluten is available in health food stores &amp; nutritional departments. Use regular, rapid bake or timed bake cycle. Posted by Dan Klepach to the Fidonet COOKING echo Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #299 Date: Fri, 1 Nov 1996 14:46:14 -0500 From: BobbieB1@aol.com</li>

Here's what I made tonight: mix all of the above (actually, use only the syrup from the pineapple) and then heat in a saucepan until it thickens. Add water if you need more sauce. Then add whatever veggies you want: Pineapple, carrots, onions, peppers, celery. Let them soften (especially the carrots: add them first). Add chicken.

Non-nutritive sweeteners may be added. If aspartame (a low-calorie nutritive sweetener) is used, the sweetening power of aspartame may be lost within 3 to 4 weeks. Yield: 5 to 6 half-pints Procedure: Thoroughly wash 4 to 6 pounds of firm, ripe peaches. Drain well. Peel and remove pits. Grind fruit flesh with a medium or coarse blade, or crush with a fork (do not use a blender). Place ground or crushed fruit in a 2-quart saucepan. Heat slowly to release juice, stirring constantly, until fruit is tender. Place cooked fruit in a jelly bag or strainer lined with four layers of cheesecloth. Allow juice to drip about 15 minutes. Save the juice for jelly or other uses. Measure 4 cups of drained fruit pulp for making spread. Combine the 4 cups of pulp, pineapple, and lemon juice in a 4-quart saucepan. Add up to 2 cups of sugar, if desired, and mix well. Heat and boil gently for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring enough to prevent sticking. Fill jars quickly, leaving 1/4-inch headspace.

      <li>"The Complete Book of Bread Machine Baking", edited by Lara Pizzorno I don't know where they get the title since this is not 100% WW. However, I have been told that this is the best bread that I have made so far by two different sources. The crust has a nice crunch and the bread is light with a delicious flavor. This book emphasizes healthy breads, that is why they suggest canola instead of vegetable oil, unbleached flour instead of all purpose flour, and why they add wheat germ. I don't doubt that you can easily substitute. "Therese Klodnicki" &lt;Terry_Klodnicki@msn.com&gt; Posted to recipelu-digest by "Christopher E. Eaves" &lt;cea260@airmail.net&gt; on Mar 04, 1998</li>

    <title>(Injera) Ethiopian Flat Bread</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>15 -20</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 cups Self-rising flour; (750 ml)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Whole wheat flour; (125 ml)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Teff flour; (from African grocery or health food store)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cornmeal or masa harina; (125 ml)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Active dry yeast; (one package) (15 ml)</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Warm water; (875 ml)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>15-20 12-inch Injera In a large bowl, mix: Let set in large bowl, covered, an hour or longer, until batter rises and becomes stretchy. It can sit as long as 3-6 hours. When ready, stir batter if liquid has settled on bottom. Whip in blender, 2 cups of batter at a time, thinning it with 1/2 - 3/4 cup water. Batter will be quite thin. Cook in non-stick frypan WITHOUT OIL over medium or medium-high heat. Use 1/2 cup batter per injera for a 12-inch pan or 1/3 cup batter for a 10-inch pan. Pour batter in heated pan and quickly swirl pan to spread batter as thin as possible. Batter should be no thicker than 1/8-inch. Do not turn over. Injera does not easily stick or burn. It is cooked through when bubbles appear all over the top. Finished injera will be thicker than a crepe, but thinner than a pancake. Lay each injera on a clean towel for a minute or two, then stack in covered dish to keep warm. To serve, overlap a few injera on a platter and place stews on top ( most kinds of spicy bean or veggie stews/curries would be great with this. For Ethiopian food, the spicier the better). Or lay one injera on each dinner plate, and ladle stew servings on top. Give each person three or more injera, rolled up or folded in quarters, to use for scooping up the stews. If you make 15 12-inch injeras, each would be about 120 calories, 3% CFF. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #287 by Sandy Laken &lt;globlcit@erols.com&gt; on Dec 06, 1997</li>

      <li>Date: Thu, 21 Mar 1996 14:22:39 -0500 From: Dotnapier@aol.com This is pretty heavy bread, but I like it that way. For a better raise, try adding 1/3 cup of gluten, and you may need a bit more water, then. Use Whole Wheat mode. Timer ok. Note: Whole wheat varies greatly in how much water it absorbs. The amounts of water shown are the ones that work for me. Check on the dough after the first few minutes of kneading. If it is too thin, add flour, 1 T at the time. If the dough is too dry and does not form a smooth ball, add water, 1 T at the time. Since bread machines can handle relatively moist do, it is better to err on the moist side (which will result in heavier bread, if it is much too much). From: vmh@intellicorp.com (Valerie).

(Drink the remainder, according to Annie). Add water JUST TO COVER TOP. Cook about 3 hours on low heat. Stir often. Remove bay leaves. Couple of notes: Better the 2nd day, if you can wait that long. Also, those I substitute pure New Mexico ground red chili. Whatever you use make sure it's pure chili powder, no additional seasonings added.

      <li>This is pretty heavy bread, but I like it that way. For a better raise, try adding 1/3 cup of gluten, and you may need a bit more water, then. Use Whole Wheat mode. Timer ok. Note: Whole wheat varies greatly in how much water it absorbs. The amounts of water shown are the ones that work for me. Check on the dough after the first few minutes of kneading. If it is too thin, add flour, 1 T at the time. If the dough is too dry and does not form a smooth ball, add water, 1 T at the time. Since bread machines can handle relatively moist do, it is better to err on the moist side (which will result in heavier bread, if it is much too much). From: vmh@intellicorp.com (Valerie).

      <li>1. Rinse and dry chile. Prick chile with the tines of a fork to allow for release of steam. 2. Place chile on a cookie sheet 4-6 inches below the broiling element. Turn chile frequently until it is uniformly blistered. 3. Remove chile from the broiler and cover with a damp towel for 10 minutes. 4. Proceed with one of the steps below: a) When cooled -- package chiles in a freezer-weight container, seal - -- and freeze for later use. b) Remove the outer skin and freeze as in step A. c) Remove outer skin -- stem, and seeds.Chop and use in any recipe. d) Remove outer skin and leave chile whole -- drying, for freezing or use in a recipe. © 1994 Public Service Company of New Mexico.

      <li>James Beard's 1-2-3-4 Layer Cake; Uses three 9x1/2 inch deep cake pans. Makes: One 3-layered cake; Serves 12 depending on thickness of slices. *Note:1. If you can't find cake flour, the same amount of All-purpose flour can be substituted. * Directions * Preheat the oven to 350dF. Using your hands, butter the bottom and sides of all 3 layer-cake pans with softened butter; sprinkle flour inside, then shake pans so you get a thin coating on the butter. Tip out any excess! Now to sift your flour. Lay a large piece of waxed paper on a board, put a dry measuring cup in the center, hold a sifter directly over it, scoop cake flour from the package into the sifter, and sift the flour directly into the cup. When the cup is full, draw the back of a knife blade lightly across the top of the cup (don't shake the flour down, or it will become dense) and then tip the measured flour into a mixing bowl. Repeat with the other 2 cups of flour (you can put any flour that spilled onto the waxed paper back in the sifter). When you have 3 cups of sifted flour in the bowl, put the baking powder and salt in the sifter, holding it over the mixing bowl, and sift it over the flour. Then, still using your hands, mix the baking powder and salt lightly with the flour. Next, put the butter into a second, large mixing bowl. If it is very firm (it shouldn't be, if you have left it out of the fridge), squeeze it through your fingers until it softens up. When it is soft enough to work, form your right hand into a big fork, as it were, and cream the butter. This means that you beat it firmly and quickly with your hand, beating and aerating it, until it becomes light, creamy and fluffy. Then whirl your fingers around like a whisk so the butter forms a circle in the bowl. Gradually cream the 2 cups of sugar into the butter with the same fork-like motion, beating until the mixture is very light and fluffy. As the sugar blends in it will change the color of the butter to a much lighter color, almost white. Now wash and dry your hands thoroughly. Separate the eggs as you would for a souffle', letting the whites slip though slightly parted fingers into a small bowl and dropping the yokes into a second, larger bowl. Beat the yokes for a few minutes with a whisk until they are well blended. Then, again with your hand, beat them very thoroughly into the butter-sugar mixture. Now beat in the milk alternately with the sifted flour -- first one, then the other -- this time keeping your fingers close together as if your hand were a wooden spatula. Beat, beat, beat until the batter is well mixed, then add the vanilla and beat that in for 1 or 2 minutes. Put the egg whites in your beating bowl and beat them with a large whisk or and electric hand beater until they mount first to soft, drooping peaks and then to firm, glossy peaks. Do not over beat so that they are stiff and dry! Tip the beaten whites onto the cake batter and fold them in with your hand. Slightly cup your hand and use the side like a spatula to cut down through the whites and batter to the bottom of the bowl and then flop them over with your cupped hand, rotating the bowl with your other hand as you do so ~- exactly the technique used when folding egg whites into a souffle mixture with a rubber spatula. Repeat this very lightly and quickly until the whites and batter are thoroughly folded and blended. Once you have mastered this hand technique you can use it for souffles. Again using your hand like a spatula, pour and scrape the batter into three prepared pans, dividing it equally between them. Give the filled pans a little knock on the countertop to level the batter. Put the 3 pans in the center of the oven, or, if you have to use more than 1 rack, stagger them on the 2 middle racks of the oven so they do not overlap. Bake for 25 minutes, then touch the center of each cake lightly with your fingertip. If it springs back, it is done. Remove the pans and put them on wire cake rakes to cool for a few minutes, then loosen the layers by running the flat of a knife blade around the sides of the pans, put a rack on top of each pan, and invert so the cake comes out onto the rack, top side down. Then reverse the layers so they are top side up. For filling and icing, SEE: 1-2-3-4 Filling and Icing recipe.</li>

      <li>When a southern lady, and she is a lady, told me about this cake I responded with utter ignorance. She could not believe that I had never heard of such a thing. The recipe resembles a fine pound cake in terms of both flavor and texture. Sliced thin, with a cup of black coffee, it makes a wonderful southern afternoon snack. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter, sugar, and egg yolks. Mix the flour and baking powder together and sift into the creamed mixture, adding alternately with the milk. Add the flavorings. Whip the egg whites to form stiff peaks and gently fold into the batter. Bake in a loaf pan in a preheated oven at 300ø for 1-1/4 hours, or until a toothpick stuck into the center of the cake comes out clean. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

      <li>The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a lighter loaf. When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset the machine and start again. Some manufacturers produce home bakeries with a whole wheat cycle; if your machine doesn't have one, this start- again method works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS: The gluten gives the whole wheat flour the structure necessary for a good loaf. If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food store. Remember the extra knead. It's especially important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, us this recipe only on the regular bake cycle.

    <title>Banana Caramel Custard</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 1/2 cups While sugar</li>
      <li>4 Medium-sized fully ripe bananas peeled and sliced thinly crosswise</li>
      <li>16 large Eggs</li>
      <li>4 Tall cans; (12 oz.) evaporated</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground nutmeg; (optional)</li>
      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>Strawberries; (or other ripe fruits) for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>http://www.mabuhay.com/phil_reporter/columns/Aling_Choleng/ Have ready 2 sets of pans, two larger, deeper pans (roasting pans) and two smaller pans (9 inches long, 3 inches wide and 3 inches deep for the flan, which will be baked by steaming (ba=F1o maria) by placing these pans with the custard mixture in them into the larger pans and filling these larger pans with hot water to ome up about 2/3 the depth of the sides of the smaller pans. Heat oven to 350 degrees F and place the larger pans with water in them in center of oven. Prepare the custard this way: Caramelize or melt 1 cup of the white granulated sugar in heavy sauce pans over medium heat for 5 minutes - be careful not to burn sugar, keep on tilting the pan to spread sugar. As soon as sugar has melted, pour 1/2 into each of the smaller ans in which the custard will be cooked. Tilt these pans to allow caramel to spread and cover bottoms of pans. In large mixing bowl, combine mashed bananas and 1-1/2 cups sugar and heat with electric mixer to blend and become smooth. Beat in eggs until well blended. lowly add the milk, vanilla and pinch of salt. Beat with electric mixer at low speed until just blended. Divide mixture between the two loaf pans with caramelized sugar on their bottoms. Carefully place smaller pans with custard mixture in them into larger pans with hot water in the oven. Bake for 1-1/2 hours or until custard is set but still soft in center. Remove pans from the oven and let pans with custard coal on wire racks. Place inside the ref before unmolding onto serving platter. Run knife around flan to loosen out sides, then place oval platter over custard pan and flip it over. The caramel will liquify furring overnight stay in the ref and the custard will fall easily onto the platter, with the caramel syrup over it.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>You can turn a yeast bread into a vegetable bread (or fruit bread) simply by taking 1 cup of vegetable puree or fruit puree and substituting it for a cup of the flour in a basic sweet bread or white bread recipe. (If it's a watery puree, you might have to add additional flour, or try using it as a substitute for some of the oil or liquid instead.) You could try this as a basis for a quickbread - it's the best banana bread I've ever tasted: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat shortening in mixer until creamy. Add sugar and eggs, continue beating at medium speed one minute. Add bananas to egg mixture. Mix until blended. Add flour mixture, beating at low speed only until blended. Turn into buttered loaf pan and bake for 1 hour or until toothpick inserted in center of loaf comes out clean. Source: Marge Clark Note: I've had success with this recipe using half brown and half granulated white sugar, also with using 1/2 c strained yogurt in place of the eggs. For a little spice, I add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp mace and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and sift them in with the flour mixture. Use 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin puree instead of the banana and put in 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and you should end up with a nice, moist pumpkin bread. * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627.

Pour into hot jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Adjust lids. Process in boiling water bath (half-pints) 10 minutes. Makes 6 half-pints.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Whole wheat pastry flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups Nonfat buttermilk; (1 pkg)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Egg Beaters® 99% egg substitute</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Banana; medium, sliced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Wheat germ; toasted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine the flour, sugar, and baking soda in a medium-sized bowl, and stir to mix well. Add the buttermilk and egg substitute, and stir to mix well. Fold in the bananas and wheat germ. Coat a griddle or large skillet with nonstick cooking spray, and preheat over medium heat until a drop of water sizzles when it hits the heated surface. If using an electric griddle, heat the griddle according to the manufacturer's directions. For each pancake, our 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle, and spread into a 4-inch circle. Cook for 1 minute and 30 seconds, or until the top is bubble and the edges are dry. Turn and cook for an additional minute, or until the second side is golden brown. As the pancakes are done, transfer them to a serving plate and keep warm in a preheated oven. Serve hot, topped with honey or maple syrup. VARIATION: To make Banana Buckwheat Pancakes, substitute 3/4 cup of buckwheat flour for 3/4 cup of the whole wheat flour.

    <title>Banana Caramel Custard</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>10</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Medium-size slightly overripe bananas; peeled and cut into pieces</li>
      <li>8 large Eggs</li>
      <li>2 cans (12 oz. each) evaporated ; (not sweetened condensed) milk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GARNISH</li>
      <li>Strawberries; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This custard is a great dessert for entertaining because it can be made ahead. It also can be easily doubled and baked in two loaf pans for a large group. 1. Fill a roasting pan or a 13 x 9-inch baking pan half full of hot tap water and place on an oven rack in the center of the oven. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. 2. In a small heavy saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the sugar over medium heat for about 5 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally until the sugar has melted and turns golden brown. (Watch carefully: if it gets too dark it will taste burned.) Immediately pour the mixture into a 9 x 5-inch loaf ppan so the sugar (caramel) covers the bottom of the pan completely. 3. In a large bowl, beat the banana and remaining 3/4 cup of sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until completely liquefied with no lumps. Or process in a food processor. Beat in the eggs (or process) until well-blended. (If using a food processor, scrape the mixture into a large bowl.) 4. Add the evaporated milk, vanilla, nutmeg, and salt. Beat with a mixer on low speed or stir just until blended. Pour the mixture into the loaf pan. (Don't worry if the caramel cracks.) 5. Carefully place the baking pen in the center of the pan of hot water. Bake for 1 hour and 15 to 20 minutes, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean and the top is browned. Remove th e panfrom the water and set on a wire rack to cool completely. When cooled, cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. 6. To serve, run a thin knife around the inside edges of the custard. Invert a serving plate over the pan. Invert the pan and plate together. Lift the pan and allow the syrup to run onto the plate. Serve right away or cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut into 10 slices.

      <li>Chef Frank Brigtsen of Brigtsen's Restaurant in Uptown New Orleans is a fantastic cross between the classic bread pudding and Bananas Foster, the great flaming bananas and ice cream dessert. Preheat the oven to 300F. Put the French bread pieces into a 9x12x2 inch baking pan. In a blender or food processor, blend the eggs, milk, 2/3 cup of sugar, bananas, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla until smooth. Pour this mixture over the French bread pieces. Fold in the raisins and the pecans and let the mixture set for 20 minutes. Top with small pieces of the butter. Cover the pudding with aluminum foil and place the pan into a larger pan. Add warm water to a depth of 1 inch in the larger pan. Bake for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake uncovered for 15 minutes until set. In a deep, medium bowl, whisk the cream just until it begins to thicken. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. Continue whisking unti soft peaks form. Cover and chill. Banana Rum Sauce Heat a large saute pan or skillet over low heat. Add the butter, sugar, bananas, cinnamon and nutmeg. Moving the skillet back and forth, cook until the butter and sugar become creamy and the bananas begin to soften, about one minute. Remove the skillet from heat and add the rum and the liqueur. Return the pan to the heat. Tilt the pan, avert your face and and light the liquid with a long match. Shake the skillet until the flames subside. Add the vanilla, remove from heat and keep warm. To serve, place a large scoop of bread pudding in the middle of each serving plate or bowl. Place 2 slices of banana on each plate and top with about 3 tablespoons of sauce. Spoon the whipped cream over the bread pudding and serve immediately.

      <li>Adjust the water to compensate for different sizes of egg and banana. Measure the dry group into mixing bowl, stir until well blended to evenly distribute the gluten, either let come to room temperature or warm in microwave until slightly warm. Toast the walnuts7 minutes at 275 degrees and cooled a bit. Add the walnuts 8 minutes before end of knead cycle Be sure to mix in the gluten until very well distributed, as described. I keep all my flours in the refrigerator, and warm the mixed flours in the microwave just before starting the bread.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Sift the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, blending well and set aside. Place the vinegar in a measuring cup. Add enough milk to make 2/3 cup and set aside. Cream the shortening and sugar together, in a large mixing bowl, until light and fluffy, using an electric mixer set on medium speed. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk mixture and bananas to the cream mixture, blending well after each addition, using low speed on the mixer. Stir in the walnuts and pour the batter into a greased 13 X 9 X 2-inch baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for about 45 minutes or until a cake tester or wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool, in the pan, on a wire rack until cold to the touch, then frost. PENUCHE FROSTING: Heat the butter in a 2-quart saucepan, over medium heat, until bubbling but not browned. Stir in the brown sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, another 2 minutes. Stir in the milk. Increase the heat to medium and cook until the mixture returns to a boil. Remove from the heat and cool to lukewarm. When the mixture is luke warm, stir in the Confectioners' sugar and beat with a wooden spoon until well blended and thick enough to spread. If necessary, place the pan in a bowl of ice water and beat with a wooden spoon until the frosting reaches a spreading consistency. If the frosting becomes too stiff, warm over low heat.

Place eggplants skin side down in a 13x9x2 oval dish. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons of the marinade over each eggplant half. Rub into flesh so that it runs into the cuts. Turn eggplants skin side up. Pour remaining marinade into the dish. Let stand 45 minutes. Turn eggplants skin side down. Cover tightly with microwave plastic wrap. Cook at high power for 10 minutes. Prick plastic to release steam. Remove, uncover, spoon sauce over eggplants. Serve as side dish. Recommended with grilled fish steak or chicken breast (of course I'd baste that with a soy based marinade). I may try this over a wok steamer rather than in the microwave. WHICH REMINDS ME: Stephen, I love a dish which I have seen referred to as Yu Shaing Eggplant. Based on a Yu Shaing sauce. Which is, to some extent, translated as fish sauce (I know the yu or ju is fish) not made from it but to go with it, I gather. It is certainly not nuoc mam but I don't know if it contains it. It is rather hot and by flavor I would guess it comes from the northern provinces - perhaps NE end of China. I have also had it with fresh pork strings. Glorious. Do you have any idea what it is or a recipe??? I have been unable to find it anywhere in my Chinese library. The restaurant where I eat it is not one to give recipes or ingredients to non-Chinese (if they'd give it to the Chinese. The place is popular with the newer Chinese community here. (The old timers are all Cantonese and so well integrated that they probably consider red beans and rice their dish). From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <title>Asian Beef and Noodle Toss</title>

    <category>Beef</category>
    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Ground beef</li>
      <li>2 packages (3-oz) Oriental flavor instant Ramen noodles</li>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 cups Oriental vegetable mixture; frozen</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Green onion; thin, or chives</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In large, nonstick skillet, brown ground beef over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is no longer pink, breaking up into crumbles. Remove with slotted spoon to plate lined with paper towels; pour off drippings. Put beef onto plate and season it with one seasoning packet from noodles; set aside. In same skillet, combine water, vegetables, noodles (broken into several pieces), ginger, and remaining seasoning packet. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover; simmer 3 minutes or until noodles are tender, stirring occasionally. Return beef to skillet; heat through. Stir in green onion before serving. Mitch's notes: Quick, easy, and good. The original recipe called for 1 cup vegetables. I used two, and you could use more. I used 3/4 pounds of ground beef. That was plenty and could be cut more if you're trying to avoid meat. Chicken or pork should work just fine for this also. Original recipe called for 3/4 inch "crumbles" of meat. I think that's too large. I think I'll use just a little more ginger next time, but this was just fine with the seasoning packets. I added the chives option, since I had those and had no green onions. Works just fine. Original recipe says this serves four. No it doesn't. Recipe by: Mitch's adaptation from Nat. Cattlemen's Beef Assoc.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Phyllo dough, sheets</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Coconut, toasted, shredded</li>
      <li>2 cups Lyche, seeded, halved</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Walnut, roasted, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Raisins, soaked in plum wine</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Ginger, candied</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Asian pear, peeled, diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Zest, lemon</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Five spice, powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Wine, plum</li>
      <li>Sugar, confectioner's</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Filling: ======== Soak your golden raisins in plum wine overnight or longer. Depending on the ingredients available to you, mix appropriate quantities up so as to fill the dough. You can certainly use more or less of each ingredient to suit your individual tastes. You'll need about four cups total filling. Assembly: ========= Spread the two sheets of phyllo dough out on your work surface, one on top of the other. Paint the top layer of dough with some of the melted better and then spread a nice thin layer of toasted coconut over the entire pastry. Pour your filling along the long edge of the phyllo dough, and roll the dough up as tightly as possible (remember to fold in the ends as you roll so the ends are "sealed") and put on a non-stick baking sheet. Paint the top of the roll with melted butter and bake at 350 F until the dough is golden brown. When done, take the strudel out of the oven and let it cool on a rack. Just before serving, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the top. Slice the roll on a diagonal for a more attractive presentation. For elegant presentation, you might serve the strudel pieces on a plate with slices of kiwi, orange, lemon, and pear as garnish.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>

      <li>2 large Carrots; shredded</li>
      <li>1 Sweet red pepper; shredded</li>
      <li>1 Medium-sized yellow zucchini, shredded</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Very finely minced ginger</li>
      <li>2 Cloves finely minced garlic</li>
      <li>Skin from one lime; grated</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Grated orange skin</li>

      <li>1/3 cups Chinese rice wine or dry sherry</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Asian chile sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cornstarch</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe was made by Hugh Carpenter at a cooking class I took at the Draeger's Culinary Center in San Mateo. That day, he used a bell pepper, asparagus, 2 baby bok choy, yellow squash, green onion, and ginger instead of the veggies called for. I usually just use what's available at the store. He also suggests stirring in smoked BBQ chicken, rare roast beef, dungeness crab, or cooked salmon fillet. Advance Preparation: Bring 4 quarts of water to a rapid boil. Lightly salt the water and cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. When the pasta loses its raw texture but is still slightly firm, drain, rinse with cold water, and drain again. Toss the pasta with half of the cooking oil. Cut the carrot into matchstick shaped pieces about 1 inch long and 1/8 inch thick. Cut the red pepper, zucchini, and green onions into pieces the size of the carrots. In a large bowl, toss the vegetables with the pasta until evenly mixed, then refrigerate. In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the sauce. All advance preparation steps may be completed up to 8 hours before you begin the final cooking steps. Final Cooking Steps: Place a 12 or 14 inch sauté pan or a 14 or 16 inch flat bottom wok over the highest heat. When the pan becomes hot, add the remaining 2 tablespoons cooking oil. When the oil becomes hot, add the pasta mixture. Stir and toss the pasta until it begins to become hot and the vegetables brighten, about 5 minutes. Stir the sauce, and then add it to the pasta. Stir and toss the pasta. As soon as the pasta becomes hot, about 3 minutes, taste and adjust the seasonings. Transfer to a heated platter or 4 heated dinner plated. Serve at once.

Puree the broth and the vegetables in batches, in a blender or in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Return the puree to the saucepan, set it over moderate heat and bring the soup just to serving temperature.

      <li>I've made a few more recipes from Gabe Mirkin's book. The Cranberry Beans and Kale was a dud for me (and so not posted here), but I liked the Asian Salad. It also gave me a chance to use my nice Japanese slicer: the Benriner. As with most his recipes, this makes a lot, you may want to halve the recipe. Mix vegetables in a bowl. Mix vinegar and chili-garlic paste together. Pour dressing over vegetables and toss. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #295 by Michelle Dick &lt;artemis@rahul.net&gt; on Dec 14, 97</li>

This was adapted from a recipe by Bruce Cost. It was origianlly called Szechuan, but after I eliminated the oil, and some other stuff, it tasted more Japanese to me, so I compromised and called it "Asian". The chili paste adds a bit of zing, but this is not hot at all. Add more if you like it spicy. Also, the original recipe calls for the cucumbers to be peeled and seeded, but I am too lazy! I rather like it soupy, so seed them if you don't like your salad so soupy... :) Toss together and serve. *Yummy*!!! :) FATFREE DIGEST V96 #50 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Emmenthaler is a dry, aged cheese that accents the flavor of asparagus. Serve as the main course of a light lunch or supper. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Snap coarse ends off asparagus stalks leaving spears about 3 1/2-inches long. (Save the trimmed-off ends to use for soup.) Peel the asparagus spears using a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, lay them flat in a large heavy skillet, pour in boiling salted water and set over moderate heat. Cover and cook asparagus for about 10 minutes, until very tender. Drain well, return to the skillet and shake over moderate heat for 30 seconds or so to dissipate any excess moisture. Arrange the asparagus spears like the spokes of a wheel over the bottom of the pie crust, with their tips pointing toward the center. Combine the milk, cream, eggs, Parmesan cheese, Kirschwasser, salt, dill, mace and pepper, and pour the liquid evenly over the asparagus. Bake the tart, uncovered, for 35 minutes, or until the filling has set. Remove the tart from the oven and cool it for at least 20 minutes before cutting.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Cooked millet</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Mirin or dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 10-oz package of tofu,</li>
      <li>Diced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chopped snow peas</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Rice or cider vinegar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Frozen peas, thawed</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 8-oz can sliced water</li>
      <li>Chestnuts</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar (or other sweetener)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped scallion</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the millet, tofu, snow peas, peas, water chestnuts, and scallion. In a small bowl, stir together the mirin, soy sauce, venegar, garlic, and sugar. Pour over the salad and toss to combine. Although the original recipes didn't say to, I let both of these salads chill for awhile to let the flavors blend before I served them. I think that this step is a particularly good idea for the Asian Millet salad, as it allows the tofu to absorb the flavors of the dressing. If you try these, I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!

      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>3 pounds Chicken; Cut In 10 Pieces</li>
      <li>2 Slices Thick Bacon</li>
      <li>1 1/2 ounces Smoked Ham; Coarsely Chopped</li>
      <li>2 medium Tomatoes; Finely Chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion; Finely Chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium Green Bell Pepper; Finely Chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Capers; Drained</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Pimiento Stuffed Olives; Diced</li>
      <li>2 cups Medium Grain Rice(About 12 Oz); Such As Valencia</li>
      <li>1 cup Green Peas; Fresh Or Frozen</li>
      <li>4 Pimentos; Thinly Sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Parmesan Cheese; grated</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a small bowl, combine the oregano, garlic and salt. Rub the seasonings on the chicken pieces. In a large enameled cast iron casserole, cook the bacon over moderately low heat until the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon and reserve for another use. Add half the chicken and cook over moderately high heat, turning, until browned all over, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate and brown the remaining chicken to the pan and add the ham, tomatoes, onion and green pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat until the chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Let cool. Remover the chicken meant from the bones. Discard the skin and bones and return the meat to the pan. Add 6 1/2 cups of water and the capers and olives and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and 1 teaspoon salt and simmer until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Season the *asopao* with salt. Garnish with the peas and pimientos and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Serve at once; otherwise it will lose its characteristic soupiness. Posted to EAT-L Digest 08 Sep 96 Date: Mon, 9 Sep 1996 13:10:20 -0500 From: Connie Anderson &lt;connie@USA.NET&gt; NOTES : PUERTO RICO: *Asapao* This island's culinary heritage is a wonderful mix of Spanish, African, Taino and more--all of which have a role in *asopao* de pollo*, a chicken stew that's a country cousin of Spain's paella. Asapao can be as basic as the rural "three can" variation, in which chicken and rice are fancied up with a can of green peas, a can of pimientos and a can of asparagus tips, or it can be a sublime dish that brings out the flavors of the freshest of ingredients.</li>

In a large pot of boiling water cook the noodles for 2 minutes or until al dente, stirring to separate the strands. Drain, rinse with cold water and shake dry in a colander. Fill a small shallow dish with warm water. Immerse one sheet of rice paper in the water and let stand until pliable, about 45 seconds. Transfer rice paper to paper towels to drain. Transfer drained rice paper to a work surface. Lay one piece of lettuce over the bottom third of the rice paper. Arrange 1 tablespoon of the rice noodles, 1 tablespoon of the shredded carrot, some bean sprouts and 2 mint leaves, end to end, on the lettuce leaf. Roll up the paper halfway into a cylinder and fold both sides of the paper over the filling. Lay 2 shrimp halves, cut side down and end to end, along the crease.

      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lime juice</li>

      <li>24 ounces Sea bass fillets, or grouper (remove skin; one fillet per serving)</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Mint leaves, minced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The fillets should be the same thickness so they cook in the same amount of time. The packets can be prepared several hours ahead and refrigerated until ready to cook. Combine coconut milk, ginger, sugar, lime juice, fish sauce and salt in small dish. Center each fillet on aluminum foil and bring up sides of foil close to edges of each fillet. Top each fillet with 3 tablespoons coconut milk mixture and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon mint. Fold together edges of foil to make 4 airtight packets. Place packets in single layer on baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees until fish is cooked through, about 18 minutes for 1-inch-thick fillets. Serve hot, at room temperature or chilled. 4 servings.

It has a loud fishy aroma and, in small quantities, it gives an indispensable authentic flavor to many Southeast Asian dishes. You can find fish sauce at Asian grocery stores and sometimes in the Asian sections of supermarkets. -- AM GOOD COOKING: An Asian Meal for All Seasons. ** MENU * ASIAN FISH PACKETS * THIN NOODLES WITH CARROTS, GREEN ONIONS AND CILANTRO * ORANGE CAKE WITH ORANGE SYRUP ** I've adapted these recipes for grouper in coconut milk and noodles with carrots from some dishes I tried at LE COLONIAL, A SMALL INDOCHINESE RESTAURANT IN ST. BARTH'S IN THE FRENCH WEST INDIES. ** This is a most appealing, upbeat meal. And although I like these dishes served hot, they are also good served at room temperature or chilled in hot weather. Snow peas make an excellent addition to the plate. ** A warm orange cake served with warm orange syrup from Maya's, a restaurant perched right on the water's edge, is a delicious finish for the meal.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Ground Lamb</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Fresh Asian or reg. Basil (finely chopped)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Minced Fresh Coriander</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Finely chopped Ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Finely chopped Garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Sichuan Peppercorns roasted and ground</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Coarse. chopped dried chiles</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Rice wine or dry sherry</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Chinese sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Caul fat or crepinette</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is an Asian twist on a French appetizer. Caul fat can be ordered from your local butcher. SOAK THE CAUL FAT in a bowl of cold water; this will allow the caul fat to unravel easily. In a medium-sized bowl, mix the ground lamb with all the ingredients except the caul fat. Cut the caul fat into 20 (5-inch) squares. Lay out a square of caul fat and place several tablespoons of lamb mixture onto one end. Fold the sides in to form a package. Repeat until you have used up all the lamb. Recipe can be done ahead to this point and refrigerated. Wrap the crepinettes well in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Approximately 40 minutes before you are ready to cook, make a charcoal fire and, when the coals are ash white, grill the crepinettes for about 8 minutes on each side, or until they are done (firm to the touch).

      <li>You can use either almonds or walnuts in this recipe-each gives a very different flavor. In a small saucepan, place apricots and cover with water. Cook, covered, over low heat for 15 minutes. Drain, and when apricots are cool enough to handle, chop finely. Set aside. Preheat oven to 350ø. Grease 8 x 8-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, beat butter, sugar and 1 cup flour until well mixed and crumbly; pat into bottom of pan. Bake 20 minutes at 350ø or just until golden. While batter is in oven, use the same bowl to mix all remaining ingredients (including apricots) except confectioners sugar. Pour over baked layer and return to oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven; cool in pan before cutting in squares or oblongs with a sharp knife. Dust with confectioners sugar. Yield: 16-20 squares or oblongs.

      <li>3/4 cups Sugar plus additional for coating ramekins</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh lemon juice</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
      <li>5 large Egg whites</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Cream of tartar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a heavy saucepan simmer apricots, water and 1/2 cup sugar, covered, 20 minutes. Transfer hot mixture to a food processor and puree until very smooth. Force puree through a fine sieve into a bowl and stir in lemon juice, rum, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Cool puree completely. Puree may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring puree to room temperature before proceeding. Transfer puree to a large bowl. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter six 7-ounce (3 1/2 by 1 3/4-inch) ramekins and coat with additional sugar, knocking out excess. In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with a pinch of salt until foamy. Beat in cream of tartar and beat whites until they hold soft peaks. Beat in remaining 1/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, and beat meringue until it just holds stiff peaks. Whisk about one fourth meringue into puree to lighten and fold in remaining meringue gently but thoroughly. Ladle batter into ramekins and bake souffles on a baking sheet in middle of oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until puffed, golden brown and just set in center. Remove ramekins from oven. With 2 forks pull open center of each souffle and pour some creme anglaise into each opening. Serve immediately.

Coarsely chop the chicken breast and toss it with the lettuce, blending well. Peel, seed, and cube a ripe papaya. Put 1-1/2 cups of the fruit on top of the salad (store remainder refrigerator). Do not stir. Drizzle with raspberry vinaigrette dressing (from Sunset's Salads or commercial: Girard's or S&amp;W's). Chill the salad in freezer while you preheat oven and bake the cresant rolls.

Round dough into ball; place in greased bowl; brush lightly with melted shortening. Cover and let rise in warm place until double in size, about 1 hour. While dough is rising, prepare filling. For filling, combine apricots, water, lemon juice and sugar in medium-sized saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until thickened. Cool. Punch dough down; cover; let rest 10 minutes. Roll to form an 18x12-inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter; spread with filling. Starting with long side, roll up as for jelly roll. Form into circle on greased cooky sheet, sealed edge down. Make cuts 2/3 of way through ring at 1-inch intervals. Turn one section to left and next to right. Repeat around ring. [Cut edges showing a spiral of filling will be exposed, and parallel with the work surface. --K.M.] Brush lightly with melted shortening. Cover; let rise in warm place until nearly double in size, about 45 minutes. Bake in preheated moderate oven (350 F.) 20 to 25 minutes. Drizzle with confectioner's sugar frosting while still warm.

Mix pistachios, coconut, almonds and 3/4 cup flour in large bowl. Add fruit mixture and toss. Mix remaining 3/4 cup flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt and baking soda in medium bowl. Whisk 6 tablespoons bourbon, buttermilk and orange juice in small bowl. Using electric mixer, cream butter, remaining 1 cup sugar and lemon peel in large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Fold in fruit mixture. Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake until toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool cakes in pans on racks 15 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks; peel off paper. Turn cakes right side up. Mix remaining 4 tablespoons bourbon with peach preserves in small bowl. Brush mixture over top and sides of warm cakes. Cool completely.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* The old country way is a mixture of 1/3 beef, 1/3 pork and 1/3-veal ground together. But I think beef is much better. ** Heaping Tsp., save time by using the jar of pre-chopped garlic. Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl with your hands making sure everything is well mixed. Form into meatballs and fry *** in a large skillet with about 1/2 cup olive oil over medium high heat. Turn on all sides to brown and cook through. When all the way cooked, add them to your sauce and let them cook slowly for about 1 hour. *** Can also be browned in the oven on a baking or broiler rack. This will produce less greasy but also drier meatballs. Note: April's ancestors (on both sides) go back to Italy. I don't think the same is true for her husband!

    <recipetext>
      <li>From "375 Great Cookies &amp; Brownies," by Joanne Lamb Hayes and Bonnie Tandy Leblang (HarperCollins, 1993, $16.95). In medium bowl, beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Beat in egg and almond extract until light and fluffy. Mix together flour, baking powder, salt and add, beat on low speed until dough is smooth, scraping down sides of bowl frequently with a rubber spatula. Wrap dough and refrigerate 2-3 hours, until firm. Meanwhile, finely chop dried apricots. In a small bowl stir together apricots and honey. Set apricot filling aside at room temperature until dough has chilled. Heat oven to 350'F. Between pieces of waxed paper, roll out dough 1/8" thick. Cut out cookies with 2" round cutter. Reroll scraps to make additional cookies. Place half of cookies 2" apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon apricot filling into center of cookies. Moisten edges of cookies with water and top with remaining cookies to make a sandwich. Press edges together with fingertips to seal. Pierce center of each "pillow" with tines of fork. Bake 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown. Let cookies cool 2 minutes on sheets, then remove to racks and cool completely. Store in a tightly covered container. Makes about 20 cookies.

      <li>1/3 cups Fat-free yogurt</li>

      <li>1 Egg white</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dried fruit; (such as apricots)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Thoroughly grind rolled oats in food processor or blender. Mix with flour and baking powder. Chop dried fruit into small pieces. You could use apricots, raisins, dates, dried apples, dried cranberries, or anything else you like. In a separate bowl, "cream" together yogurt, fructose, and honey. In yet another bowl, lightly beat egg white until it gets bubbly but not stiff. Fold egg white into the wet ingredients. Add dried fruit. Combine wet and dry ingredients. The dough gets pretty stiff and is hard to mix. You may even have to knead it with your hands like bread dough! Roll out into a log shape and chop into 12 patties (these are smaller than the store-bought ones -- you could probably make them bigger if you want). Bake at 325 degrees F for 15 minutes on non-stick cookie sheet. Cool completely and store in refrigerator. These keep well and may be frozen.

      <li>Another of my scores this weekend was "from SOUP to DESSERT with the NEW Irradiated PET MILK". That's a book title believe it or not. It's copyrighted 1934 by Pet Milk company. I was naturally curious as to why they were nuking Pet Milk in 1934. That screwed up my historical perspective pretty good, but it turns out that "irradiated" refers to running the milk under an ultraviolet light to increase vitamin D content, not making it glow in the dark. So once my reality check had subsided and I paged through the book, I saw this which made me think of you. 1. In a 9-inch skillet melt 3 tablespoons butter. 2. Remove from heat and sprinkle with 1/2 cup brown sugar. 3. Arrange on sugar 24 canned apricot halves. Let stand while mixing batter. 4. Beat until very light 2 eggs. 5. Add, while beating, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. 6. Heat to boiling point: 1/4 cup Pet Milk diluted with 1/4 cup water and 1 Tbl shortening. 7. ea Beat into egg mixture. 8. Sift together: 1 cup sifted cake flour and1 tsp baking powder. 9. ea Add milk mixture beating quickly but thoroughly. 10. lb over apricots. 11. ea Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 25 to 30 minutes or until cake shrinks from sides of pan. Turn out while warm and serve with Whipped Pet Milk Topping. Serves 6. That's all pretty straight forward. What it shows in the pictures but not in the text is that the cake is baked in a cast-iron skillet like a nice mess of cornbread. Here's the topping though I can't help but think it's a tad redundant. WHIPPED PET MILK (as a topping): Soak for 5 minutes: 1/4 tsp granulated gelatin in 1 tsp cold water. Scald in top of double boiler: 1/2 cup Pet Milk. Add gelatin and stir until dissolved. Pour into bowl and chill until icy cold. Then whip with rotary beater until stiff. Fold in 1 Tbl powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. Makes about 1 1/2 cups...Serves 8. NOTE: The following flavorings may be substituted for the vanilla: 2 t orange extract 1 t lemon extract 1/2 t almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract 1/2 t peppermint extract 4 dr oil of peppermint Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; September 7, 1992.

      <li>Use firm, slightly underripe fruit. Peel and cut into lengthwise slices: apricots or peaches. The fruit may be dipped briefly into boiling water to facilitate the removal of skins. Remove the stones. Measure the fruit. Allow to each cup: 3/4C sugar, 2tbsp water, 1-1/2tsp lemon juice. Stir this syrup and cook it 5min. Add the fruit. You may omit the water and just pour the sugar over the apricots/peaches, letting them stand 2 hours before continuing. Simmer fruit til transparent. Place in glasses or jars. If the syrup seems too abundant, place the fruit in jars and reduce the syrup til thick. Pour over fruit. Add to the syrup(if desired): lemon juice -- about 2tsp to every cup of fruit.

    <recipetext>
      <li>hot water Cook apricots and sugar to setting point, continually skimming off foam. Shortly before done, add lemon juice. Remove from heat. Stir in 'Preserving Aid' dissolved in hot water. Pour into hot, dry, sterilized jars. Seal jars with cellophane the top of which has been dipped in rum and smooth the overhang over the jars' necks, tying with thin twine. Makes 12 half-liter jars and one quarter-liter jar. (Between 13 and 14 1 pint jars). "Einsiedehilfe" ('Preserving Aid') is sold (in Austria) in 15 gram packages and consists of 65 percent sugar and 35 percent benzoic acid. To test for setting point: Spoon a little of the conserve onto a chilled saucer. Leave for a few minutes - then hold saucer upside down. If conserve doesn't run, then setting point has been reached.

    <title>Apricot or Cherry Liqueur</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Dried apricots or dried pitted sour cherries</li>
      <li>1 Bottle (1.75 liter) vodka</li>
      <li>4 cups Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe By: Sunset Magazine Prep Time: 15 minutes, plus at least 2 weeks for mellowing Makes: About 8 cups of apricot or 7 1/3 cups cherry liqueur 1. Place apricots or cherries, vodka, and sugar in a glass jar (at least 3-quart size). Stir until sugar is mostly dissolved. Cover tightly and let stand at least 2 weeks or up to 2 months; after a few days shake jar until sugar completely dissolves. Cherry liqueur may form a slightly cloudy, harmless residue at the top of the jar. 2. Pour lqueur and fruit, a portion at a time, through a fine strainer into a pitcher, letting fruit drain completely. Save fruit for other uses (recipe suggestion follows later). Line strainer with four layers of damp cheesecloth, set over a spouted container, and pour liqueur through it. Or for maximum clarity, strain liqueur through a coffee filter, changing filter often (takes several hours). 3. Pour liqueur into small airtight bottles. Serve liqueur, or store uptight up to 6 months. (If storing in containers with rubber stoppers, place a couple of layers of plastic wrap between rubber and bottle to keep alcohol from softening rubber). Notes: Slab apricots are the sweetest dried apricots; they're picked extra-ripe and soft, and are slightly misshapen. Inexpensive vodka works fine. Serving Ideas for Fruit Liqueurs: * Drizzle over ice cream for an instant but elegant dessert * Add a little to mixed fresh fruit, spoon over pound cake * Splash into sparkling wine for a festive aperitif * Flavor holiday fruit cakes with liqueur instead of rum * Sip and smack your lips happily Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 184 by Mandy Rose Bell &lt;mbell@gladstone.uoregon.edu&gt; on Oct 30, 1997</li>

    <category>Cooking liv</category>
    <quantity>36</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: COOKIE DOUGH</li>
      <li>2 Sticks soft unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Unsifted confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>2 large Egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 1/3 cups All purpose bleached flour</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FINISHING</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Apricot jam</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer set at medium speed until soft and light. Beat in sugar and continue beating until sugar is completely incorporated. Beat in yolks, one at a time, beating smooth between each addition, scraping bowl and beaters occasionally. Sift flour over butter and egg mixture and fold in with a rubber spatula, making sure flour is completely absorbed. 2. Stretch a piece of plastic wrap on a plate or cookie sheet and scrape dough onto wrap. Cover with another piece of plastic wrap and press dough into a 10-inch square, about 1/2-inch thick. Chill dough until firm, about 2 hours. 3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cover 2 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment or foil. Divide dough into quarters and remove one quarter at a time from refrigerator to roll. 4. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and lightly flour dough. Pound dough gently with rolling pin to soften it and roll dough to an 8-inch square about 3 1/6-inch thick. Cut dough into rounds with a plain 1 3/4 to 2-inch cutter. Arrange rounds on pans, about 1-inch apart, as they are cut. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough, refrigerating scraps between each rolling. After all the dough has been rolled and cut, press scraps together and re-roll them to make more cookie bases. 5. Count bases and make a hole in half the bases with a cutter or pastry tube in the center of each. Place pans of cookies in oven and immediately lower temperature to 325 degrees. Bake the cookies about 20 minutes, until they are pale golden and firm. Cool on pans on racks. 6. To finish cookies, lightly dust the pierced cookie bases with confectioners' sugar. Arrange unpierced bases, upside down, on a clean pan. Bring jam to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat and strain; allow jam to reduce for a minute or two, until slightly thickened. Gently spoon about 1/4 teaspoon of jam on each unpierced base, spreading it to within 1/8-inch of the edge. Top with pierced cookies. Place remaining jam in a small plastic bag and force it into one corner. Snip a small hole in the corner and squeeze a drop of jam into each opening in tops of cookies. Allow jam to dry. 7. To store, arrange cookies in layers with wax parchment paper between in an airtight container.

      <li>1/2 cups Whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Coarsely chopped walnuts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Sun, 28 Apr 1996 05:25:53 GMT From: Anne Sheresky &lt;sheresky@worldchat.com&gt; Place the apricots on a chopping block. Sprinkle 1 T flour over them. Dip a knife into the flour and chop the apricots finely. Flour the knife often to keep the cut up fruit from sticking together. Sift the remaining flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar into a large bowl. Combine the milk, egg, orange peel, and oil. Stir the flour mixture and the whole wheat flour. Fold in the cut up apricots, any flour left on the cutting block and the walnuts. Pour into a well greased, floured bakin unit. Cover and place on a rack in the slow cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Serve warm or cold. Now before you all ask what a baking unit is (I wondered as I sat and typed this in), I looked it up in the front of the bread section. She says that some manufacturers are making units for slow cookers, but if you don't have one, a 2 pound coffee can works. Pyrex muffin cups also work. Also 1, 1 1/2 and 2 quart molds work. 4-6 servings. Do not lift the lid while baking this bread.

      <li>1 teaspoon Active dry yeast</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Starter: To make the starter called Biga pour the warmed water into a glass bowl, pre-warmed by rinsing in hot water. Add a pinch of sugar &amp; the yeast, stir briefly, &amp; let mixture stand for 10 minutes or so in a warm spot, until it looks creamy &amp; bubbly. Then mix in the flour &amp; the other water. This concoction should then be allowed to ferment, covered with plastic wrap, anywhere from 6 - 24 hours or more, depending on the temperature. The longer it ferments the stronger the flavor it imparts to the bread. If the mix separates noticeably &amp; a clear liquid settles to the bottom, it's reaching the outer limits of use. If the starter begins to turn pink TOSS IT OUT!! Bread: Pour all wet ingredients into bread machine baking pan. Measure all other ingredients except yeast into baking pan. Sprinkle yeast over dry ingredients, being careful not to get yeast wet. Use regular bake cycle on your machine for this loaf. Recipe by: More Recipes for Your Bread Machine Bakery by R. W.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 large Oranges</li>
      <li>1 pint Italian ice; any flavor, or Spumoni ice cream</li>
      <li>4 ounces Galliano</li>
      <li>1/2 pints Whipping cream; whipped stiff</li>
      <li>2 ounces Creme de Cacao</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Cut off top and bottom of each orange to a thickness of 1/4 in. Set aside tops and bottoms. 2. Using a paring knife, separate rind from pulp by inserting knife between rind and pulp and cutting with a rotating motion. When properly separated, pulp should easily slip out by pressing with fingers, leaving hollowed orange rind intact. Discard pulp. 3. Through top opening of rind, replace bottom rind disc so that rind will hold filling. 4. Fill each rind with Italian ice or spumoni. 5. Using any kitchen utensil, make a hole in center of ice or spumoni about the width of a finger. Fill with Galliano. 6. Top with 1 in. to 2 in. whipped cream. 7. Make a similar hole in whipped cream and fill with Creme de Cacao. 8. Cap with reserved rind tops. Serve immediately.

A very popular fruit square that's baked in two layers. Be sure to start the apricots for the topping before you make the base so they can cool. Butter an 8 x 8 inch pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cream the butter with the sugar, add the flour and the vanilla, blending well, then press into the bottom of the pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Topping: Boil the apricots for about ten minutes in water to cover, drain and cool. Combine the eggs with the brown sugar and beat until light. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt and add to the egg mixture. Add apricots, nuts and vanilla. Blend mixture and spread evenly over base. Return to oven and bake about 30 - 35 minutes. Cool. Cut into squares and dust with confectioner's sugar. Makes 16 squares. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /COOKIES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>recipes I just downloaded from Cooking Light's website (sorry, my MC is down right now). When your energy level is fading fast, these muffins are your ticket for a boost. Dried apricots and farina cereal increase the recipe's iron content. 1. Preheat oven to 400ø. 2. Combine apple juice and apricots in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with heavy-duty plastic wrap, and vent. Microwave at high 3 minutes or until apricot mixture boils. Let stand, covered; cool completely. Drain apricots in a colander over a bowl, reserving apple juice. 3. Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups, and level with a knife. Combine the flour and the next 5 ingredients (flour through nutmeg) in a medium bowl, and make a well in center of mixture. Combine 3 tablespoons reserved apple juice, margarine, vanilla, egg whites, and yogurt; stir well with a whisk. Add to flour mixture, stirring just until moist. Stir in reserved apricots. 4. Spoon batter into 12 muffin cups coated with cooking spray. Bake at 400ø for 20 minutes or until muffins spring back when touched lightly in center. Remove muffins from pans immediately; place on a wire rack. Dip muffin tops in remaining apple juice; sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Yield: 1 dozen (serving size: 1 muffin).

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Skinless boneless turkey roast</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Unsweetened apricot preserves</li>
      <li>1 cup Reconstituted dried onion soup mix</li>
      <li>6 slices Day-old challah or white bread</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's a fat-free Thanksgiving recipe from my cookbook "Secrets of Fat-Free Kosher Cooking" by Deborah Bernstein, M.D. Follow the simple steps below for a turkey roast that is amazingly moist and tender. Watch turkey carefully while it cooks and take it out just when it's done. Overcooked turkey is dry and correctly cooked turkey has a texture similar to chicken. 1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly coat a medium baking dish with olive oil cooking spray. 2. Place the turkey in the baking dish and cover it with the apricot preserves. 3. Soak each slice of bread with onion soup. Completely cover the turkey with the bread. 4. Bake for 1 hour, or until the juices from the turkey run clear. The center of the roast should be slightly pink. 5. Mash the bread and serve it with slices of the roasted turkey.

      <li>1 cup Finely chopped dried apricots</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(1:261/1000)) I noticed someone in here was requesting apricot recipes and someone else is partial to white chocolate, so to kill two birds with one scone (ga ka ka ka ka) here is a delicious scone recipe from one of my parents' cookbooks. They lived in England for three years, where scones are virtually the staff of life. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, stir together the cream, egg, and vanilla. Add the cream mixture to the flour mixture and knead until combined. Knead in the white chocolate, walnuts, and apricots. With lightly floured hands, pat the dough out on a floured work surface to a thickness of 5/8 inch. Cut circles in the dough with a biscuit cutter. Gather the scraps of dough together and repeat till all the dough is used. Bake scones on ungreased baking sheet for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned on top. Place baking sheet on wire rack for 5 minutes, then transfer scones to wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container. Makes 8 or 9 scones. * (Sue speaking) You can use those "Nestles Treasures" white chocolate chips, but before they came out with those, I used to use a Nestle Alpine White With Almonds bar, smashed into pieces. I would then omit the walnuts and substitute half the vanilla extract with almond extract for a delicious variation. ** To toast walnuts, place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the sheet a couple of times, until the nuts are fragrant.

      <li>2 cups Arborio rice</li>
      <li>3 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 cup Grated Pecorino</li>
      <li>2 Eggs plus; 2 eggs separated</li>
      <li>1 cup Basic tomato sauce</li>
      <li>8 ounces Salted sardines, rinsed, heads removed; and roughly ch</li>
      <li>2 Sprigs mint</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Flour for dusting</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Bread crumbs for coating</li>
      <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>FOR RICE: In a 4 to 6-quart saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil until just smoking. Add half the chopped red onion and saffron and cook until softened, about 7 to 9 minutes. Add rice and chicken stock and bring to boil, uncovered. Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 25 minutes. Spread rice out to cool on a large cookie sheet, about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick. When rice is cool, mix with Pecorino, 2 eggs and 2 egg yolks and set aside FOR STUFFING: In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, cook remaining chopped onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, chopped sardines and mint and cook 5 to 7 minutes until reduced by one third and quite thick. Set aside and allow to cool. TO ASSEMBLE: Place dusting flour, egg whites and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls and lightly beat egg whites. To form aracine, place 3 tablespoons rice mixture in palm of hand and make an indentation with the back of a spoon. Spoon 2 tablespoons sardine mixture into indentation and form an open bowl out of the rice in your hand. Cover filled portion with another tablespoon of rice mixture and using both hands, shape the rice into a ball. Continue with remaining rice mixture and stuffing until done. Roll each ball in flour, then egg whites, then bread crumbs and refrigerate 1 hour, uncovered. Heat 4 inches of cooking oil in fryer or deep frying pan to 375 degrees. Carefully place 3 balls at a time into pan and fry until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring with tongs or kitchen spoon to keep them moving. Drained cooked balls on paper towels and place on large platter and serve either warm or at room temperature.

      <li>1/4 cups Firmly packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cold water</li>
      <li>3 cups Fresh peaches, peeled,, sliced in quarters</li>
      <li>1 cup Fresh blueberries</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons White sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>Lots of vanilla ice cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Make topping first: Mix flour, 1/2 cup white sugar and baking powder. Add milk and 1/4 cup butter. Stir until all lumps are gone. Set aside. Next, in a medium saucepan, stir together brown sugar and cornstarch; add water. Add peaches and blueberries. Cook and stir gently over medium heat until bubbly. Add lemon juice and 1 tablespoon butter and stir until butter melts. Pour in an ungreased baking dish and spoon mounds of topping over the hot filling. Sprinkle with mixture of remaining white sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon. To avoid spillover in the oven, place baking dish on top of a cookie sheet. Bake cobbler in a 350°F oven for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the crust comes out clean. Serve warm with ice cream, or if you are feeling frisky, whipped cream. If blueberries are not available, you can add one additional cup of peaches to the recipe. NOTES : According to the author, Marilyn Schiveley, of Folsom, it's a "killer" because it's so good. "It's to die for," she said. "My aunt and uncle had a peach ranch in Colorado back in the 1950's, and this is a tried and true, never-fail recipe that gets rave reviews every time."

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 large Chicken, quartered</li>
      <li>2 Carrots, peeled and diced</li>
      <li>1 Shallot, sliced</li>
      <li>4 Pippin apples**</li>
      <li>1 pound White mushrooms, washed and minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Oil</li>
      <li>2 Onions - one sliced, one studded with cloves</li>
      <li>1 cup Dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic</li>
      <li>Thyme leaves</li>
      <li>Bay leaves</li>
      <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup Creme fraiche or whipping cream**</li>
      <li>1 Shot glass (1 Tablespoon) Calvados**</li>
      <li>3 Egg yolks</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>**For the apples I used Granny Smith's. For the creme fraiche or whipping cream, I used the whipping cream. For the Calvados - which would have been too expensive to use, even if I had located it over here, I substituted an apple flavored liqueur and just added a little brandy. (Calvados is a dry apple brandy from Calvados in Northern France - very good, but I couldn't find it locally) In a cast iron casserole, lightly brown the chicken in half the butter and 2 Tablespoons oil. When all the pieces are nice and golden. add the carrots, shallots and the sliced onion and cook for a few minutes. Pour the white wine and 1 cup of water over the chicken, then add the clove studded onion and the garlic. Add some thyme leaves and bay leaves and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat for 40 minutes. (While this was cooking the 40 minutes, I peeled and minced the mushrooms - I know everyone tells me there is no need to peel the mushrooms, but I always do &lt;g&gt;) Remove the chicken from the heat, arrange the pieces of chicken in an ovenproof serving dish and keep warm. Pass the cooking liquid through a sieve. Set the vegetables aside and keep warm. Meanwhile melt the remaining butter in a skillet with the oil, add the apples and cook until just lightly brown on all sides. Remove the apples from the skillet and arrange them around the chicken. Keep the dish warm in the oven. Saute the mushrooms until they have lost all their juices. Set aside to add to the sauce. To make the sauce: Pour the strained cooking liquid into a saucepan and set over medium heat. With a whisk, beat in the cream, the calvados and the egg yolks in that order. Simmer in a double boiler until it has thickened to a light cream. Stir in the mushrooms and the vegetables, discarding the clove-studded onion. Adjust seasoning. Remove the dish from the oven, spoon some of the sauce over the chicken and pour the remaining sauce into a sauceboat and serve.

    <title>Aunt Elsie's Cream Cheese Dough Cookies</title>
    <category>Cookies</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Butter; Softened</li>
      <li>1 pound Cream cheese</li>
      <li>1 pound All Purpose Flour</li>
      <li>Assorted Canned Fruit Fillings; Such As Solo Brand Pastry Fillings</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cream butter and cream cheese together. Gradually blend in flour until a slighty soft dough forms. Wrap dough in plastix wrap, and refrigerate about 2 hours, or until firm. On a floured board, roll dough out to a thickness of about 1/3 inch.Using 2-3 inch round cookie cutter, cut out several circles. Either using a doughnut cutter the same diameter, or a canape cutter or bottle cap, cut out center of half the circles. On an ungreased cookie sheet, place the solid circles, being careful to leave adequate space between cookies. (These do not spread much but they do puff up in height.) Using circles tha thave the centers cut out, place on top of solid circles. Using a small spoon, fill each cookie with the fruit filling of your choice.Filkl just up to top of dough. Bake at 375 degrees, about 12-15 minutes, or until puffed up and beginning to turn golden. Let cool on cookie sheeys for about three minutes and then transfer to rack to complete cooling. Seaqsonal hoilday shape cutters may be used as well. Bottle caps or matching canape cutters can be used to cut out the centers. These do not store doe more than a couple of days at room temperature. Refrigerate in the unlikely event that there are a lot of leftovers. Serving Ideas : Thse look very attrractive when arramged on a platter. NOTES : For those who are careful about sugar consumption - the cookies can be filled with all fruit spreads as well as canned fillings. Actually, almost any thick preserves will do. Just don't use any jelly or any spread that is too thin, as they melt and run all over in the oven. Do not use pie fillngs as these are also too thin. Recipe may be doubled or more.

      <li>submitted by: ewebber@pioneer.net (Alecia Webber, Albany, Oregon) As the weather heats up, so does the need for some cool refreshment!! Home made ice cream is the only way to go!! Mix the above ingredients very well. Pour into an ice cream freezer (we still use the hand cranked kind) If there is still room in the ice cream container, fill almost to the top with whole milk. Be careful, though, as the ice cream swells as it freezes. We usually serve this ice cream with a freshly baked angel food cake and sliced strawberries. A perfect end to a summer evening meal!

    <recipetext>
      <li>Hi all, Here's a S.African 2 cents worth. An old fashioned and rather different recipe from "Leipoldt's Cape Cookery" by the late poet, doctor and and cook C.Louis Leipoldt. First: a bit of explanation of terms. "Brinjal"=Eggplant, "Blatjang"=chutney. Dr Leipoldt didn't believe in weighing down recipes with anything as mundane as measurements. His explanations assume that you have good "cooking sense", as I know you all do. This is called "Aubergine with Pine Kernels". I quote verbatim. "Select your brinjal with care, choosing a moderate-sized one with firm and thick flesh; peel it thinly and cut it in slices, on which you strew salt. Let the brinjal lie till most of the water has been extracted, then wipe the slices and dust them with fine flour which you have previously mixed with powdered white pepper, ginger and nutmeg. Slice and brown some onions with fat, lay on them the brinjal slices and strew over them plenty of pine kernels. Then add enough sherry to cover them and stew with the lid closed till everything is well blended. A little chilli and blatjang added much improves it."

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 cups Defatted chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 Corn ears, kernels removed, cobs reserved and halved crosswise (see note below)</li>
      <li>4 Fresh dill sprigs (including stems) PLUS</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chopped fresh dill</li>
      <li>4 Red-skinned new potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1/4" dice</li>
      <li>2 cups Low-fat plain yogurt</li>
      <li>3 Cucumbers, peeled, seeded and cut into small dice</li>
      <li>1 small Red bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into 1/4" dice</li>
      <li>Coarsely ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Whenever cold soups call for chicken broth, be sure to defat it completely for best results. Also, black pepper is the only spice in this chowder, so freshly ground is a MUST. 1. Place broth, corn cobs and dill sprigs in a heavy pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer 10 minutes. Discard cobs and dill. 2. Add potatoes to broth and cook for 8 minutes or until tender. Add corn kernels and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat; pour soup through a strainer, reserving vegetables and broth. 3. Place yogurt and 2/3 of the diced cucumbers in the bowl of a food processor; pulse on and off just to combine ingredients (so some texture remains). With motor on, pour in 1 cup of reserved broth through feed tube and pulse machine on to just combine ingredients. Remove to a bowl. Save any leftover broth for another use. 4. Stir in the reserved vegetables, remaining diced cucumber, bell pepper and chopped dill. Season with fresh black pepper. Refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Serve chilled. Per 1-cup serving: 212 calories, 2 grams fat, 5 milligrams cholesterol. NOTE: If you like, cut 3 more ears of corn (with kernels) into 1" lengths and cook separately for 2-3 minutes. Then divide corn between bowls and ladle soup on top. From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.

Roast the duck until crisp and golden, about 1 hour, occasionally brushing with honey-vinegar mixture. Cool. With a sharp knife, remove the skin from each side of the breast and cut into thin slivers. Remove the meat from each side of the breast and cut it into thin slivers. Combine the slivers of skin and the slivers of duck, reserve 1 cup. The remainder of the duck can be saved for another use. For Dressing: In a small bowl, blend together the dressing ingredients and set aside. In a wok or wide casserole, heat 2 inches of vegetable oil over high heat to 450 F. Carefully, add mai fun noodles, in a few seconds they will puff. Turn carefully with a skimmer and cook the other side. Remove the noodles and drain on paper towels. Break up the noodles and arrange them on 4 chilled serving plates. Scatter shredded lettuce over the noodles and top with the reserved duck. Garnish with scallions and cilantro. Stir dressing and drizzle a small amount over each salad. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve, passing remaining dressing separately.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Stephen Ceideburg</li>
      <li>2 small Aubergines</li>
      <li>1 large Spanish onion</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Chilli powder</li>
      <li>1 slice Terasi</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 large Tomatoes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a relish which can be used hot or cold. Slice the aubergine and sprinkle it with salt; leave to stand for half an hour, then rinse and dry. Cut up the tomatoes and remove the seeds. Crush the terasi and garlic together. Slice the onion thinly, and fry until slightly brown. Add the garlic and terasi, the sugar and the chilli powder. Put in the aubergine, and mix well. Add the tomatoes, cover the pan, and continue cooking gently for 5 minutes. Taste, and add salt if necessary. Then put the mixture into a pudding basin and steam it for 20 minutes. If you want this relish to be really hot--spicy hot--then take 4 green chillis, seed them and chop finely, and put them into the frying-pan at the same time as the onions. Alternatively, use dried red chillis: soak them for at least 15 minutes and put them into the mixture, whole, when everything goes into the basin for steaming.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dry mustard</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 small Onion, chopped fine</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons Celery seed</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix all ingredients together. I use my blender then I don't have to chop the onions. This will keep several weeks in a jar with a plastic lid. Do not use a metal lid, since the vinegar will rust the lid. You can adjust the sugar and salt to suit your own taste. We find that 1 1/4 c sugar is too much, and so is 2 t of salt. The dressing is especially good on a fresh fruit or spinach salad. This recipe comes from my Husband's Aunt, Ann Mitchell.

    <category>Usenet</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Double cream</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>6 ounces Chocolate, plain</li>
      <li>3 Egg yolks</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Whisk 1/2 of the cream until stiff and spread it around the edges of a large bowl. Freeze for 1/2 to 1 hour. Dissolve the sugar in the water, bring to the boil and simmer for 3 minutes until syrupy. Meanwhile, break chocolate into blender or warm bowl. Pour the hot sugar syrup onto the chocolate and blend or whisk until the chocolate has all melted. Add the egg yolks and mix the whole lot thoroughly. Whisk the remaining cream into soft peaks and fold gently into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the centre of the frozen cream and freeze for several hours until solid. Cover when fully frozen. NOTES: * A high-cholesterol chocolate dessert -- This recipe comes from a friend's aunt. It always seems to taste wonderful no matter how sloppily I measure things. Yield: Serves 4-6. * Although the recipe "serves 4-6," two people will happily eat the whole thing. * The outside is frozen solid, so you may find a fork useful for breaking your portion into pieces without showering fellow diners with fragments. It could be served in small portions, but don't count on having any left over. * Double cream has more than 45 percent butterfat. It is difficult to find cream in North America that is richer than whipping cream, which is typically 32 percent butterfat. If you can find heavy cream it is likely to be 36 percent. Use the richest cream you can find. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 20 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooling. : Precision: no need to measure. : William Roberts : Department of Computer Science &amp; Statistics : Queen Mary College : University of London, UK : liam@qmc-cs.UUCP : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Prepare a large, nonstick pan with olive oil spray and heat on medium-high heat. Add okra, onion, bell peppers, celery, and garlic. Saute 5 minutes. Remove vegetables to a bowl. ROUX* - Add oil to saucepan and stir in flour. Saute 3 minutes, until flour turns a cocoa color. *For a roux with no fat, omit the oil and brown the flour in a dry pan, over medium heat, stirring constantly. Without oil, flour will burn. Add the 4 cups water little by little, stirring constantly until smooth. Bring to a simmer, add thyme and cayenne. Add tomatoes breaking them up with a spoon. Return vegetables to the pan and simmer 5 minutes. Add corn and lima beans. Continue to simmer 5 minutes. Turn off heat, add Worcestershire sauce, file powder and salt and pepper to taste, and let stand. Serve gumbo with Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce at the table as desired. Serve with hot cooked rice. To make RICE: Bring a large pot of water with 2 to quarts of water to boil. Add rice and boil, uncovered, about 10 minutes. Test a grain. Rice should be cooked through, but not soft. Drain rice in a colander. Run hot water through rice and stir with a fork. Add salt and pepper to taste.

    <title>Aunt Clara's Fruit Salad</title>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 can (20 ounce) chunk pineapple</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Vinegar or lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/2 pints Whipping cream or medium size container of Cool Whip; (I use Cool Whip)</li>
      <li>Fruit; bananas, seedless grapes, apples, oranges, berries*</li>
      <li>1 Bag miniature marshmellows; (may not use the whole bag, depending on preferences)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a fourth generation handed down receipe. We call it Aunt Clara's Fruit Salad because my Great-Great Aunt Clara used to bring this to family functions. *NOTE: - whatever is in season at the time. I usually put in two large bunches of green grapes, 4 large apples and 4 larger bananas plus whatever else I have on hand. Drain juice from pineapple into 2 qt saucepan and heat juice until hot; wisk in vinegar/lemon juice and coarnstarch until smooth and very thick (like pudding.) Cool mixture. Put fruit (cut up in bite sized pieces) into serving bowl/container, add marshmellows and whipped cream/Cool Whip and gently stir to coat. Refrigerate until serving time. (Can coat apple and banana pieces in a little of the lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.) Note: This is my daughters' favorite salad which I am 'required' to bring to all family functions such as Christmas and Easter get-togethers. It can make a large salad if you add lots of fruit - if I need a larger salad, I usually use a larger container of Cool Whip.

    <recipetext>
      <li>((Note: Per Horst Scharfenberg, this recipe originated in the town of Idar-Oberstein in the 19 th century, when gemstone prospectors returning from South America created their own version of gaucho-grilled steaks. The dish was then further refined by Scharfenberg's mentor August Goerg. K.B.)) Per person: thick, trimmed Mix together the shallot or onion with the pepper and mace. Insert a few shallot pieces into the steak using the point of a small knife. Coat the steak with the shallot mixture, pressing it in so it will adhere. Remove the loose shallot pieces and grill the steak (over a fire of oak logs, says August Goerg, from which the bark has been removed).* Take the steaks off the grill while they are still pink inside. Sprinkle them with salt. *Note: A special grill is used, suspended with 3 chains from an iron tripod and constantly swinging through the flames.

      <li>This is a really easy dessert, loaded with calories, and not for the faint-of-heart! Make the bisquick drop biscuits as directed on the package, BUT add 1 tb of sugar (or 2, if you like). Bake as directed. While still warm, cut in half and put the bottom half in a bowl. Cover with fresh strawberries (which you have marinated in 4 Tb sugar in the refrigerator for 2 days), add a scoop or two of French vanilla ice cream, and then top with the top layer of the biscuit. Now, cover with more strawberries and top with fresh whipped cream. Enjoy!

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cups Potatoes; peeled and finely diced</li>
      <li>2 cups Onions; peeled and finely diced</li>
      <li>1 cup Broccoli stems; peeled and finely diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Allspice</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sea salt</li>
      <li>2 cups Soysage</li>
      <li>2 cups Tofu; firm or extra firm, crushed by hand</li>
      <li>Whole wheat pie dough for two double crusted pies</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Barley malt syrup</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Saute th epotatoes, onions, broccoli and garlic for a few minutes. Add the seasonings and continue cooking for a few minutes, stirring constantly.Finally, add the soysage and tofu and cook until the mixture is hot, stirring constantly. Roll out half of the dough and prepare the bottom crust for each of two small pies. Put 3 cups of filling in each pie pan. Roll out the top crusts and place them over the pies. Seal the edges of the top and bottom crusts, wetting the edges first with water. Bake in apreheated oven at 400 degrees for 40 mintues or until th etop crusts are browned. When the pie has baked for about 30 minutes, you can glaze the top crust with amixture of 1/4 cup barley malt syrup and 2 tbs water. Just lightly glaze the crust and return the pie to the oven. The glaze will make the crust shiny and brown. Variation: You may prefer to add a bread crumb topping to the pie instead of a top crust. Prepare the topping by lightly mixing 1/2 cup whole wheat bread crumbs and 1/4 cup oil. Sprinkle it over the pie filling and bake the pie acording to the recipe. Source: Friendly Foods by Bro.

      <li>1 cup All-purpose flour</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Source: Roberta Brisson - This recipe is from my dad's sister. It's also a very old recipe. Mix eggs, salt, flour and whiskey to make a stiff dough working it into a smooth dough. On a lightly floured board, roll dough very thin (almost paper thin). Cut into the size of a 3-inch square and make 2 slits in the center with a sharpe knife. This is a very stiff and sticky dough. Deep fry in lard (350 degrees) for 2 to 3 seconds. Fry only a couple at a time. Remove from fat and drain on paper toweling. Dust generously with confectioners' sugar when cooled. NOTE: This is the only recipe I don't substitute the lard. It gives the pastry a better taste that oil. My father also said that these were like eating air. (Too bad that they don't have the calories of air.) It was one of his favorites. Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 635 by QueenBerta@aol.com on Jan 29, 1998</li>

    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 medium Potatoes; cubed</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Margarine</li>
      <li>1 medium Onion; shredded</li>
      <li>1 can Tomatoes; small, chopped</li>
      <li>2 large Beets (or 3 small)</li>
      <li>1/2 small Cabbage; finely shredded</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh parsley; minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Dried basil; Rubbed To Powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Dried Oregano; Rubbed To Powder</li>
      <li>3 Sour Leaves Or Juice Of 1/2 Lemon, * See Note</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Sour leaves are interchangeable with sorrel leaves. Put the cubed potatoes into 3 litres (12 cups) of water in a pot and bring to a boil. Melt the margarine in a frying pan and sauté the onion until it is brown. Add the tomatoes. Cook the beets, peel and then julienne. (Leave the root and 2-3" of stem on the beets or the color will 'bleed' from the beets before they get into your borscht.) Add to potatoes and bring to a boil. Add tomatoes and onions to the potatoes and beets and simmer. Add cabbage. Add the parsley, basil, oregano and sour leaves or lemon juice. Options: Simmer pork bones in water, remove bones and scum, add potatoes and beets. Add garlic to tomato/onion. Add lentils or small navy beans - can be added the second day. Serve hot or cold with sour cream. Aunty Eloise says that there are many different kinds of borscht. You make lighter ones in the summer and richer heavier ones in the winter. Once, while on vacation in Los Angeles, I was talking about borscht to a nice American lady of German descent. She said that her family's borscht didn't use any beets or sour leaves but that it did use sour salt. I had never seen or heard of such a thing but when I searched a local (LA) supermarket I had no trouble finding it. However, since then, I have not seen that ingredient in a local (MA) store or seen a recipe using it.

      <li>Prepare and bake the crust.</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>To make the filling, combine 2 cups milk, sugar and salt in a nonreactive saucepan; whisk once to mix and bring to a boil over low heat. Place remaining 1/2 cup milk in a mixing bowl and whisk in cornstarch, then eggs. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil over low heat then whisk about a third of it into the egg mixture. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk in the egg mixture, whisking constantly until the filling thickens and comes to a boil. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, whisk in butter and vanilla; pour into a nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of the filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees. Fold the bananas into the cooled filling and spread it evenly in the cooled crust. To finish the pie, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla until it holds a firm peak. Use a hand mixer on medium speed or a heavyduty mixer fitted with the whisk. Spread the cream over the filling, making sure it touches the edges of the crust all around. COCONUT CREAM PIE: For the 2/3 cup sugar in the filling substitute 1/3 cup sugar. Substitute 1/2 cup coconut cream, such as Coco Lopez, for the 1/2 cup milk with which the cornstarch is mixed. After the filling has cooled, fold in 1/2 cup toastedsweetened coconut. After covering the pie with the whipped cream, (you may add up to 1/4 cup coconut cream to the cream before whipping it to replace the sugar) sprinkle the whipped cream with 1/2 cup toasted sweetened coconut. (To toast coconut, place it on a jelly roll pan on the middle rack of a preheated 325 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Stir often so that the coconut colors evenly to a light golden brown.)

      <li>Beat these ingredients together for 4 minutes. Line 1 jelly roll pan with waxed paper that's been greased. Grease and flour another jelly roll pan. Put half of batter in each pan. Bake 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Filling: Whip these 2 ingredients together. Add 1 tsp banana extract and whip again. Add 2 C Powdered Sugar and 1 T milk and whip until fluffy. Add 2 more C Powdered Sugar and if the mixture is to thick, add a small amount of milk to make fluffy and spreadable. Take 1 cake, add filling into center, put 2nd cake on top. Let set and then cut into bars, however long or short, fat or thin you want them. Wrap each separately and either put into refridgerator or in freezer to use at a later date. I usually make 2 sets of bars. One to freeze and one to eat. My daycare kids call them their 'cool treats'. I think your family will like them too!

      <li>By cooking the filling in the microwave, you eliminate the need for constant stirring and reduce the chance of scorching. Approx. 4 hours to chill 1. Lightly spray a 9-inch glass pie plate with vegetable cooking spray. 2. Crust: Cut the 1/3 cup butter in small pieces into a medium-size microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 15 to 18 seconds until soft but not melted. Add cookie crumbs and stir with a fork until blended. Press firmly and evenly over bottom and up sides of prepared pie plate. Microwave on medium 2 to 2 /12 minutes, rotating dish 1/2 turn once, until crust is set. Let cool before filling. 3. Filling: Mix sugar and cornstarch in a 2-quart, microwave-safe bowl. Gradually whisk in milk, then egg yolks until well blended. Microwave uncovered on high 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 minutes, stirring once, until mixture starts to rise around edges. Continue cooking on high 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, stirring once, until filling starts to thicken. Whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons butter and the vanilla until custard has a pudding consistency. Place plastic wrap directly on custard to prevent skin from forming. Refrigerate 1 hour or until cool. 4. To assemble: peel bananas, quarter lengthwise and cut crosswise on 1/2-inch pieces. Mix with 1 cup of the cooled custard. Spread over bottom of crust. Spread remaining custard on top. Refrigerate 3 hours or up to 1 day (bananas will darken slightly). 5. Topping: beat cream with electric mixer until slightly thickened. Beat in sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form when beaters are lifted. 6. Drop dollops of cream around edges of pie. Arrange sliced banana, strawberries and almonds, and drizzle with caramel topping.

      <li>Slice and dry full grown bananas. Use only the fruit that is full grown as green bananas contain too much starch. After drying, grind or pound in a mortar, then pass the powder through a sieve. This flour can be used in equal parts with regular flour in making desserts where a starchy substance is used.

Don't recall where I got the original, but have modified it quite a bit, so it is pretty much my own. I use it if I happen to have some grossly over ripe bananas on hand, and if not, try to go to a grocery which has a mark down produce section for them. The key to really good banana flavor is using very, very ripe bananas. If it is almost black, mushy and oozing juice, it is perfect for the bread. Enjoy!</li>

The url for this site is: http://www.pathfinder.com/@@4SwYyQYA8y8sh9H1/cl/search.html 1 Combine first 3 ingredients in a small bowl; stir well. Add 1 tablespoon of egg white (discard remaining egg white) and 1 tablespoon melted margarine; toss with a fork until moistened. Press into bottom and up sides of a 9-inch pie plate coated with cooking spray. Bake at 325 degrees for 20 minutes; let cool on a wire rack. 2 Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, salt, and egg in a large bowl; stir well with a wire whisk, and set aside. 3 Heat milk over medium-high heat in a medium heavy saucepan to 180 degrees or until tiny bubbles form around edge (do not boil). Remove from heat. Gradually add hot milk to sugar mixture, stirring constantly with whisk. Return milk mixture to pan. Add 1 tablespoon margarine, and cook over medium heat 4 minutes or until thickened and bubbly, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low, and cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Place pan in a large ice-filled bowl for 25 minutes or until egg mixture cools to room temperature, stirring occasionally. 4 Remove pan from ice. Fold in the sliced banana, and spoon mixture into prepared crust. Spread whipped topping evenly over filling, and top with chocolate curls. Cover loosely, and chill 4 hours.

      <li>CAKE: 1. Preheat oven to 350^ F. Grease two 9" x 1 1/2" round cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment or wax paper. Grease again and flour. 2. In a food processor puree the bananas. Blend in the yogurt. Add the eggs and vanilla and pulse a few seconds to combine. Set aside. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium mixing bowl. 3. In a large mixing bowl cream the butter with an electric mixer until smooth and light. Add 1/2 the banana mixture and all the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed two minutes until light and fluffy. Add the rest of the wet mixture and beat on high speed for one minute. Fold in grated chocolate. 4. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, which should be half full. Bake for 30-32 minutes or just until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Run a small, metal spatula around the sides, then unmold and peel off the paper lining. Cool the cake to room temperature before assembling. FROSTING: 1. Heat cream and chocolate in a heave saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally to melt and blend the chocolate. Remove from the heat, stir in the powdered espresso, then pour into a clean dry container. Once the cream reaches room temperture, cover directly with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Chill in the freezer until very cold, about 1 hour, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. 2. Once the cake has cooled to room temperature, beat the ganache (do not use a whisk beater) on medium-low speed to soft peaks. Increase to high speed and continue beating until the frosting reaches a thick spreading consistency. Spread the frosting immediately, while it is smooth. 3. Frost as desired for a festive look: spread 3/4 cup of frosting between the layers and another 3/4 cup on top. Mask the sides with a very thin layer. With a pastry bag fitted with a large open star tip pipe a continuous vertical pattern all around the sides. Pipe stars around the top of the cake. Finished, the cake keeps refrigerated up to 3 days. For best results slice the cake chilled, but let sit 1/2 hour at room temperature before serving.
