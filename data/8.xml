    <ingredient>
      <li>4 cups Chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Plus 2 teaspoons nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>

      <li>6 Shallots, chopped</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves, chopped</li>
      <li>8 Ounces lump crab meat, picked over and drained</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cornstarch or arrowroot, mixed with</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cold water</li>
      <li>1 Egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>15 ounces White asparagus spears *</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Shredded coriander</li>
      <li>1 Scallion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* cut into 1-inch sections with canning liquid reserved This soup was probably created by some homesick Frenchman. White asparagus (a French import), packed in jars or cans, is used for this recipe. Traditionally, crumbled, salted duck egg yolk is added to season the soup. If white asparagus is unavailable, use frozen or fresh asparagus (in this case, add the fresh asparagus to the broth from the very beginning and cook until tender, before adding the remaining ingredients). Combine the broth, 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce, the sugar and salt in a 3 quart soup pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet. Add the shallots and garlic and stir-fry until aromatic. Add the crab meat, the remaining 2 teaspoons fish sauce and black pepper to taste. Stirfry over high heat for 1 minute. Set aside. Bring the soup to a boil. Add the cornstarch mixture and stir gently until the soup thickens and is clear. While the soup is actively boiling, add the egg and stir gently. Continue to stir for about 1 minute. Add the crab meat mixture and asparagus with its canning liquid; cook gently until heated through. Transfer the soup to a heated tureen. Sprinkle on the coriander, scallion and freshly ground black pepper. Yield: 4 to 6 servings. From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang. 1989.

    <title>Asparagus and Mushroom Sauce with Caramelized Shallots</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>2</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Medium asparagus; tough ends snapped off spears halved lengthwise then cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 large Shallots; thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Button mushrooms; or cremini mushrooms brushed clean and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Bring 1 inch of water to boil in large pot. Put asparagus in steamer basket, then carefully place steamer basket in pot. Cover and steam over medium-high heat until asparagus is just tender, about 2 minutes. Remove asparagus and set aside. Reserve 1 cup of the asparagus steaming liquid. 2. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots- saute, stirring occasionally to separate rings, until crisp and light brown, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms, increase heat to medium-high, and saut6 until they soften and release their juices, about 5 minutes longer. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper or to taste. 3. Add asparagus and reserved cooking liquid. Simmer until asparagus is heated through and sauce has thickened a bit, about 2 minutes longer. Adjust seasonings. Cook's Illustrated, Mar./Apr. 1995, Page 11. Credit: Jack Bishop. Nationality: Italian Course: pasta sauce Season: spring Methods: steamed, sauted, boiled, stirred and simmered Start to Finish 30 minutes Preparation 5 minutes Attention 20 minutes Finishing a minute or less NOTES : Enough for 1 pound of pasta. If pencil thin asparagus are available, they don't need to be halved, but thicker asparagus should be sliced in half, and very thick pieces need to be quartered. You may add 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese when you toss the sauce with pasta, preferably linguine, then offer extra Parmesan at the table. Recipe by: Cook's Illustrated, Mar./Apr. 1995, Page 11.

      <li>8 ounces Pastry *</li>

      <li>8 ounces Asparagus; peeled &amp; cooked</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>NB* As usual, the weight of pastry is the weight of flour used to make it. Roll out the pastry and line a 9" flan ring. Bake blind as usual at a high temperature (400 for 8-9 mins weighted down then a futher 2-3 mins just to colour lightly). Meanwhile, mash the cheeses together, put into a measuring jug and make up to volume with cream or cream and milk. Beat hard with the eggs (food processor). Season to taste with salt, pepper and cayenne as usual. The asparagus should have been peeled/trimmed as usual and boiled in strongly salted water until just tender - for really freshly picked asparagus &lt;15 minutes will suffice. Immediately remove from water and separate on a paper towel to cool quickly. When cold, cut into 2" lengths and spread out on the flan base. Pour over the custard and bake in a moderate oven (375F) for around 30 minutes until nicely set. Serve warm (not cold or too hot).

Slice the beef against the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices; toss with the beef marinade. Set aside for 10 minutes. Preheat a wok until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Over high heat, add beef and stir-fry for a minute or until seared; remove and set aside. While wok is hot, add remaining oil, salt and reserved black-bean paste; stir-fry until fragrant, a few seconds. Toss in the onions, stir-fry for 10 seconds, then add the asparagus in 2-or-3 batches, seconds apart, making certain the wok is hot before adding the next batch. Toss and stir until asparagus are coated with the oil. Sprinkle with soy sauce, toss together, then pour in the stock and bring to a boil. If the asparagus needs more cooking, cover for a minute. Meanwhile, stir the cornstarch, water, sugar and oyster sauce into a smooth paste. When the asparagus is tender but still crisp, add the cornstarch liquid into the center of the wok. Immediately stir until thickened, about 10 seconds. Return the beef, add a desh of sesame oil; toss to mix. Serve hot over rice.

      <li>2 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>

      <li>CUT OFF THE TOUGH BOTTOM END of the asparagus and discard. Peel the stalks with a vegetable peeler. Place asparagus in a skillet or saucepan just large enough to hold them lying down and barely cover with cold water. Add butter and salt and bring to a boil, uncovered, over high heat. Stir the asparagus so it will cook evenly. The asparagus is done when the water has evaporated, leaving only the concentrated, buttery juice of the asparagus. Grind fresh pepper to taste over the asparagus and arrange on a vegetable platter. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Thin asparagus, unpeeled, ends trimmed</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>9 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Freshly grated Parmigiano- Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut asparagus into 1 1/2" to 2" lengths, reserving tips. Melt butter over medium heat in non-stick, 9" saute pan. Add asparagus stems, not tips, and cook, stirring occasionally, until stems begin to soften, about 5 minutes. In mixing bowl, lightly beat eggs with water and 2 tablespoons cheese. Eggs should lighten slightly but should not foam. Add asparagus tips and stir well. Add egg mixture to saute pan. Cook 1 minute, then begin forming frittata, pushing sides of egg mixture into center, allowing liquid eggs to come in contact with pan. Continue pushing, without stirring, until eggs on bottom are solid and just beginning to brown, about 3-4 minutes. Cover with lid and cook last minute, to set top of eggs. Place dinner plate directly over saute pan and firmly holding plate and pan together, invert, so eggs come out onto plate. Remove pan from plate, return pan to heat and slide eggs back into pan so that eggs are now upside-down. Cook another 1-2 minutes, depending on how runny or firm you want the frittata to be. Alternatively, place pan (oven-proof only) under broiler and cook just long enough to puff top and brown lightly. Slide frittata out onto clean plate. Dust top with remaining 2 tablespoons cheese. Season lightly to taste with salt.

      <li>From: "Wendy Lockman" &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt; Date: Thu, 9 May 1996 19:06:51 +0000 The French introduced asparagus to the Vietnamese, who promptly incorporated this classic vegetable into their cuisine. The Vietnamese word for asparagus is "Western bamboo," due to its resemblance to bamboo shoots. asparagus is universally popular throughout Vietnam, this light, tasty dish will delight your family as well. Bring water to a boil and put the pork bones in. Remove the scum, then cover and continue to boil the bones for 1 hour. Remove the bones from the stock and discard. Add the salt and the fish sauce to the stock. Heat the oil and add the chopped garlic and shallots; add the crab meat and fry for 5 minutes over high heat. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper, stirring constantly, then add the crab meat mixture to the soup and bring to a boil. Add the cornstarch-and-water mixture and stir for a few minutes. Break the egg open and drop it into the actively boiling soup while stirring. Cook, still stirring, for about 2 minutes, then drop in the asparagus, along with the liquid from the can and the rest of the black pepper. Continue to cook until the asparagus is heated through. Sprinkle the coriander and scallion green over the soup before serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings. From "The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam", Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman, Barron's, 1979.

      <li>1. Place asparagus and broth into 4 qt pan and simmer for 15 min., until tender. 2. Puree asparagus/broth in blender. Take out some pieces for a chunkier consistency if you wish. 3. Put puree back in pan and add red pepper, any reserved asparagus, black pepper, and can of milk. 4. Heat until thickened to your liking. NOTE: You can add some thickener(flour,cornstarch) to hasten the process. I started the pepper roasting at about the same time as the the asparagus, and it worked out fine to add to soup. Serve with a salad and hearty bread! Posted by mmk3@Lehigh.EDU (MARGARET M.

Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rinse until puffy, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cut each loaf crosswise into 9 equal pieces. Pick up the ends of each piece, and stretch it to the length of a 12x15" greased baking sheet and set on pan; if dough snaps back, let rest a few minutes, then stretch again. Repeat to make each stick, spacing about 1 1/2" apart. With scissors at a 45' angle, snip dough to make cuts about 1/2" apart along about 4" of 1 end of each stick. Beat egg white until slightly frothy; brush dough lightly with egg white. Mix cheese, tarragon, and dill. Sprinkle evenly over dough. Bake in a 350' oven until breadsticks are browned, 20-25 minutes. (If using 1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking; chill remaining pans of dough until oven is free.) Transfer breadsticks to racks. Serve warm or cool. If you make sticks ahead, let cool, package airtight, and hold up to 4 hours, or freeze. To recrisp, bake breadsticks (thawed, if frozen), uncovered, on pans in a 350' oven until warm, about 5 minutes. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Asparagus (6 to 8 medium spears per person)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut away the lower 4th of the asparagus and peel the stalk. This way the entire spear is edible will cook more quickly and at the same rate. Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a casserole or skillet large enough to accommodate the asparagus in one single flat layer. Add the asparagus to the water, cover and quickly bring the water back to a boil. Uncover the skillet and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes or until the asparagus are just tender. They should be just cooked through but still with some crunch left it. Serving suggestions: For 1 pound asparagus, melt 4 tablespoons butter and mash in 2 hard boiled eggs.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Asparagus</li>
      <li>2 Spring bulb onions; (about 1/2 pound)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound Buckwheat linguine</li>
      <li>3 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 cup Vegetable stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped chervil; plus</li>
      <li>20 Sprigs chervil; for garnish</li>
      <li>1/2 Lemon</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Ricotta salata cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Snap off the ends of the asparagus and peel if the stalks are thick. Slice diagonally 1/4 inch thick, leaving the tips whole. Trim and peel the spring onions and slice them very thin. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. In a pan big enough for the vegetables to be sauteed, not steamed, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the asparagus and the spring onions, season with salt and pepper, and saute over high heat for a few minutes, until the vegetables are slightly browned and caramelized. Cook the linguine. When the vegetables are nearly done, add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. When the vegetables are ready, pour in the vegetable stock to deglaze the pan; add the rest of the butter off the heat, swirling the pan to thicken the sauce. Add the chopped chervil and a squeeze of lemon. Taste for salt, pepper, and lemon juice, and adjust if necessary. Drain the linguine, add to the vegetables, and toss. Serve immediately on warm plates, garnished with crumbled ricotta salata and the chervil sprigs. Serves 4 to 6. &gt;From: Pat Hanneman &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; 23-Dec-97 REF: http://www.onlinechef.com/chez.recvege.html BOOK REVIEW: Recipes and contents from Alice Waters' newest cookbook, Chez Panisse Vegetables, (HarperCollins Press).

    <recipetext>
      <li>** See recipe for Puff Pastry. For the pastry cornets: ======================= Roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface to 3" x 20" rectangle, 1/4" thick. Cut the rectangle into 4 long strips, each 3/4" wide. Wrap each strip around a long metal cone (which can be made from heavy-duty aluminum foil), beginning at the tip and rolling the strip around and around, overlapping slightly. Place these on an ungreased baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour or more. Preheat oven to 375 F. Bake pastry cornets until golden, about 15 minutes. Cool briefly, then very carefully the metal or foil cones. For the lemon dressing: ======================= Combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice, and salt and pepper. Whisk in the oil a drop at a time. When the dressing begins to thicken, add the oil 1 teaspoon at a time, then continue adding oil in a thin stream. Adjust seasonings to taste. Cook the asparagus, tied in bundles, in boiling salted water until it's just crisp-tender; drain. Construction: ============= Pour a small amount of dressing on each serving plate. Place a cornet on top of the dressing and tuck the asparagus into the ends of the cornet, fanning the tips outward.

      <li>1/2 pints Strong hot tea</li>
      <li>10 ounces Self-raising flour</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is Wales' traditional rich fruit bread. South Wales makes it with baking powder; Northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent. Either way it's delicious. Soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea. You can use either fresh tea, or the cold dregs from the teapot (this gives a good strong colour). Next day, sieve the flour and fold it it into the fruit. Mix in the lightly beaten egg. Line a small loaf-tin with buttered paper then tip in the mixture, smoothing it well into the corners. Bake in a gentle oven at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours. Cool and store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist and rich. Traditionalists say you should never butter the Bara Brith, but Dorothy says do, as it's lovely that way. Source: Elisabeth Luard in "Country Living" (British), April 1989.

Add the yoghurt, cream and ground almonds and when it starts to simmer turn the heat down and stir-fry for 10 minutes more to ensure it does not stick, adding milk or water as necessary. 5. Place saffron strands in a little warm water and extract as much color as you can by gently mashing with a teaspoon. 6. Check that the chicken is cooked right through by cutting a large piece across. Simmer on if required. Just prior to serving add the saffron and salt to taste. Garnish with the coriander and almonds, and serve immediatley.</li>

      <li>In a saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, chiles, and garlic, and saut‚ over medium heat until everything is softened. Mix in the remaining ingredients and bring the sauce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 35 to 40 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool briefly. Strain the sauce and puree the solids in a food processor. Return the pureed mixture to the sauce, stirring thoroughly. Refrigerate the sauce overnight to allow the flavors to mingle and mellow. Use the sauce warm or chilled. It keeps for weeks. * Variation: If you prefer a thinner sauce, water this down to your preferred consistency. It will still pack plenty of pizzazz. ~ SOURCE: SMOKE AND SPICE Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #232 by Michael McLaughlin &lt;mmclaughlin@micronet.net&gt; on Sep 01, 1997</li>

      <li>This month, we're delighted to bring you a quick and easy recipe for bannock, from James' latest cookbook, Peasant's Alphabet. Bannock is a non-rising bread that goes back to the days of the trappers, hunters and covered wagon pioneers. They all made bannock at the end of a long day when they were cold, tired and hungry. Serve this delicious bread on a cold winter's night, alongside a steaming pot of chili or a big hearty stew. You may want to recruit the youngsters into helping you. After all, it's a great introduction to cooking andit's just messy enough to make it enjoyable. Next time you're baking -- whether you're using a conventional oven, a barbecue or even an open fire -- try out this recipe for bannock. MIX the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar together in a bowl. ADD the oil and milk (or water), stirring until you have a stiff batter. DUST your hands with the flour and press the batter into a flat cake about 1/2 an inch / 1.25 cm thick. POKE a hole in the middle (so it looks like a big donut). HEAT a lightly greased frying pan over high heat for 1 minute, then turn it to low. PLACE the bannock in the pan, cover and cook for 5 minutes. FLIP, cook for 5 more minutes and then cook a further 10 minutes on each side (cook about 35 minutes altogether). EAT immediately with lots of butter and jam or peanut butter.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>corn or flour tortillas Before you actually get the cabeza (beef head), understand that it won't look very nice -in fact it will look pretty gruesome. Therefore, I suggest purchasing the thing the day you cook it. In the Rio Grande Valley, barbacoa de cabeza is traditionally eaten on Sunday mornings. Clean the cabeza, removing eyes, ears, etc. Discard the tongue. Leaving it will impart an odd taste to the meat. Wrap the cabeza in a paper sack, along with onions, garlic, and cilantro. Wrap THAT in burlap. Dig a hole 2 feet deep and build a driftwood fire in it. Wait until the fire goes to coals, then cover them with ashes, followed by the cabeza, then about 2 inches of dry dirt or sand. Fill up the hole. Add 6 to 8 inches of dirt or sand over it. Build a fire on top of the ground. Use slow-burining wood such as oak or mesquite. Leave the cabeza in the hole 12 to 18 hours. For example, if you begin cooking it at 4:00 p.m., it should be ready by the next morning. Serve with tortillas. Serves one vanload. If you want to try barbacoa de cabeza at homne, try wrapping the cabeza in foil and bakinng it in an oven or over a charcoal grill. Using foil in place of the paper bag keeps the cabeza slightly moister while Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #271 Date: Thu, 03 Oct 1996 19:31:11 -0700 From: jessann doe &lt;jessann@texas.net&gt;</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Slice 2 of the onions into 1/4 inch slices. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a frying pan. Add the sliced onion, and cook, stirring, until the outside has browned. Remove and drain. Slice the remaining onion into paper-thin slices and set aside. Rinse the bones and place in a stockpot. Cover with cold water. Bring slowly to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered. For a clear broth skim off foam. After 10 - 15 minutes, add browned onion and ginger, carrots, cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, cloves, garlic and peppercorns. Bring to a boil. Simmer the stock, partially covered for 6 to 12 hours, skimming regularly. If necessary add more water to keep the bones covered. Strain the stock, skim off, and discard any fat. At serving time, arrange the sliced beef on a platter. Garnish with reserved white and green onion. On another platter, arrange the bean sprouts, coriander, chiles and limes. Meanwhile, plunge the rice sticks in boiling water to heat. Drain. Place equal portions in each soup bowl. Cover to keep warm. Heat beef stock to boiling. Season with fish sauce and pepper. Pour into a soup tureen or chafing dish. At the table, place the soup on a portable warmer to keep hot. Offer each guest a bowl of warm rice noodles. Each diner adds some beef and onion to a bowl. Ladle the hot stock over the meat, stirring to cook the meat. Add the bean sprouts, coriander, chiles, and lime to taste. Enjoy with chopsticks and a soup spoon. Optional: pass fresh basil leaves, coriander, additional chilies, fish sauce and ground peanuts at the table.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: BARB DAY</li>
      <li>4 slices Bacon; diced</li>
      <li>1 large Onion; diced (See note)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Cabbage; chopped</li>
      <li>12 ounces Chicken broth</li>
      <li>3 large Potatoes; peeled, diced Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup Egg noodles</li>
      <li>2 cups Milk</li>
      <li>1 cup Heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Note: I like to prepare onion by placing it in a covered vessel and placing it in the microwave on high, (skin on) for about 5 minutes. When the onion is done, the skin can be slipped off easily, and the onion chopped. This is equivalent to sauteeing to the point where the onion is translucent, but for this dish the onion still needs to be sauteed. Using this method cuts out the tears and most of the odor, not to mention, no use of fat! Cook the bacon in the butter until it is lightly browned, then add the onion and cook for a few minutes, until the onion just begins to brown. Add the cabbage, and cook until it is very limp. Now add the diced potatoes, and chicken stock. Salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender. Add the noodles on top of the mixture, and cover again. Cook for about 6 to eight minutes, or until the noodles are almost done. Add the milk and cream, and the 2 tablespoons of butter, and correct seasonings. Stir and cover the pan again. Cook over low heat just until warmed through. Serving Note: You might like a little crisp fried, crumbled bacon and/or chopped chives or green onion tops as a tasty garnish.

    <category>Bread</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups All purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Rolled oats</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar, granulated</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder Salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Raisins; optional Water; approx,</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"Bannock, a simple type of scone was cooked in pioneer days over open fires. Variations in flours and the additional of dried or fresh fruit make this bread the simple choice of Canadian campers even today. Oven baking has become an acceptable alternative to the cast iron frypan. McKelvie's restaurant in Halifax serves an oatmeal version similar to this one. For plain bannock, omit rolled oats and increase the all purpose flour to 1 cup.... One of the earliest quick breads, bannock was as simple as flour, salt, a bit of fat (often bacon grease) and water. In gold rush days, dough was mixed right in the prospector's flour bag and cooked in a frypan over an open fire. Indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground beside their camp fire, baking it along with freshly caught fish. Today's native _Fried Bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet. Newfoundlander's _Damper Dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on the stove's dampers while _Toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep fried. At a promotional luncheon for the 1992 Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Eskimo Doughnuts, deep fried rings of bannock dough, were served. It is said that Inuit children prefer these "doughnuts" to sweet cookies. Red River settlers from Scotland made a frugal bannock with lots of flour, little sugar and drippings or lard. Now this same bread plays a prominent part in Winnipeg's own Folklorama Festival. At Expo '86 in Vancouver, buffalo on bannock buns was a popular item at the North West Territories ' restaurant. In many regions of Canada, whole wheat flour or wheat germ replaces part of the flour and cranberries or blueberries are sometimes added. A Saskatchewan firm markets a bannock mix, and recipe books from coast to coast upgrade bannock with butter, oatmeal, raisins, cornmeal and dried fruit." Stir together flours, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add melted butter, raisins (if using) and water, adding more water if needed to make sticky dough. With floured hands, pat into greased pie plate. Bake in 400F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tester comes out clean. Cut into wedges. SERVES:6 VARIATIONS: In place of raisins add chopped dried apricots or fresh berries.(Blueberries are terrific if one is camping in northern Ontario in August.)

Cut the lettuce leaves into shreds and place on a serving dish. Arrange the chicken shreds on top. Mix the sauce ingredients with a few tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid.* Pour evenly over the chicken. Toss the ingedients just before serving, or at the table. * I would let the chicken stock continue to simmer and reduce, then use the concentrated stock.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe By: MARK HIX, LE CAPRICE, LONDON, ENGLAND To make the sauce, put the peanut butter into a bowl and place over boiling water for 10 minutes to soften. Remove from the heat and whisk in the chilli sauce and sugar. Gradually, add both the oils until the sauce is the right consistency for pouring - depending on the peanut butter, you may not need all the oil. Poach the chicken breasts for about 10 minutes (until cooked through) in the stock, then drain and cool. Then cut into 1 inch shreds and put to one side. Peel the carrot and cut into shreds, also about 1 inch long, then cut the spring onions to the same size, using the green and the white. Cut the cucumber into 1 inch lengths, leaving the skin on. Thinly slice lengthways and cut into matchstick shapes, discarding the seeds. Arrange the vegetables on a serving dish and pile the chicken on top. Then pour the sauce generously over the chicken and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. NOTES : Published in Sainsbury's The Magazine April 1996 EAT-L Digest 9 July 96 From the EAT-L recipe list.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Wed, 3 Apr 1996 00:31:19 -0500 From: BobbieB1@aol.com For the dough: Put the water in a mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Stir until the yeast has dissolved. Beat the egg into the yeast mixture, and set aside. Sift together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture. Knead until the mix forms a ball- if too moist add a bit more flour. Knead 10 minutes more. Roll out to an 11" square. Spread 1/2 cup butter over the surface of the dough. Fold the dough into thirds and wrap in a damp cloth. Refrigerate 20 minutes. Repeat this process beginning from rolling out the dough, two more times. While the dough is in the refrigerator the last time, you should prepare the fillings, icings or other recipes you will need for the finished pastries. The following parts will give you the variety of pastries made with this dough, and the methods. They will be followed by additional recipes needed to prepare the pastries. Source: Vera Stevens (my mother) INSTRUCTIONS FOR WEINERBROD: Place the dough on a lightly floured board and cut it in half. Roll each piece into 24" X 6" strip. Spread the surface with Almond butter. Fold the edges lengthwise toward the center, allowing 1" space in the center. Sprinkle the plumped currants and spoon the Vanilla Cream into the 1" space between the edges. Repeat with second strip. Place both lengths of dough on a baking sheet and shape strips together like a giant pretzel, tucking in the ends. Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle with almonds. Allow the dough to rise 1 hour in a cool room. When light, bake 35 minutes in a 375 degree F. oven. (or, if making small pastries, 10-12 minutes) Cool and ice. Cut in 3" pieces. This makes 1 large pastry or 24 small ones. See later parts for necessary fillings and icings. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPANDAUER: Requires Your favorite jelly. Place the dough on a floured board and cut it in half. Roll each half 1/4" thick Cut into 4" squares. Spread Almond butter on each square. Sprinkle plumped currants or raisins on top. Fold corners to center. Put a bit of your favorite jelly in the center. Spoon Vanilla Cream in center. Place 2" apart on baking sheet. Brush with egg wash. Let rise till puffy. Brush again with the egg wash. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10-12 minutes. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SNAILS: Place dough on a lightly floured board and roll into a large rectangle 1/4" thick. Spread with almond butter and plumped currants or raisins. Roll jelly roll style. Cut into 1" slices and place slices 2" apart on baking sheet, cut side down. Spoon Vanilla cream in the center of each. Let rise until light. Bake 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees F. Ice and sprinkle with almonds.

      <li>4 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Crisco (you could use bear grease or oolichan grease.)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water to make thick dough</li>
      <li>Additional shortening to grease the pan</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The name of this dish, one which I believe comes from Scotland and therefore is not the proper Indian name at all, refers to the fact that the bread is turned. This bread has a nice flavor and it is not complicated to make. Mix the dry ingredients together well. Cut in the shortening using a pastry blender. Mix in the water and knead until the dough is very smooth, about 15 minutes. You can do this in much less time with a powerful electric mixer such as a KitchenAid. Grease a black frying pan, including the sides, and press the dough into the pan. Bake on top of the stove over low heat. Watch carefully so that the bread does not brown or burn before the center is cooked. When the bread is free from the pan, turn the loaf over and continue to cook. The total cooking time will be about l0 minutes on each side. From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <title>Barb's Peanut Brittle</title>
    <category>Candy</category>
    <quantity>48</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Hot water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Light corn syrup</li>
      <li>2 3/4 cups Raw spanish peanuts (make sure these are raw)</li>
      <li>1 ounce Butter (1" x 1" cube)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla (use real vanilla; not extract)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe takes quite a lot of counter space. Start by taking four cookie sheets and buttering them. Around each cookie sheet, spread aluminum foil (need about 4 square feet around each cookie sheet). In a heavy bottomed sauce pan, add the sugar, water, and corn syrup. Make sure not to get any on the sides of the pan. Heat on low until everything becomes liquid, then turn heat up to medium. Insert candy thermometer, and boil mixture until it reaches 240 degrees F. Slowly, add the peanuts. The mixture should NOT stop boiling. Continue heating until the mixture reaches 310 degrees F. Remove the pan from the stove. Toss in the cube of butter. Mix the soda, salt and vanilla, and pour them into the mixture. Mix it all up using a wooden spoon. Pour the mixture onto the 4 buttered cookie sheets. Get you fingers REAL buttery. As the peanut brittle cools along the edges, pull it out into thin strings. It usually takes two people to keep up with it. As soon as everything has cooled down, store the Peanut brittle in a sealed container. It is very hydrophillic and will stick together if you let it sit out.

      <li>Toast the almonds in a shallow pan in a preheated 350- degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly colored, shaking the pan once or twice. You can tell when they are done by the strong smell of toasted almonds when you open the oven door. Set asid e to cool. Cut or break the chocolate into small pieces and place it in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Let stand. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa and sugar. Add about 1 cup of the flour mixture to the chocolate. Process for about 30 seconds, or until the chocolate is fine and powdery. In a large bowl, mix together the processed ingredients with the remaining sifted dry ingredients. Stir in the almonds. In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the vanilla just to mix. With a large rubber or wooden spatula stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients. You may think there is Now place two 20-inch lengths of plastic wrap on the work surface. To shape two loaves, spoon a strip of the dough down the middle of each piece of plastic wrap. Each strip should be 13 to 14 inches long. Flatten the tops. Lift the two long sides of the plastic wrap (hold them together as close as hands, press on the plastic wrap to smooth the dough and shape it into an even strip 14 to 15 inches long, 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide and 3/4 inch thick (no thicker), with squared ends. If the strips of dough are t hicker than they should be, the baked strips will not slice neatly. Transfer to a cookie sheet and place in the freezer for about 2 hours (or as much longer as you wish), until firm enough to retain the log shape when the plastic wrap is removed. To bake, adjust two racks to divide the oven into thirds. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with baking parchment or aluminum foil, shiny-side up. To transfer the frozen dough to the sheets (the dough may still be a bit sticky; if so, it is okay ), open the two long sides of plastic wrap on top of one strip of dough and turn the dough upside down on the lined sheet, placing it diagonally on the sheet. Slowly peel off the plastic wrap. Repeat with the second strip and the second sheet. Bake the strips in the preheated oven for 1 hour, reversing the sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking to ensure even baking. During baking the strips will spread out (7 to 8 inches wide). After 1 hour of baking, reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees and remove the sheets from the oven. Immediately, with a wide metal spatula, release a strip from the parchment or foil and place it on a board. Repeat with the second strip. Use a pot holder or a folded towel to hold one of the hot strips in place, and use a serrated French bread knife to cut the strip crosswise into slices 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide. Repeat with the second strip. Place the slices, standing upright, on unlined cookie sheets with a little space between them. Return to oven to bake at 275 degrees for 40 minutes, reversing the sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking. Let cool and store in an airtight container.

      <li>1 ounce Fresh yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Demerara sugar</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Oven: 450F, Gas Mark 8 for 15 minutes: 375F, Gas Mark 5 for 45 minutes. Soak the fruit and candied peel in the water with the spice. Leave to steep in a warm place and use the warm spicy, strained water to mix the dough. Sift the flour and salt and rub in the lard; cream the yeast with the sugar and a little of the spiced water; mix this into the flour, together with the eggs and use enough of the water to give a firm, yet elastic dough. Knead well, leave to rise and knock back; blend in the drained fruit and knead again. Shape the dough into loaves and set into greased 1 lb tins in a warm place to prove; bake, reducing the temperature after the first 15 minutes. Originally, in some recipies, the fruit content would have been fresh currants or blackberries. Bara Brith is often served as part of the traditional Welsh tea. It can also be purchased at many of the small bakeries found throughout Wales. British Cookery (BTA/BFPC) File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip</li>

      <li>Ingredients for Barbecue Consomme</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs, and head To further explore the international links of various cuisines, check out this one and remember a few months back when we were talking abou the Pacific Island custom of cooking in pits. I didn't realize that the Mexicans also had such a practice. Here's a series of recipes revolving around Mexican Barbacoa or BBQ. To be very authentic, use a lamb which has been slaughtered the day before the cookout and hung overnight. On the day of the big event, the animal is split into sections: backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs, and head. METHOD: We assume that no one would tackle this kind of barbecue without a large number of guests-the kind who really like to pitch in. So, the first thing to do is to set one group of your guests to digging a hole about four feet by two feet across. Other members of the party can scout up kindling and others can be set to work cleaning each maguey leaf. Once the hole is dug, it is plastered with mud to keep the walls firm. Large porous stones should then be placed in the bottom of the pit (beware of little hard rocks; they'll split open). Over the stones put enough dry wood to fill the pit, then set fire to the wood and let it burn to the smokeless coal stage. While the fire is burning down, the maguey leaves should be toasted until limp, for this will enable them to release precious juices needed to season the meat. When the fire has burned down sufficiently, line the pit with the maguey leaves, making sure that all of the mud is covered so meat will not stick to pit. The leaves should be suspended vertically, the tips overlapping all the way around and held down with stones for the moment. The next step is to lower a grate into the hole and on it place the casserole with soup ingredients. On top of the uncovered casserole ingredients, arrange the lamb pieces, starting with the backbone, then the legs, shoulders, rib sections, and the head. Do not salt meat before it is cooked, for this can toughen it. After meat is in the pit, fold the tips of the maguey leaves into the hole to cover the meat well. Over this place a metal sheet to keep any earth from seeping into the pit and then seal the pit with a coat of fresh mud and build a large fire over the metal sheet and mud cover. Keep the fire blazing for 5 or 6 hours, depending upon the age of the meat. Open the pit, salt the meat before serving it, and accompany it with Salsa Borracha*. The broth is served in small cups. * See Shepherd's Roast with Drunken Sauce for recipe. From "The Art of Mexican Cooking" by Jan Aaron and Sachs Salom. Doubleday and Company, N.Y., 1965.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Chicken breast; boned, skinned cut in bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 slice Ginger; fresh, diced fine</li>
      <li>1 Clove garlic; pressed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Canola oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Onion; chopped</li>
      <li>4 Mushrooms; fresh, diced fine</li>
      <li>2 Zucchini; cut into cubes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cilantro; fresh, chopped fine</li>
      <li>1 cup Rice; cooked</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chicken broth; or as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Slivered almonds</li>
      <li>Soy sauce; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place chicken pieces in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and 2 tablespoons soy sauce. stir to coat and let stand while preparing the remaining vegetables. Put the canola oil into a medium sized skillet (or wok). Saute the onions until they are limp. Add the mushrooms and saute until they give up their juice. Remove the vegetables and reserve. Put the chicken and it's spices in the skillet, being careful to drain most of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and slightly browned. Add the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3 minutes. Add the rice, the reserved vegetables and enough of the chicken stock to keep the rice from sticking. Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the almonds and serve immediately. Note: This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I very often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With cooked vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and add them just early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not to use vegetables that will become mushy with the heating, you will want them to still be tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli, even spinach.

      <li>1 tablespoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>

      <li>1 3/4 Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>3 Egg whites</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>2 cups Shredded fresh coconut</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans. To make cake: In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks, whole eggs and sugar with an electric mixer for at least 5 minutes or until light and fluffy. Stir the butter or margarine pieces into the hot milk until the butter has melted. Combine the flour with the baking powder. Add 1/2 cup of the flour mixture into the egg mixture, beating slowly. Add half the hot milk mixture, 1 cup of the flour mixture, then the remaining hot milk, beating after each addition. Add the remaining flour mixture and the vanilla. Beat well. Fold in the nuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake the layers in the 350-degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes in the pans. Remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely on wire racks. To make the frosting: In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar with the water. Bring the mixture to boiling and boil for 2 minutes or until it is syrupy and the sugar dissolves. (Undissolved sugar will make the frosting grainy.) Make sure to scrape down the sides of the saucepan and stir in a figure-eight motion. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar with an electric mixer until foamy. Slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the egg whites, beating constantly at the highest speed 4 to 6 minutes or until the frosting is stiff enough to spread. Use a rubber spatula to guide the egg whites toward the beaters and scrape down the sides of the bowl to be sure that the frosting is evenly mixed. Beat in the vanilla. The finished frosting should be smooth and fluffy, yet hold stiff peaks. Place a cake layer on a cake plate; spread with about 1 cup of frosting and sprinkle with 1/3 cup of coconut. Repeat with the remaining layers. Frost the sides of the cake and sprinkle with the remaining coconut. Store the cake in the refrigerator up to 24 hours. Tips from our kitchen: Garnish this lovely cake with fresh coconut pieces, kiwi fruit, fresh pineapple and pineapple leaves.

Roll it like a big sausage around a stick (put butter on the stick before) and bake on a fire camp untill the bread is golden. You have to do this in the woods, of course, with a blanket around the shoulders (it's still cold at 6 in the morning...). Have a nice time camping! Brigitte.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 pounds Dried fruit</li>
      <li>1 pint Warm water</li>
      <li>2 pounds Plain flour</li>
      <li>6 ounces Lard</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Demerara sugar</li>
      <li>4 ounces Candied peel</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Mixed spice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 ounce Fresh yeast</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Oven: 450F, Gas Mark 8 for 15 minutes: 375F, Gas Mark 5 for 45 minutes. Soak the fruit and candied peel in the water with the spice. Leave to steep in a warm place and use the warm spicy, strained water to mix the dough. Sift the flour and salt and rub in the lard; cream the yeast with the sugar and a little of the spiced water; mix this into the flour, together with the eggs and use enough of the water to give a firm, yet elastic dough. Knead well, leave to rise and knock back; blend in the drained fruit and knead again. Shape the dough into loaves and set into greased 1 lb tins in a warm place to prove; bake, reducing the temperature after the first 15 minutes. Originally, in some recipies, the fruit content would have been fresh currants or blackberries. Bara Brith is often served as part of the traditional Welsh tea. It can also be purchased at many of the small bakeries found throughout Wales. British Cookery (BTA/BFPC) File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/welsh.zip</li>

      <li>1 cup Unsalted Butter; Very Cold (no substitutes)</li>
      <li>2 cups All-purpose Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sour Cream; Cold</li>
      <li>1 large Egg Yolk; Slightly Beaten</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>1 can (8-oz) Almond Paste; or Make Your Own</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Blanched Almonds</li>
      <li>1/2 cups White Sugar</li>
      <li>1 large Egg; Slightly Beaten</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Almond Extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The confectioners of The Netherlands rank among the finest in Europe, so don’t get frustrated if you need to try this recipe two or three times to master your preparation. These little almond-based confections are immensely popular for the holidays in The Netherlands. Banketletters are flaky, puffed pastries filled with a delectable almond paste and shaped into a letter, usually an initial. One of the most popular letters is “M”-- for Mother. “M” also happens to be one of the larger letters to select and serve. No Sinterklaas Eve gathering would be complete without a large pastry letter adorning the serving table. In a large bowl cut butter into small pieces and add to flour. Utilize a pastry blender or 2 knives and cut the butter into the flour until the butter is the size of peas. In a separate bowl, mix sour cream with the egg yolk and blend into the flour and butter mixture with a fork until the dough forms a ball. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, wrap well and refrigerate for several hours (or several days, if desired). Allow dough to return to room temperature before preparing cookies. If you are preparing your own almond filling, grind the almonds well and mix with the sugar and almond extract in a bowl. Add the egg and use a wooden spoon or you hands to work the mixture until it is smooth. Almond paste will keep for several weeks when wrapped securely and refrigerated. To prepare the cookies roll the room temperature dough out into 1/2-inch thickness and cut dough into strips 3 1/2 to 4-inches long. Work the almond filling into little round sticks about the length and diameter of your finger. Lay the almond paste sticks on the dough strips individually. Place a dab of cold water on the end of each dough stick with almond filling and tuck under. Make sure to place cookies seam-side-down on a cookie sheet. Sticks may be formed into letters or wreaths, or any shape you desire. Parts of letters can be joined by adding a dab of water to the joint of the cookie. Prior to baking brush each cookie with 1 egg that has been beaten with 1 Tbs. of water. Bake cookies in a pre-heated 400-F degree oven for 20 to 25 -minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack. Cookies may be served warm, if desired. Refrigerate to store and serve at room temperature.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 Sweet onions; quartered</li>
      <li>1 1/2 medium Cucumbers; peeled and cut into</li>
      <li>2 small Green bell peppers; cut into 8 pieces</li>
      <li>6 medium Tomatoes; cut into 8 pieces</li>
      <li>5 large Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 cup V-8® vegetable juice</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoons Chili powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kosher salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>With the metal blad ein place, add the onion to the beaker. Process, turning on and off rapidly, until finely chopped, about 4 or 5 seconds. Transfer onion to a large bowl. Repeat with cucumbers, then green peppers, and then 5 of the tomatoes. Transfer all to the large bowl. Process remaining tomato with garlic, V-8, olive oil, and chili powder until a smooth liquid is formed. Combine with chopped vegetables and chill in a covered container. Before serving, taste for salt. If texture is too thick, add more V-8, or a combination of V-8 and beef bouillon. Makes 1 1/2 quarts. NOTE: Make this soup at least a couple hours before serving, so the flavors have a chance to combine. Overnight is even better. NOTES : Delicious. I've adapted this over the years - little or no olive oil, but more V-8 or Clamato juice - or a combination (1/2 and 1/2) of V-8 and beef bouillon . It tastes terrific with seasoned croutons. It's a very nice thing to have in the refrigerator during the heat of the summer.

Use a 9 x 5 inch loaf ban (nonstick or sprayed with Pam). Cook at 350 (175C) for about an hour until it passes the toothpick test. Note: I usually add some vanilla as well. It's supposed to make 16 servings, but they are paper thin slices--so I'd guess 8-10 real people servings. I haven't tried freezing it yet.

      <li>1 cup Rice Milk (maybe more?)</li>

      <li>powder. Add a small amount of the rice milk and start to blend. Add more rice milk as necessary until the banana goes from chunks to puree, then blend for another minute or two before adding the rest of the rice milk and optional vanilla. If you try to blend all the ingredients at once you're likely to end up with un-blended banana chunks. This recipe is a good way to use over-ripe bananas, which we peel and freeze when they've been on the counter for a bit too long. From: Raymond.Jackson@ebay.sun.com (Raymond Jackson).

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Not only are the flavors of this dessert deliciously rich, but the contrast between the cold mousse and the warm cream is almost addictive. Prcheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the bananas on a baking sheet, and bake in the oven until they tum black and the skins split, about 10 minutes. Let cool a little and then peel the bananas and pur‚e in a food processor or blender. Pour the banana pur‚e into 2 inch ramekins and refrigerate for 2 hours. To prepare the Mac' Nut Cream, melt the butter in a saucepan, add the sugar and macadamia nuts, and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until the mixture turns a dark golden brown. Stir in the cream and when incorporated, remove the pan from the heat and cool to room temperature. When ready to serve, warm the Mac' Nut Cream gently. For the garnish, whip the cream with the sugar until soft peaks form. To serve, place a chilled banana mousse on each serving plate and remove the parchment paper. Top with the whipped cream and pour the warm Mac' Nut Cream around.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Rose Murray, The Christmas Cookbook Great Canadian Prepare two 2 Litre (9" x 5") loaf pans. Preheat oven to 300 F. In a large bowl combine the fruit, dates, pineapple and walnuts. Dredge them with 1/4 cup of the flour. Sift the remaining flour together with the baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Set aside. Cream the butter, add the sugar and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Beat in the orange rind, orange juice and orange extract. Mash the bananas with a fork. (A food processor will tend to liquefy the bananas and this will change the texture of the cake.) Alternately stir the bananas and the flour mixture into the creamed mixture. Stir in the floured fruit and nuts. Turn into the prepared pans and bake for 2 hours and 15 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 20 minutes, then turn out onto racks. Yields about 5 pounds of cake. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Stir for 5 or 6 minutes or longer with the heat turned down to medium. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes or so. Add the beaten eggs to this while whisking the mixture energetically. Add the dates, brown sugar, and the walnuts (if you want them). Add 1/2 a tsp of ginger powder, and finally, the foodprocessed bananas. WHisk well. Butter an 8 or 9 inch pan. Sprinkle its bottom and sides with white sugar so that they are coated completely with a thin layer of sugar. Gently shake out any excess. Pour the pudding mixture into pan, and bake for 50 minutes to an hour. While it is baking, prepare the mango sauce. Boil together the mangoes, sugar, ginger, and 2 cups water (or the undrained peaches, sugar, ginger and 1 cup water), cooking it over medium heat for about 10 minutes or so. Pour this through a strainer, forcing the fruit pulp through with the back of a wooden spoon. Mix well. Cool the pudding in pan for about 5 minutes. Turn it out onto a cake plate or any serving plate, and smother it with the sauce on top. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <title>Banana Jam (Weird But Good)</title>
    <category>Condiments</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 Ripe bananas, mashed</li>
      <li>3 Lemons</li>
      <li>3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>3 cups Water</li>
      <li>Olive-sized pieces of fresh</li>
      <li>Ginger</li>
      <li>Some whole clovers</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Squeeze juice from lemons and slice the rind into paper thin strips Boil the sugar and water for 10 minutes, then add the juice and rind, the bananas, ginger and a few cloves (to taste). Cook slowly for 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour. Stir carefully so it won't scorch. It'll be pale (actually a weird pinkish color.) Take out ginger. Put in jars and process 10 minutes in water bath covered by 1". About 7 8oz jars. This is truly a strange "jam." But it's delicious on toast, waffles, or muffins, and little kids like it. I discovered by accident that banana jam also makes a truly wonderful filling for one of my favorite desserts, a little number called Farfel Cake (which contains no farfel and is not a cake.) I will provide it. It really is a great recipe--easy to make, delicious to eat and even a little impressive to look at. Great with hot coffee or tea.

Coat an 8x4 loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray. Spread mixture evenly in the pan, and bake at 325 F for 40-45 minutes, or just until a wooden toothpick inserted in the ceneter of the loaf comes clean. 3.

      <li>I've never tried this but I suspect that it's quite similar to the Filipino Jufran and Mafran sauces that I love so much. They're made from bananas also and taste like catsup *should* taste. Combine the raisins, onions , garlic, tomato paste and 1/3 cup vinegar in the container of a food processor., Process the mixture until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large, heavy saucepan. Add the banana chunks and another 1/3 cup vinegar to the food processor container. Process the mixture until smooth. Transfer the banana mixture to the saucepan. Add the remaining 2/3 cup vinegar, 3 cups water, brown sugar, salt and cayenne pepper. Bring the mixture in the saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to low and cook the ketchup, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/4 hours. If the ketchup threatens to stick to the bottom of the pan at any point, add some of the remaining water, up to 1 cup. Add the corn syrup, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper and cloves to the ketchup. Cook the ketchup over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes longer, or until it is thick enough to coat a metal spoon. Stir in the rum. Remove the ketchup from the heat and let it cool a few minutes. Force the ketchup through a fine sieve to strain it, pressing down hard on the solids. Remove the ketchup from the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Store the banana ketchup, covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. Makes about 3 1/2 cups.

I'm sorry I don't remember who posted this, but thanks! (Mix dry ingredients and fruit, add juice and stir just until blended. Put in muffin cups and bake at 305 degrees for about 25 min.)

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Bananas; Ripe, Md</li>
      <li>1 Egg; Large, Unbeaten</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Light Molasses Or Syrup</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Walnuts; Chopped, Optional</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mash the bananas until no lumps remain. Add the unbeaten egg, mixing well. Beat in the sugar, molasses and the shortening. (NOTE: The secret of this recipe is to mix the above ingredients well until very smooth.) Sift the flour, baking power, soda, and salt together and add to the liquid mixture. As these are a quick bread, do not beat the dry mixture into the liquid but rather fold it in only until it is moistened and no streaks remain. Spoon the mixture into a muffin tin that has been sprayed with a non-stick coating. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until done. Serve warm. From "Make Mine Healthy" by Mimi Morgan.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Mindy Compton &lt;mlcompton@ucdavis.edu&gt; Date: Tue, 4 Apr 1995 15:19:02 GMT Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Beat together sugar and shortening in large bowl until well combined. Beat in eggs, mashed bananas and vanilla. Beat in flour mixture. Then beat in buttermilk. Pour batter equally into two greased and floured 9-inch round cake pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely. Frost one cake with whipped cream frosting, and placed a single layer of banana slices on top. Then place second cake on top, and frost entire cake. Garnish with banana slices. Tip: When making whipped cream frosting, I know that a lot of people don't add sugar when whipping. From my experiences with this cake, I find that while whipping the cream I like to add some granulated sugar to it to make it a little more sweet-it complements the cake better. Also: make sure that your heavy cream is cold and you whip it until good peaks form, or else it won't frost well. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CAKES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Place ingredient Group A in Bakery Pan. Press SELECT for Quick Bread. Press BAKING CONTROL for Light. Press Start. Mix for 1 minute and 15 seconds, scraping down sides of pan with spatula if necessary. 2. Add ingredient Group B. Mix for 1 minute and 15 seconds, scraping down sides of pan if necessary. 3. Add ingredient groups C, then D and then E. Scrape down sides of pan if necessary. 4. After mixing, lower lid and tent a piece of aluminium foil, shiny side down, over glass dome. Loaf will be ready in 1-1/2 hours. ** Note: In order to substitute the granulated sugar and the brown sugar, I use the equivalency amount of Sweet 'n Low Regular and Sweet 'n Low Brown. The texture does not change the finished product. *** Note: In place of walnuts, I use slivered almonds. They are lower in fat than walnuts. I have also added dried cherries, blueberries, and craisens as well. This changes the flavor dramatically (and deliciously). Egg substitute can also be used without a problem.

      <li>+------------------------------ FILLING ~-------------------------------- +------------------------------ MERINGUE ~-------------------------------- To make pastry, combine flour, sugar and butter in a food processor. Process until the consistency of fine meal. Add beaten egg; continue to process just until dough starts to come together. Gather into a ball, wrap and refrigerate for one hour or place in freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Roll out dough on a floured surface or roll out between two sheets of plastic wrap to an 11-inch circle. Dough is sticky and falls apart easily; just patch together and fit into a nine-inch flan pan with removable bottom; trim edges. (If you don't have a flan pan, a pie plate can be used.) Chill for 30 minutes. Bake pastry at 375 degrees for 12 minutes until light golden in color. Thinly slice five of the bananas and arrange on bottom of pastry shell. Mash the remaining banana and combine with warm cream, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. Pour over banana layer. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes or until filling is set. Let pie cool slightly. To make meringue, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/3 cup sugar until meringue is stiff and glossy. Spread meringue over warm pie; bake at 350 degrees for 12 - 15 minutes or until browned. Let cool; refrigerate until serving time. Serves 6. From The Gazette, 91/02/13.

Mix together 1 1/4 c. of flour, coconut, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Combine banana, oil and honey. Stir into flour mixture quickly but gently until just combined. Add part of the remaining 1/4 cup flour if needed. Batter will be lumpy. Spread batter evenly in a lightly greased (and/or waxed paper lined) 8x4 loaf pan. Bake at 350 F about 45 min until tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 min in pan. Turn out of pan, cool completely on rack. Wrap in waxed paper and store overnight before slicing.

Add the banana, buttermilk, egg whites,a nd vanilla extract, and stir to mix well. Coat a 9 x 13" pan with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the batter evenly in the pan. Bake at 350 deg F for about 35 min., or just until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cake to room temp. To make the glaze, combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl. If using a microwa e oven, microwave the glaze, uncovered, at high power for 35 seconds, or until runny. If using a conventional stove top, transfer the glaze to a small saucepan and place over medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Drizzle the glaze over the cake, and let harden before cutting into squares and serving. This is quick and really excellent tasting.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Boil the potatoes until tender. Drain and push through a food mill or sieve. Let cool. 2. Bring the beer, butter, and salt to a boil, and boil gently until butter has melted. 3. Pour in the flour all at once and beat with a wooden spoon until the dough forms a mass and leaves the sides of the pan. 4. Off the heat, beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating until completely blended. (If you have a food processor, transfer the dough to the food processor bowl and beat in the eggs one by one, using the steel blade.) 5. Beat in the potatoes, sugar, and the baking powder. 6. Remove to a well-floured board and roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut into rounds with a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter. 7. Place an apricot in the center of each round and bring up the dough to enclose the apricot. Roll into a ball and dust with flour. 8. Bring the water to a boil. Drop the dumplings into the boiling water and simmer until they rise to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon and arrange them in a buttered ovenproof dish. 9. Pour buttered bread crumbs over the apricot dumplings and bake on a 375 degree oven until golden brown. Serve immediately. Yield: About 10 to 12 dumplings.

      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Milk</li>

      <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
      <li>4 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Apricot brandy or orange liqueur</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva) Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 07:27:35 GMT In a small heavy saucepan, combine the apricots, 2 tablespoons of the sugar and 2/3 cup water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer, uncovered, until the apricots are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the apricots and any remaining liquid to a food processor and puree until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice. Set aside. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine the milk and tea leaves. Warm over low heat until the milk is hot. Remove from the heat and let steep for 5 minutes. Strain the milk through a fine-meshed strainer. Return the milk to the saucepan and add the heavy cream, remaining 1/3 cup sugar and salt. Cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture is hot, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until blended. Gradually whisk in one-third of the hot cream in a thin stream, then whisk the mixture back into the remaining cream in the saucepan. Cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard lightly coats the back of the spoon, 5 to 7 minutes; do not let boil. Immediately remove from the heat and strain the custard into a medium bowl. Set the bowl in a larger bowl of ice and water. Let the custard cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Whisk in the reserved apricot puree and the brandy until blended. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 6 hours or overnight. Pour the custard into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /DESSERTS From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>3 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>12 medium Apricots</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CRUMB TOPPING</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Unsalted butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Use this recipe with peaches, sour cherries or pineapple with equally good results. CAKE BATTER: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Butter a 10-inch round, 2-inch deep cake pan and line the bottom with a disk of parchment or wax paper. In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft and light. Add the egg and continue beating until light. Add the yolks one at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Sift together the flour and baking powder and stir into the batter. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Rinse and halve the apricots. Remove the pits with the bowl of a small spoon if they resist. Arrange the apricot halves cut-side up on the batter in concentric rows, overlapping slightly, leaving a margin of about 1-inch around the edge. Don't be concerned if the apricots mound slightly in the center of the cake; the top will even out as the cake bakes. CRUMB TOPPING: FOR THE CRUMBS, mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Melt the butter and stir it in evenly. Rub the mixture to coarse crumbs by hand. Scatter the crumbs over the apricots and the edge of the batter as evenly as possible. Bake the cake 1 hour until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for about 15 minutes and invert a plate on it. Invert onto the plate and lift off the pan. Peel off the paper and invert a rack on the cake. Invert cake onto the rack, remove the plate and cool. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe! Mix together (with bare hands is fun). If it's too runny add some crushed biscuits. Roll into a snake and dust lightly in either castor sugar or more coconut. Chop into 1cm thick pieces. Eat the rest of the condensed milk (straight out of the tin) while the apricot delight is chilled in the fridge. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CANDY From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <category>Sauces</category>
    <category>And</category>
    <category>Rubs</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 small Habanero peppers; dried</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter; (optional)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>12 Whole golden raisins; chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Apricot preserves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon White wine vinegar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a good-sized skillet heat about a half-cup water over medium heat until it begins steaming. Carefully cut small slices from the dried habanero and chop those finely to accumulate about 1/2 tsp. or so of flakes, adjusting to your taste and heat tolerance. (You might want to wear rubber gloves when touching the pepper; at least be careful and don't touch your eyes until your hands have been thoroughly washed.) Add the pepper flakes with the salt and butter to the water and allow the flakes to soften and the butter to melt. Add the brown sugar (stir to dissolve) and raisins. When the water is simmering, add the apricot preserves. Cut up any large pieces of apricot in the pan, and make sure all the gelatinous matter is dissolved. Add the vinegar a little at a time, being careful not to make the mixture at all sour; the vinegar should just brighten up the taste. Allow the glaze to simmer. As it thickens, water can be added a bit at a time to keep the glaze from scorching; it should be allowed to darken a bit. Coat grilled chops or meat slices with the glaze by simmering the meats with the glaze for a couple minutes on each side. Spread a teaspoon or so on each serving plate and arrange meats on top. Little mint sprigs and curls of orange peel could be used to give a truly goofy appearance, if you like that kinda thing.

    <title>Apricot Habanero Glaze</title>
    <category>Sauce</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 small Dried Habanero (we'll only use a very small piece)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter (optional)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>12 Golden raisins; chopped up</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Apricot preserves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon White wine vinegar or lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mike McNally &lt;m5@tivoli.com&gt; In a good-sized skillet heat about a half-cup water over medium heat until it begins steaming. Carefully cut small slices from the dried habanero and chop those finely to accumulate about 1/2 tsp or so of flakes, adjusting to your taste and heat tolerance. (You might want to wear rubber gloves when touching the pepper; at least be careful and don't touch your eyes until your hands have been thoroughly washed.) Add the pepper flakes with the salt and butter to the water and allow the flakes to soften and the butter to melt. Add the brown sugar (stir to dissolve) and raisins. When the water is simmering, add the apricot preserves. Cut up any large pieces of apricot in the pan, and make sure all the gelatinous matter is dissolved. Add the vinegar a little at a time, being careful not to make the mixture at all sour; the vinegar should just brighten up the taste. Allow the glaze to simmer. As it thickens, water can be added a bit at a time to keep the glaze from scorching; it should be allowed to darken a bit. Coat grilled chops or meat slices with the glaze by simmering the meats with the glaze for a couple minutes on each side. Spread a teaspoon or so on each serving plate and arrange meats on top. Little mint sprigs and curls of orange peel could be used to give a truly foofy appearance, if you like that kinda thing. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>yes, those are all of the ingredients! Here's how ya do it! Peel the bananas and mash in a large bowl with the sugar and vanilla. This will turn to a thick, fragrant glop (a technical term) in a few minutes. Stir in the flour and baking soda a bit at a time, until it's all incorporated. Pour this mixture into a glass dish (just about anything should work, we've done it in a loaf pan too and it works great) and sprinkle some cinnamon on the top. Bake in a 350 over for 50 min - 1 hr. Now, this bread is not the texture of the familiar banana bread, which i think has more the consistency of a muffin or cake. This will actually have the texture of a chewy, dense bread!

    <category>Sugar free</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Ripe bananas; mashed</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup Blueberries; fresh or frozen</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a large bowl mash bananas well, stir in water, oil and egg. 2. Mix in the flour, cinnamon, baking soda and powder and beat with a fork about 2 minutes. The batter is thick at first, but loosens as you beat it. 3. Gently fold in the blueberries. 4. Fill greased muffin tins 3/4 full and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. NOTES : If using frozen fruits, thaw and drain before folding into the batter. I originally got this from a great sugar free cookbook, have since modified them a bit and make them almost every weekend. As these don't have preservatives you'll need to eat them within 4 days or so.

      <li>1 tablespoon Grated orange rind</li>
      <li>4 Very ripe bananas; mashed (about 1-1/3 cups)</li>
      <li>1 cup Matzah cake meal</li>
      <li>1 cup Coarsely ground almonds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Mon, 1 Apr 1996 22:32:01 -7 From: arlenes@holly.ColoState.EDU SANDI BROOKS WFCJ53B In a large bowl, with an electric mixer beat the yolks and they are thick and pale. Gradually add the sugar, beating until the mixture is very thick. Beat in the lemon juice and the rind, add the bananas, the matzah cake meal, the almonds and the salt and beat the mixture until it is combined well. In a clean dry bowl, with clean dry beater beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks, stir 1 cup of them into the banana mixture and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly, Pour the batter into an ungreased 9" tube pan (3-1/2" deep) with a removable bottom and bake the torte in the middle of a preheated 350 oven for 55-60 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Invert the pan over the neck of a bottle and let the torte cool upside down. Run a thin knife around the edge and tube of the pan and remove the side of the pan. Run the knife under the bottom of the torte to release it and transfer the torte carefully with 2 spatulas to a serving plate. I hope you enjoy this as much as I have.

Add one spoon of honey for each banana (more, if you feel emotionally fragile and need lots of sweet). "Fry" at low heat, turning sometimes the banana slices so that the melted honey covers them all over. It's done when you can't resist looking at the bananas anymore and feel the urge to eat them.

Sift together into a mixing bowl the flour, baking soda and salt. Cut in the cold butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Lightly stir in banana puree to make a damp dough. Turn out onto floured surface and roll or pat to 1 inch thick. Cut into 2-1/2-inch circles with floured cutter. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Combine 2-1/2 cups cream and the brown sugar in a heavy saucepan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 10 to 12 minutes. Do not scorch. Allow to cool about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whip the rest of the cream and the granulated sugar together until soft peaks form. To assemble, stir rum and banana liqueur into the warm sauce. Split the biscuits and place on individual plates. Top with banana slices; drizzle with sauce. Top with whipped cream. Makes 10 servings.

      <li>A quintessential New Orleans dessert, and a favorite among most locals. This dish cannot be prepared in the kitchen. It must be performed, in front of your guests. Use a chafing dish, and some kind of portable heat like Sterno. Don't be sloppy, and keep a fire extinguisher handy. There's no need to burn the house down just for dessert, but this really must be done right. I learned to cook this dish from Chef Joe Cahn at the New Orleans School of Cooking, and he spun dire tales of what befell those who dared sequester themselves in the kitchen when making Bananas Foster. Seriously, bad gris-gris will befall you if you deprive your guests of the spectacle. Plus, they'll talk for years about how cool you are to have made this for their dessert. First, you should make some preparations. Peel a thin strip of peel from the bananas, and use your knife to slice the banana crossways into coins. Then replace the banana peel so that it looks untouched (as best as you can, anyway). This way, you can pretend to "peel" your bananas, and dump them into the put already cut, as if by magic. Cheesy, you ask? Well, it still looks cool, particularly if you're really nonchalant when you do this in front of your guests. If you insist, you can slice the bananas the classical way, quartering them by slicing thm lengthwise and then in half. I still think the other way is cooler. Put your ground cinnamon into some kind of non-standard container, or even a little muslin bag, the better to "convince" your guests that it is, in fact, not cinnamon but voodoo dust, scraped from the tomb of Marie Laveau at midnight on All Soul's Day ... some kind of delightfully corny crap like that. Also, I recommend taking a cinnamon stick and grinding it fresh in a spice or coffee grinder instead of using pre-ground cinnamon. Sieve the result through a tea ball strainer to remove the larger pieces which won't grind finely. This will maximize the fresh, aromatic cinnamon flavor. If you use your coffee grinder, it'll also make your coffee taste great. Now, to business ... Melt the butter and add the brown sugar to form a creamy paste. Let this mixture caramelize over the heat for about 5 minutes. Stir in the banana liqueur and rum. Heat until the liquor is warmed, about three minutes. Add the bananas, cook for about 1 - 2 minutes, then ignite with a flourish. Here's the best way to do this: Using a long, bent-handled ladle, scoop up some of the warm liquor. Hold it a foot or two above the chafing dish and ignite the liquor in the ladle. VERY CAREFULLY, pour the liquor into the dish. A column of flame will descend from the ladle into the dish, which will ignite with a marvelous *poof*! Keep a pal nearby, subtly wielding a fire extinguisher. Try not to become a human torch in the process. Agitate to keep the flame burning, and add a few pinches of "voodoo dust" to the flame. The cinnamon will sparkle orange in the blue flame, and looks really neat. Let the flames go out. Serve over ice cream if you wish, but some hardcores like me like it just like it is. Yum. Variations: one may substitute any fruit for this dish that has a correspondingly flavored liqueur -- peaches, pears, whatever.

      <li>Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way (I used a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan). Fold each pancake in half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle (if you're as bad at cooking pancakes as I am, they'll come out in bits anyway - if so, pretend it didn't happen!), and place them in a large flan dish. Peel bananas, cut in half long-ways and in half again cross-ways, and place face-down on top of the pancakes. Put the remaining ingredients into a frying pan or small saucepan, and boil for 3-4 minutes, until just beginning to be syrupy. Pour over bananas and pancakes, and bake in a moderate oven (Mark 4 - 350 F) for 20-30 minutes. I served this with fromage frais (cream substitute) and a chocolate sauce, for which the recipe follows: Recipe by: Annabel Smith Converted to MM by Donna Webster donna@webster.demon.co.uk From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: gt92rfl@brunel.ac.uk (Ros Lumley) Date: Wed, 27 Apr 1994 03:06:59 GMT This is a recipe my Mum has given to me. Its yummy. She makes them in a loaf tin. They are light rather like a sponge cake in consistency. This makes two, and they freeze well. NOTE: the amount of milk is dependent on the ripeness of the bananas. The mushier they are the less or no milk.&gt; Cream the butter and sugar well. Add the eggs one at a time and cream well. Add mashed banana. Add flour, salt and baking powder to the mixture and if necessary the milk, to keep the mixture "slack" rather than like a thick batter. Add the vanilla. Put into the tins, loaf or cake. Bake in a moderate oven for 45 mins to 1 hour. Moderate is about 180 degrees Celcius, 250 Farheinheit, and about Gas Mark 5. Pierce with a knife to ensure its cooked. if the knife is clean then its done. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>(or 1 1/2 t. at high altitude)*</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baking soda</li>

      <li>1 1/2 cups Mashed bananas</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups All-bran¨ cereal; (k ellogg's)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Applesauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Honey ; (1/4 to 1/2)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe by: Nabisco 100% Bran Cereal Box Here's my recipe adapted from a recipe on the Nabisco 100% Bran cereal box. This makes a very dense and heavy muffin just the way I like it. If you prefer a lighter muffin than just add all-purpose flour for some or part of the whole wheat flour. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in large bowl. Beat egg in medium bowl, stir in bananas, cereal, water, applesauce, vanilla, and honey. Add to flour mixture. Stir JUST UNTIL MOISTENED! (Batter will be lumpy.) Fill muffin tin. Makes 12 average size muffins. Bake at 400 F. for 18-22 min. A good variation that I have tried is using pureed peaches instead of bananas. You might have to cut back on the water a little for that depending on how juicy your peaches are. When I add peaches I also like to add a little extra nutmeg. Maybe I should try this with rhubarb. I know I would have to increase the honey quite a bit! Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #53 Date: Tue, 15 Oct 1996 23:03:58 -0800 From: "Jenny S. Johanssen" &lt;johanssen@matnet.com&gt;</li>

It's a good crowd pleaser if you make it at the table with an alcohol burner. Melt butter over alcohol burner or in attractive skillet. Stir in sugar, cinnamon, and banana liquor, and heat a few minutes. Add bananas and saute until slightly browned. Add rum, heat well, then tip pan to ignite. ("This is unnecessary without an audience, unless you like fire." The alcohol will boil off after about 2 minutes.) Sift bananas carefully out of pan, place four pieces over each scoop if ice cream. Spoon sauce over top. Serves 4. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /FRUIT From rec.food.cooking archives. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <title>Banana and Kiwi Spring Rolls</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 large Firm; ripe bananas</li>
      <li>3 medium Firm; ripe kiwi, peeled and sliced (up to 4)</li>
      <li>6 Spring roll wrappers (6 and 1/2 inches each), thawed, if frozen</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons (packed) light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 large Egg white; lightly beaten</li>
      <li>Peanut oil; for deep frying</li>
      <li>Confectioners' sugar; for dusting the roll</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Somehow I don't think these are exactly what you're looking for. But these are good recipes, so I'm taking the opportunity to post them anyway. These all came from a cookbook I cannot recommend enough, The Terrific Pacific Cookbook. Cut a banana in half lengthwise. Place one banana, cut side up, on your work surface, and on it position 3 to 5 of the kiwi slices (or as many as will fit without overlapping the slices). Top with the other banana half. Holding the banana firmly, cut it in half crosswise. Repeat with the remaining banana and kiwi. Place a spring roll wrapper on the work surface with a corner facing you. Place a stuffed banana half horizontally across the middle of the wrapper. Sprinkle the banana with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the brown sugar. Fol dthe bottom corner of the wrapper over the banana and tuck it under. Fold in the sides and roll the banana almost up to the end. Brush the top corner with a little egg white, roll up and press firmly to seal. Prepare the rest of the rolls in the same fashion. Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches into a wok or deep skilled and heat over medium-high heat to 375. Fry the rolls, three at a time, until deep golden, about 4 minutes. Turn several times during the frying process. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to a double layer of paper towels to drain. Repeat with the rest of the rolls. Place the rolls on individuals plates, sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. If you like, top with a dollop of Coconut-Rum or other whipped cream. Serve at once.

      <li>1 tablespoon Palm Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Pomegranates</li>
      <li>3 Bananas</li>
      <li>Juice of 2 limes</li>
      <li>Lime Dressing</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This is a side-dish from the north of India. It makes a refreshing and pretty contrast to a highly spiced dish and couldn't be simpler. Try it next time you are having a curry meal, or use it as one of several salads for entertaining. Mix together the juice of 2 limes and a tablespoon of palm sugar (or substitute brown sugar). Taste and adjust for sweet- sour balance if necessary. Cut 2 pomegranates which have been chilling in the fridge into quarters and twist each wedge to help free the seeds. Coax them out and mound them in the centre of a serving dish. Slice 3 bananas and arrange them around the peri- meter of the pomegranate seeds. Sprinkle with the lime dressing and serve.

      <li>3 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>2 ounces Rum</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Peel bananas, splitting lengthwise and cutting in halves. Place bananas in a buttered, shallow, oven-proof baking dish and dot with butter. Sprinkle sugar over bananas. Bake uncovered at 325'F for about 35 minutes. Set dish on stove, being careful to keep warm. Pour rum in a long-handled spoon, which has been warmed by dipping in boiling water. Set a match to the rum and as it flames pour over bananas. As it runs down in the dish, ladle it up and over the bananas until the flaming ceases. The secret of this dessert is to have all ingredients warm, otherwise it will not flame well. This old recipe, as good today as years ago, was brought to Louisiana by a distant relative of Empress Josephine, at whose table this was often served.

    <ingredient>
      <li>100 grams Carrots</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>100 grams Green beans</li>
      <li>4 Scallions</li>
      <li>100 grams White cabbage</li>
      <li>2 Toes of garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 Cucumber</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
      <li>150 mililiters Vinegar</li>
      <li>100 grams Bean sprouts/shoots</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Powdered ginger</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Kunjit/kurkuma</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sambal ulek</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut carrot into the size of matches. Cut beans in 1" pieces. Chafe the cabbage. In a pan with a little water and salt, boil the vegetables for 5 minutes. Drain. Cut cucumber in *small* cubes. Peel scallions and garlic. Put in kitchen machine; cut to paste. Mix with sambal, kunjit and ginger. Heat oil in a frying pan. Fry the herb-mixture for 2 minutes. Add vinegar and sugar; stir to dissolve sugar. Add all vegetables (also the ones not cooked yet); add a *little* water if there is too little liquid. Boil softly for 2 minutes. Put in a bowl and let cool. You can also preserve it by putting the hot veggies in sterilized screw-lid jars (metal lids with a 'dome' in the middle are quite handy, I always save jam-jars when they're empty); add liquid as well. Screw the lids on. Place jars upside down until cooled completely (the 'dome' in the lid will be down, this is to check if the jar closed well). Can be kept for at least a year (store in dark place to avoid having the color goes away). Nice as a present! Kunjit or kurkuma is a herb. If I look on the jar, it says 'powdered yellow-root'. It is used to color this dish, and other dishes as well. In that way it is much like saffron, although kunjit tastes a little bitter. Sambal ulek [INDONESIA]: Used as an accompaniment and in cooking. Made by crushing fresh red chilis with a little salt. Remove the seeds from the chilis, chop finely, then crush with salt using a pestle and mortar. Three chilis will make about 1 tablespoon sambal ulek. Also available ready-prepared in small jars from Oriental stores and some delicatessens. This is a refreshing side dish made of crisp, sweet-and-sour vegetables. Goes really well with Nasi Goreng. The dish can be kept in the fridge for a few days.</li>

Reduce speed to medium and continue beating while you slowly add lemon juice and stock mixture. Into same mixture, pour 2 cups of reserved chicken stock slowly, while continuously mixing. Turn mixer off. Pour egg and lemon mixture slowly into saucepan of rice and stock, stirring continually. Continue to stir for one minute while soup cooks. Remove from heat. Salt and pepper to taste.

      <li>*Egg wash (one egg, lightly beaten with 2 teaspoons milk) Preheat oven to 350 degrees On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to a rectangle measuring a little larger than 20 x 10 inches when relaxed. Brush off any excess flour. Square off the edges with a pizza cutter. Cut the rectangle into 10 5-inch squares. Spread each with remonce and/or the filling. Form the pastries. Place on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Proof, in a warm draft-free place, covered with a dish towel, until they are a little puffy and a finger pressed lightly into the dough leaves a slight indentation. Brush lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar or topping. Bake about 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a rack. While still warm, brush lightly with warm apricot glaze or drizzle with icing. Yield: 10 pastries Pinwheels: Spread with remonce. Sprinkle on some extra cinnamon sugar. Brush the of the square with egg wash. Cut a slit from each corner almost into the center, stopping just short of the center. Fold every other tip into the center, overlapping them, and press firmly. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Proof, covered, about 1/2 hour. Press the center down with your finger where the tips overlap and fill with 1/2 rounded teaspoon jam or filling. Eggwash, sprinkle with coarse sugar, and bake about 20 minutes, or until nicely colored. Envelopes: Spread square with remonce. Sprinkle with finely chopped chocolate mixed with sugar. Turn the square so that a point is at the top. Put and elongated mound of about 2 tablespoons of cheese filling from top to bottom. Egg wash the side corners. Fold one corner over the filling and press firmly. Fold the other end over the top and press very firmly to seal. Place on lined baking sheet and proof, covered, about 1/2 hour. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar and chopped chocolate. Bake about 20 minutes, or until nicely browned. (Or spread with lemon curd and then cheese filling and garnish before baking with toasted sliced almonds.) Cheese pockets: Spread the square with remonce. Place a rounded tablespoon of cheese filling in the middle of the square. Brush the corners with egg wash. Fold two opposite sides up and press firmly, as in the envelopes above. Bring the bottom corner up and press firmly over the fold. Lastly, bring the top corner up and across the fold and pinch it to seal. Proof, covered, as above. Egg wash and sprinkle the top with streusel. Bake about 25 minutes, until nicely browned. Turnovers: Spread with remonce. Place a big dollop of chunky homemade applesauce or pear sauce on one side of the square. Egg wash the edges and fold over into a triangle. Press around the edge with a fork to seal. Proof, etc. Before baking, egg wash and sprinkle with coarse or pearl sugar. Streusel: Whisk together the flour and sugar. Drizzle in the melted butter as you mix with your fingertips or a rubber spatula. continued in part 2</li>

      <li>Phillip Graebing wrote that he had lost his blueberry recipes. I have a cookbook called "The Blueberry Connection" - 209 pages of nothing but blueberry recipes. Being it's that time of the year, hopefully some of the following will refresh Phillip's files Dissolve gelatin in boiling water. Add sugar, juice and lemon rind. Chill until syrupy. Whip chilled milk. Fold berries and whipped milk into chilled syrup mixture. Pour into baked pie shell. Chill. Ymmmy! "The cultivated blueberry has been on the market for only about 45 years.

      <li>From: PatH &lt;phannema@wizard.ucr.edu&gt; Date: Fri, 26 Apr 1996 11:38:57 -0700 (PDT) Recipe By : Wisconsin Country Gourmet (posted by Hanneman) Look for "small new potatoes" with purple-red skins, and fewer deep eyes. Boil rinsed potatoes in plenty of lightly salted water, about 15 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and set aside. Cut the asparagus and carrots to size before cooking. Steam each vegetable separately (a dente). ~Asparagus (1-1/2 to 2-inch lengths) 1-2 minutes. ~Carrots (1/4-1/3-inch thick) 5 minutes. Put the vegetables in a bowl and chill: to stop cooking and to cool the potatoes enough so that they can be handled without crumbling. Slice the red potatoes 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Prepare the dressing in a blender, food processor, or hand-held grinder. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Drizzle on the salad and toss gently to coat. Fold in the tender shallot (or scallions; spring-green onions, sweet onion). Cover and chill (about 2 hours). Lettuce (optional). Cooksnote - substitute fresh rosemary for the basil. Use fresh herbs Published by Wisconsin Trails Magazine (1988). NOTES : Here's an eye-appealing potato salad from Wisconsin. Asparagus is grown there.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 pounds Headless shrimp</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Hot chili sauce</li>
      <li>6 ounces Tamarind cooking-----------</li>
      <li>3 ounces Young ginger root</li>
      <li>4 Large garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Blachan</li>
      <li>2 Small red onions</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dark soya sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Hot chili sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Packed brown sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>MARINATING: Break tamarind apart, place in a small saucepan with water. Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes or until pasty coating separates from seeds. Press through a sieve or food mill to extract all pulp and soupy liquid. Discard seeds. Rinse shrimps thoroughly, pat dry and marinate fro 1 hour with 1 tablespoon of this tamarind liquid, the oyster sauce and hot chili sauce. COOKING: Meanwhile, cut young ginger into toothpick-sized slivers. If using mature ginger, peel and sliver. Peel and sliver garlic. Place blachan in a non-stick pan and heat gently fro 3 to 4 minutes to develop the flavors. Pell and cut red onions into wedges. Combine oyster, soy and chili sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind liquid. Heat a large wok over high heat. When a drop of water sizzles immediately into steam pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Swirl up sides of wok, and when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and garlic. Stir fry until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. Adding more oil as needed, stir frey shrimp in batches until orange red, about 3 minutes. Pour sauces over all the shrimp in the wok and cook at a brisk bubble over high heat until shrimps are aromatic and sauces have reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells, about 8 minutes. Mix in sugar and onion wedges, taste to adjust seasoning, sweetening and spiciness. Makes plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice, enough for 8 with other dishes.

    <title>Asparagus with Oyster Sauce</title>
    <category>Vegetables</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Fresh asparagus -- 6 or 7</li>
      <li>Spears/person</li>
      <li>Fresh or frozen oysters --</li>
      <li>Allow 3 per person</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>20 grams Butter</li>
      <li>Salt, pepper, cayenne</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Another recipe courtesy of John Morris, butcher and caterer in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia, as discussed on ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corp.] Radio on Sunday 13 March 1994 in the "Queensland Sunday" programme. John opened the discussion by stating that this is NOT a Lenten meal ;-) (He recommended it for breakfast in bed on Sunday mornings in fact.) Allow 6 or 7 spears per person. Not too thin and not too old. Trim bottom 1" of the asparagus spears and peel the lower part if necessary (shouldn't be required if you've selected the bunches correctly and trimmed off the bottoms) then poach them gently - get about 1" of water boiling in a flat pan and lay the spears in it to cook for about 7 minutes (or use a European-style tall asparagus boiler if you must). Cut the oysters into thin strips rather than serving them as lumps. Reserve the juice from the oyster shells - should get about 2 tablespoon from 6 oysters. Mix this with the dry white wine and reduce over heat by about 2/3rds (i.e. you'll have about 1 1/2 tablespoon left). Add this liquor and about 4 tablespoon of the poaching water slowly to the egg yolks and whisk them over very low heat until light and frothy (note: do not have the liquor or the other fluid too hot when adding to the eggs - you don't want to curdle them). Add seasoning. Then draw the sauce together by adding 20 gram of *cold* diced butter and stirring it in gently. Add the oyster strips and fold through. Lay the freshly cooked asparagus spears on the serving plates and pour the oyster sauce over them (fairly now ;-).

    <recipetext>
      <li>"douglas allen thompson" &lt;aesculus@TSO.UC.EDU&gt; Mix cubed chicken with coconut milk, chili paste, peppers and cilantro. Allow to sit for at least an hour to absorb flavours. Then, taking a cube of chicken (or two, depending on size), center it in a wonton skin,gather the four corners of the skin with your fingers moistened in the cornstarch paste, and twirl the skin until the dumpling looks like a Hershey's Kiss. Allow these to rest on waxed paper or a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM. Deep fry these in sufficient oil to cover, a few at a time. I use peanut oil but anything that can take a high heat is fine. Olive oil smokes too much. Remove from hot oil when they float and are golden brown. Be careful, they cook very fast. I usually provide a peanut sauce to dip these in but they're fine by themselves I do not use exact measurements when I cook, so the above are only approximations of what I use. If it looks right, it probably will be fine. These work out great for parties, too. CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

Create a double boiler by setting a stainless steel bowl on top of a saucepan half-filled with barely simmering water over low heat. Whisk together yolks and sugar rapidly for 6 minutes, or until the yolks volume has doubled and their color has lightened. Whisk gelatin into warm sparkling wine. Whisk the mixture into the whipped yolks and place in the refrigerator to cool. In a separate chilled bowl, whip heavy cream to stiff peaks. When the wine mixture is cool to touch, fold in whipped cream until smooth and thoroughly combined. Place mixture in a sealed container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving. Serve warmed fruit compote -- apricot, peaches or nectarines -- in pretty glass dishes. Spoon semifreddo onto fruit. Garnish with mint sprigs and serve.

      <li>From: plgold@ix.netcom.com Date: 19 Oct 1995 21:16:48 -0600 Here is a recipe for Injeera and also 2 recipes for sauces from "Sephardic Cooking", Copeland Marks. In Ethiopia the injeera are prepared with teff, a grain of the millet family, but this recipe calls white flour. 1. Stir-fry the onion and garlic in a dry pan over moderately low heat for 2 minutes. Add the oil and stir-fry for 1 minute. 2. Add the mashed peas, tumeric, salt and chili; mix well. Add the water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to reduce the mixture to a thick, green, well-spiced puree. Serve warm with injeera (see recipe). Variation: If you substitute 1 cup of red Egyptian lentils for the green split peas and follow the same instructions, you will have Misr Allecha.

      <li>1/4 cups Parmesan cheese</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Beat eggs until light and creamy. Fold in crumbled Feta, cottage and Parmesan cheeses. Season with salt and pepper. Place half of pastry sheets in buttered 11x17 pan, brushing each pastry sheet individually with butter. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE WITH MARGARINE. Pour in cheese filling. Cover with remaining half of pastry sheets, brushing each with butter. Brush entire pie generously with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350ø for 45 minutes, or until golden.

Working with filo pastry is a little difficult, but this dish is very different and delicious so it's well worth the trouble. HELEN N. DAMASKOS (MRS.

    <title>Ass Kickin' Horseradish Cheese Log</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 ounces Chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>2 packages (8 oz. each) cream cheese - room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Cheddar cheese; finely grated</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Ass Kickin' Horseradish Hot Sauce</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>We tried a recipe for a cheese log off the back of a bottle of Ass Kickin Horseradish Hot Sauce. We devoured as much as possible on crackers last night. But I coudn't resist trying some on my toasted bagel for breakfast....mmmmm good. It would make an excellent snack for anyone contemplating a fourth of July party. Even though it calls for a specific hot sauce, I imagine other hot sauces could be used. The subtle horseradish flavor in this hot sauce did add a nice flavor to the cheese log though. In your food processor, blend cream cheese, cheddar cheese, hot sauce and 1/2 chopped nuts, mix until smooth. Divide in half, place onto plastic wrap and roll into a log shape. Refrigerate. Before serving, remove log fom plastic wrap and roll into the remainder of the chopped nuts. Serve with your favorite crackers and top with more hot sauce for spicier snack! Curt and I didn't feel that it was all that spicy. However, Curt's oldest daughter (Kelly) gave it a try and thought it was too spicy for her. Kelly is 14 and just beginning on her quest for enjoying spicy foods. Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #049 by "Curt Snyder, Hot's Desire" &lt;hotsdesr@deltanet.com&gt; on Jul 30, 1997</li>

      <li>8 ounces Piloncillo / brown sugar</li>

      <li>Dissolve the masa harina in 1 quart of water, then strain the water into a saucepan (throw away the masa). Boil until it is thick, stirring with a wooden spoon, about 15 minutes. Add the milk, piloncillo, vanilla, and canela. Bring the liquid back to a simmer, stirring often to thicken. This will take about 45 minutes, keeping the heat at a minimum so the milk doesn't curdle.

Proof, in a warm draft-free place, covered with a dish towel, until they are a little puffy and a finger pressed lightly into the dough leaves a slight indentation. Brush lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar or topping. Bake about 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a rack. While still warm, brush lightly with warm apricot glaze or drizzle with icing. Yield: 10 pastries Pinwheels: Spread with remonce. Sprinkle on some extra cinnamon sugar. Brush the of the square with egg wash. Cut a slit from each corner almost into the center, stopping just short of the center. Fold every other tip into the center, overlapping them, and press firmly. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Proof, covered, about 1/2 hour. Press the center down with your finger where the tips overlap and fill with 1/2 rounded teaspoon jam or filling. Eggwash, sprinkle with coarse sugar, and bake about 20 minutes, or until nicely colored. Envelopes: Spread square with remonce. Sprinkle with finely chopped chocolate mixed with sugar. Turn the square so that a point is at the top. Put and elongated mound of about 2 tablespoons of cheese filling from top to bottom. Egg wash the side corners. Fold one corner over the filling and press firmly. Fold the other end over the top and press very firmly to seal. Place on lined baking sheet and proof, covered, about 1/2 hour. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar and chopped chocolate. Bake about 20 minutes, or until nicely browned. (Or spread with lemon curd and then cheese filling and garnish before baking with toasted sliced almonds.) Cheese pockets: Spread the square with remonce. Place a rounded tablespoon of cheese filling in the middle of the square. Brush the corners with egg wash. Fold two opposite sides up and press firmly, as in the envelopes above. Bring the bottom corner up and press firmly over the fold. Lastly, bring the top corner up and across the fold and pinch it to seal. Proof, covered, as above. Egg wash and sprinkle the top with streusel. Bake about 25 minutes, until nicely browned. Turnovers: Spread with remonce. Place a big dollop of chunky homemade applesauce or pearsauce on one side of the square. Egg wash the edges and fold over into a triangle. Press around the edge with a fork to seal. Proof, etc. Before baking, egg wash and sprinkle with coarse or pearl sugar.

      <li>From: Doreen Randal &lt;ynnuf@yetti.wanganui.gen.nz&gt; Date: Mon, 16 Oct 1995 13:21:59 GMT This maybe served with coffee or as a dessert. Pre-heat the oven to 350 F. Grease a med-sized loaf or cake tin with a little butter and dust with flour. In a med-sized mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with a wooden spoon until they are well cream. Separate the yolks from the whites aside. Add the yolks, one at a time, to the creamed butter and sugar and mix thoroughly. Beat the egg whites until they are stiff. Add half the egg whites and the cinnamon to the creamed mixture and mix well. Set aside 2 Tbs of the crushed walnuts. Mix the rest off the walnuts and flour together and gradually to the creamed mixture, mixing thoroughly. Fold in the remaining egg whites. Put the mixture in the loaf or cake tin and sprinkle the top with the remaining 2 Tbs of crushed walnuts. Bake for 1 1/4 hrs. or until the cake is cooked when a skewer comes out dry when tested. If skewer is clean the cake is done. Remove the cake from the tin and place it upside down in a deep dish. With a skewer, pierce the bottom of the cake all over. Pour the hot syrup slowly over the cake while it is still hot. TO MAKE THE SYRUP, dissolve the sugar in the water in a small saucepan over a low heat and boil rapidly until the syrup thickens. Remove from the heat and mix in the brandy. Set the cake aside to cool and to absorb the syrup. Turn tne cake right side up and serve cold.

      <li>Juice and zest of 2 oranges</li>
      <li>1/4 cups White wine</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Minced shallots</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Heavy cream</li>

      <li>2 pounds Asparagus</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a small saucepan combine orange juice, wine and shallots and bring to a boil over medium heat. When liquids have reduced by half, add cream. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to very low. Add butter, a few small pieces at a time, whisking constantly. Add more butter just as last pieces melt, and continue whisking until all butter is added. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside in a warm but not hot place. Meanwhile, bring a deep saucepan of salted water to a boil. If asparagus are tough, peel stems before cooking. For a pretty presentation, line up tips and chop stems to same length. Tie asparagus loosely together in two or three bunches with two pieces of butchers' twine each. Add asparagus bundles to pot, stem ends down, and boil until you can squeeze a piece between your fingers and it is tender but not soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, remove strings and place on a serving platter. Drizzle orange sauce over and sprinkle with orange zest. This recipe yields 4 servings.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Lobsters (about 2 lbs each) (live, or recently dead)</li>
      <li>25 Saffron strands; soaked in</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Hot water</li>
      <li>1/4 pounds Finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 medium Leek; washed, finely chopped</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons Fruity olive oil</li>
      <li>3 Garlic cloves; minced</li>
      <li>1 pound Tomatoes; skinned, seeded, and finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 Sun-dried tomatoes (in oil) pounded to a paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cups White wine</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Orange juice</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>Salt &amp; freshly ground Pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Finely chopped Fennel</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Minced flat-leaf Parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Finely chopped fresh Mint</li>
      <li>Saffron Rice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water for 1 minute, then into cold water. To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with a hammer. Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever the tail where it joins the head with a heavy knife. Cut the tail into rings, slicing through the shell between the ribs. Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove and discard the gritty stomach sac. Pour the coral (if any) and the green matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and reserve. Put the saffron to soak. In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce, fry the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until translucent. Add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and liquid, wine, orange juice, and bay leaf. Season and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail pieces and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the strainer and beat the pur‚e with the remaining olive oil. When the lobster has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and beat this into the coral pur‚e. Pour this back into the pot, stir, and simmer for another 10 minutes. Serve with saffron rice. Source: Recipes from a Greek Island - by Susie Jacobs ISBN: 0-671-74531-X Typed for you by Karen Mintzias Sent to me by Bill &lt;wight@odc.net&gt;</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 package Dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Warm water</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>13 ounces Can evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Oil</li>
      <li>4 To 4 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes 1 large loaf Dissolve yeast in the warm water in large mixing bowl. Blend in the ginger and 1 Tbsp of the honey. Let stand in a warm place until the mixture is bubbly (about 15 minutes). Stir in the remaining honey, and the milk, salt, and oil. With mixer on low speed (or with a wooden spoon) beat in the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. If you are using amixer, beat in the last cup of flour with a wooden spoon. The dough should be heavy but too sticky to knead. Place dough in a 2-pound, WELL-GREASED coffee can. Cover with greased plastic lid. At this point, you may freeze the dough if you want to and bake it at a later time. To bake, let stand, covered in a warm place until the dough rises and pops off the lid. This will take 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Discard the lid and bake at 350 F for 1 hour. The crust will be very brown. Brush the top lightly with butter. Let the entire bread and can cool for 5 to 10 minutes on a wire rack, then loosen the crust around the edge of the can with a thin knife and slide the bread from the can. Cool it in an upright position on the wire rack. VARIATION: Add to the yeast mixture 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. With the final addition of flour, add 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.

      <li>3 ounces Tortilla masa (1/3 cup)</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar, brown; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Though there are many variations, basically "atole" is a gruel thickened with masa, sweetened with raw sugar, and flavored with crushed fruits - such as pineapple and strawberries - or seasoned with chili. Some are made with a base of ground rice; others with fresh corn. For the Mexicans atole, too, is a natural accompaniment for tamales. For non-Mexicans, however, it is really not the sort of beverage that would generally be accepted, no matter how authentic. Blackberry atole Put the blackberries and water into a saucepan and cook over a medium flame, pressing them down from time to time, for about 10 minutes. Puree the blackberries in a blender or food processor and press through a fine sieve, or the fine disk of a food mill, to extract the seeds, and return to the pan. Add the water to the masa and press out any lumps with the back of a wooded spoon. When it is quite smooth, stir it into the strained blackberries. Cook over low heat, stirring often until the atole begins to thicken. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. It should take about 25 minutes to reach the required consistency, so that the mixture will very lightly coat the back of a wooden spoon. Champurrado (Chocolate-flavored atole) Put the masa into the pan with the 2/3 cup water and cook over a low flame, stirring constantly, until it thickens - about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the milk and water and cook until it begins to bubble. Add the chocolate, broken into pieces, the cinnamon stick, and the sugar and cook slowly, stirring, until the mixture thickens - about 15 minutes. The atole is done when a spoonful slides noiselessly rather than plops back into the mixture.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Jim Vorheis</li>
      <li>2 pounds Wild blackberries</li>
      <li>2 cups Cold water</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cold water</li>
      <li>3 ounces Tortilla masa (1/3 cup)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Crushed piloncillo or dark brown sugar to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Prepared tortilla masa, or scant 1/2 cup masa harina mixed with 1/3 cup water</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Warm milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Warm water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 ounces Tablet drinking chocolate</li>
      <li>1 3-inch cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Brown sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Though there are many variations, basically "atole" is a gruel thickened with masa, sweetened with raw sugar, and flavored with crushed fruits - such as pineapple and strawberries - or seasoned with chili. Some are made with a base of ground rice; others with fresh corn. For the Mexicans atole, too, is a natural accompaniment for tamales. For non-Mexicans, however, it is really not the sort of beverage that would generally be accepted, no matter how authentic. Blackberry atole Put the blackberries and water into a saucepan and cook over a medium flame, pressing them down from time to time, for about 10 minutes. Puree the blackberries in a blender or food processor and press through a fine sieve, or the fine disk of a food mill, to extract the seeds, and return to the pan. Add the water to the masa and press out any lumps with the back of a wooded spoon. When it is quite smooth, stir it into the strained blackberries. Cook over low heat, stirring often until the atole begins to thicken. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. It should take about 25 minutes to reach the required consistency, so that the mixture will very lightly coat the back of a wooden spoon. Champurrado (Chocolate-flavored atole) Put the masa into the pan with the 2/3 cup water and cook over a low flame, stirring constantly, until it thickens - about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the milk and water and cook until it begins to bubble. Add the chocolate, broken into pieces, the cinnamon stick, and the sugar and cook slowly, stirring, until the mixture thickens - about 15 minutes. The atole is done when a spoonful slides noiselessly rather than plops back into the mixture.

      <li>Notes: From Houston (Texas) Chronicle files. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan. Mash bananas in a bowl and add dry cake mix, eggs, vanilla and nuts. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer. Pour into prepared pan and bake 1 hour or until cake tests done. Gibson says she finds the recipe is too much batter for one pan so she divides it between two loaf pans. Cake with pudding mix included also may be used, she said.

    <quantity>30</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter; sweet, melted</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Brandy</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Almond extract</li>
      <li>1 cup Almonds; unsalted, chopped</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350. Mix sugar with butter, brandy, vanilla, almond extract, nuts and eggs. Mix well. Stir in flour, baking powder and salt. Form into a long loaf (or loaves), place on a cookie sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes or until firm and softly cakelike. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, slice into 1/2 inch diagonal slices and return to cookie sheet. Bake for 15-25 minutes, turning once, until both sides are brown-flecked and toasted. Cool thoroughly and store in an airtight jar. Makes 2-3 dozen. Variation 1 (Mandlebrot): increase sugar to 1-1/4 cups. Diced dried apricots may by added. Variation 2: for a clasic anise-flavored biscotto, substitute Pernod, Ouzo or Anisette for the brandy &amp; omit the almond extract. Several tablespoons of anise seeds may be added for additional oomph. Variation 3 (Hazelnut biscotti): use hazelnuts in place of almonds. A hazelnut liqueur may be used instead of brandy. Omit the almond extract. Variation 4 (Mediterranean biscotti): use rosewater instead of brandy. Substitute unsalted pistachio nuts for the almonds, and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup diced figs to the dough. Variation 5 (Ginger-flavored biscotti): to the basic dough, add 1 Tbsp powdered ginger, a generous dash of cloves and cinnamon, 1 or 2 Tbsp of candied ginger and 1/4 cup raisins, if desired. Omit the almond extract. Variation 6 (Paximatha): this Greek rusk dates back to the 5th century, virtually unchanged. Substiture 1/2 - 3/4 cup toasted sesame seeds for the almonds. Omit the almond extact &amp; flavor the dough with 1 tsp cinnamon &amp; 1/2 tsp cloves. Variation 7; Pine nuts may be used instead of almonds, though the richness may be less desirable than the crunch of the toasted almonds. Candied fruits, too, may be added, 1/4 to 1/2 cup assorted fruits blended into the dough before baking. Variation 8 (Chocolate Dipped): melt 1/2 pound semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just simmering water. If it "seizes" or "tightens", add 2 Tbsp of unsalted buter and it should smooth out again. Dip only one side of each cookie (the chocolate won't seal in the moisture that way).

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk</li>
      <li>1 Eggs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>8 ounces Almond paste; 1/8" slices</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Flour; not bread flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar, brown</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Yeast</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GLAZE</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Syrup, corn</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Water; warm</li>
      <li>Almonds, slivered</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Unless the instructions that came with your ABM call for putting the yeast in the pan first and incorporating the liquid ingredients last, pour the milk into the baking pan of your ABM and break in the egg. If the butter is not soft, cut it into small chunks to ensure its blending into the dough, then add it to the liquids. Next add the almond paste, sliced so it will blend better too. Measure in the flour, brown sugar, and salt, and add the yeast as directed for your bread maker. You can use your machine's full cycle with this bread, but the quick cycle is better. If a light color setting is available, use it as well. As soon as the bread has finished baking, remove it from the machine, closing the cover again, and ease the loaf from the pan. Combine the corn syrup and warm water and brush the top of the loaf with this mixture, using a pastry brush. Sprinkle the slivered almonds over the glaze, put the bread gently back in its pan, and return it to the electronic oven for a few minutes to dry the glaze a bit.

    <category>Cookies: bi</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 large Eggs Separated</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cups (5 1/3 Tablespoons) Butter; melted and cooled</li>
      <li>1 cup Lightly Toasted And Coarsely Chopped Almon</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Raisins; * see note</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chopped Candied Orange Peel &lt;&lt;Or&gt;&gt;</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Orange Zest; grated</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 Butter a baking sheet or line it with parchment. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup of the sugar until light and the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the melted butter, almonds, raisins and orange peel. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they just begin to form peaks and gradually beat in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar until the whites form stiff peaks. Sift the flour and baking powder together. Fold in 1/3 of the flour into the yolks; then fold 1/3 of the egg whites in. Repeat, alternating, until well combined. The dough will be firm and slightly sticky. If the dough is too soft, add more flour. With floured hands, divide the dough into two logs approximately 1 1/2 inches wide. Arrange the logs on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until they are lightly brown and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and set the baking sheet on a rack for 10 minutes. On a cutting board, cut the logs on a diagonal into slices 1/2 inch wide. Return the slices to the baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until the biscotti are very lightly browned and crisp. Cool on racks and store in airtight containers. Yield: About 36 biscotti NOTES : *Plump raisins in 2/3 C fruity white wine such as Reisling or Geworztraminer. Drain.

      <li>From: waring@infomail.com (Sam Waring) (COLLECTION) Date: 12 Apr 1994 15:17:00 -0400 Preheat oven to 350~. Mix sugar with butter, brandy, vanilla, almond extract, nuts and eggs. Mix well. Stir in flour, baking powder and salt. Form into a long loaf (or loaves), place on a cookie sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes or until firm and softly cakelike. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, slice into 1/2 inch diagonal slices and return to cookie sheet. Bake for 15-25 miutes, turning once, until both sides are brown-flecked and toasted. Cool thoroughly and store in an airtight jar. Makes 2-3 dozen. Variation 1 (Mandlebrot): increase sugar to 1-1/4 cups. Diced dried apricots may by added. Variation 2: for a clasic anise-flavored biscotto, substitute Pernod, Ouzo or Anisette for the brandy and omit the almond extract. Several tablespoons of anise seeds may be added for additional oomph. Variation 3 (Hazelnut biscotti): use hazelnuts in place of almonds. A hazelnut liqueur may be used instead of brandy. Omit the almond extract. Variation 4 (Mediterranean biscotti): use rosewater instead of brandy. Substitute unsalted pistachio nuts for the almonds, and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup diced figs to the dough. Variation 5 (Ginger-flavored biscotti): to the basic dough, add 1 Tbsp powdered ginger, a generous dash of cloves and cinnamon, 1 or 2 Tbsp of candied ginger and 1/4 cup raisins, if desired. Omit the almond extract. Variation 6 (Paximatha): this Greek rusk dates back to the 5th century, virtually unchanged. Substiture 1/2 to 3/4 cup toasted sesame seeds for the almonds. Omit the almond extact and flavor the dough with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves. Variation 7 (Fekkas): a Moroccon twice-baked cookie. Substitute orange flower water for the brandy. Variation 8; Pine nuts may be used instead of almonds, though the richness may be less desirable than the crunch of the toasted almonds. Candied fruits, too, may be added, 1/4 to 1/2 cup assorted fruits blended into the dough before baking. Variation 9 (Chocolate Dipped): melt 1/2 pound semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just simmering water. If it "seizes" or "tightens", add 2 Tbsp of unsalted buter and it should smooth out again. Dip only one side of each cookie (the chocolate won't seal in the moisture that way).

      <li>The mild flavor of almonds is the perfect complement to vibrant Asian flavors. Try tossing finely diced toasted almonds into a ginger-shrimp saute' or adding toasted whole natural almonds to Chinese. More tasty ideas. Whether you're serving salad or soup, pasta or poultry, almonds are a natural and healthful addition to any menu. With their excellent nutritional profile, almonds can be a part of an overall balanced diet. Here are some heart-healthy tips for incorporating wholesome, crunchy almonds into your diet: Make "nut crumbs" by adding whole toasted almonds to the bowl of a food processor and pulsing on and off until the almonds are coarsely ground. Use them as a wholesome gratin topping for casseroles, or sprinkle on pasta and grain dishes. Bursting with flavor, savory seasoned almonds are the perfect topping for your favorite side or main dish. In a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, toss whole natural or slivered almonds in a small amount of vegetable oil until golden. Add your choice of dried herbs, then sprinkle over salads, vegetables and pasta. Mix toasted slivered or sliced almonds into grain-based dishes, such as Middle Eastern classic tabbouleh or other bulgur wheat salads to add flavor, nutrition and crunch. Or pair them with quinoa, hailed as the "super grain of the future" for its healthful nutrition profile. The mild flavor of almonds is the perfect complement to vibrant Asian flavors. Try tossing finely diced toasted almonds into a ginger-shrimp saute or adding toasted whole natural almonds to Chinese vegetable stir-fry dishes. Almond butter is a nutritious and hearty topping for bagels or muffins. And, it's easy to make at home by chopping whole natural almonds in a food processor with a little vegetable oil, salt and sugar until almost smooth. Visual appeal is important in low-fat cooking. Make a prudent parfait look sinful by layering frozen yogurt, pureed frozen berries and toasted sliced almonds in an elegant stemmed glass. Or, make individual trifles by adding layers of cubed angel food cake. Garnish with sprigs of mint, sliced almonds or whole berries, and serve with almond biscotti. The buttery flavor and crunchy texture of almonds make them a perfect topper for freshly baked low-fat scones and breads. Before baking scones, brush them with milk or egg white and top with slivered or chopped almonds. And for extra special quick breads sprinkle chopped almonds on them before baking, or knead toasted chopped or slivered almonds into yeast bread dough. To give hot cereal just a little more panache, mix in dried cranberries or cherries and a generous amount of chopped toasted almonds just before serving. Serve with skim milk and a drizzle of maple syrup. Satisfy your palate while watching your waistline by steaming your favorite fresh fish and vegetables and sprinkling them with toasted, sliced almonds. Serve with wedges of lemon or lime. You get all the flavor and all the benefits of a healthy, low-fat meal. Plain roasted chicken is enhanced by stuffing it with diced apples, onions, garlic, herbs and coarsely chopped, toasted whole almonds.

      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>

      <li>1 cup Coarsely chopped almonds or other nuts</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon; (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and set a rack in the middle level. Line a jelly-roll pan or cookie sheet with parchment or foil. In a mixing bowl, whisk eggs and salt until liquid. Whisk in sugar and vanilla smoothly. Whisk in butter or oil, then stir in nuts. Combine flour with baking powder and cinnamon and stir with a dry whisk to mix. Fold flour mixture into egg mixture until all the flour is absorbed - the dough will be very soft. Use a spoon to form two logs of dough on the prepared pan, adjusting the sides with the tip of the spoon to make the logs even. Bake the logs of dough about 30 minutes, or until well risen and firm when pressed with a fingertip. Cool on pan to room temperature. Slice baked logs diagonally about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick, using a sharp serrated knife. Return biscotti to pan, cut side down, and bake up to 20 minutes longer, or until biscotti are a deep golden color. Cool on pan and store in a tin. Yield: 5 dozen or more, depending on how thinly they are sliced.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Put 1/2 cup lime in about 1 gallon of boiling water and scald quickly, and pull off hair while hot. Scrape well--remove feet, tail, and entrails--like you would a pig. Cut off ears, remove eyes and head if desired. Pour hot water over it and clean thoroughly. Put one cup salt in sufficient cold water to cover possum, add 1 pod red pepper and let stand overnight. In the morning remove salt water and pour boiling water over it. Cook in enough boiling water to boil up over possum but not enough to cover. Cook until skin can be pierced with a fork easily, and let stand in water until ready for baking. When ready to bake, place possum in pan with skin side up. Bake in a moderate oven until crisp and brown. If fire is too hot, skin will blister and burn. Carve possum and surround with potatoes (sliced or quartered) which have been previously baked. 192 DULL, Mrs. S.R.

      <li>Place the almonds in a food processor. Process until very finely ground. Continue to process until the mixture almost resembles a nut butter, stopping the machine and scraping down the sides with a plastic spatula from time to time. Heat the oil in a soup pot. Add the onion and saute over medium heat until it is golden. Add the celery, garlic, potato, wine, tomato, and about two thirds of the brussels sprouts (reserve and set aside the remainder). Add enough water to barely cover the vegetables. Bring to a simmer, then add the almond butter and seasoning mix. Simmer gently, covered, over low heat for 35 to 40 minutes or until all the vegetables are tender. Remove from the heat. Transfer the solid ingredients to a food processor and puree, in batches if necessary, until smooth. Transfer back to the soup pot and return to low heat. Thin with a small amount of water if the soup is too thick. In a separate saucepan, steam the reserved brussels sprouts in about 1/2 inch of water until they are bright green and crisp-tender. Add them to the soup along with lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve the soup at once, or allow to stand for an hour or so before serving, then heat through as needed. Garnish each serving with some chopped or slivered almonds if desired and fresh parsley. Calories: 164; Total fat: 8 g; Protein: 4 g; Carbohydrate: 16 g; Cholestetol: 0 g; Sodium: 31 mg.

      <li>1 teaspoon Almond extract</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Finely chopped almonds</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Combine the flours, sugar, and baking powder, and stir to mix well. Use a pastry cutter to cut in the margarine or butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray, and place the logs on the sheet, leaving 4 inches of space between the logs to allow for spreading. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. 3. Cool the logs at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then use a serrated knife to slice the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. 4. Place the slices on an ungreased baking sheet in a single layer, cut side down. Bake at 350 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes, or until dry and crisp, turning the slices after 10 minutes. 5. Transfer the biscotti to wire racks, and cool completely.

      <li>1 3/4 pounds Baklava phyllo leaves</li>
      <li>4 cups Almond crumbs</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Honey</li>
      <li>1 Stick cinnamon</li>
      <li>5 Whole cloves; up to 6</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Blanch then chop the almonds. Mix them with the sugar and cinnamon. Brush a medium size baking pan with melted butter. Lay 4 baklava phyllo leaves in the pan, buttering each beforehand. Lay more phyllo on top, this time without buttering them. Sprinkle with chopped almonds. Lay in another layer of phyllo, this time burshing with butter. Sprinkle with almonds. Continue laying in phyllo leaves and crushed almonds in the same way, until only five phyllo leaves remain. Brush these last phyllo leaves very well with butter and lay on the top. Cut away any phyllo ends overlapping the sides of the pan with a sharp knife. With the same knife, cut through the top phyllo leaves, scoring serving size squares in the baklava. Dip your fingers in a dish of water andsprinkle the top layer of phyllo leaves. Put the baklava in a moderate oven to bake for almost one hour. Meanwhile, boil the sugar in the water for five minutes. Add the honey and spices and boil for five minutes more. Remove the spices and keep the syrup hot. Take the baklava from the oven and let it cool. Pour the syrup over the baklava. After it cools, cut the baklava completely through and serve the pieces on a platter. NOTES : 1. For Walnut Baklava: 1. Replace almonds with walnuts. 2. Syrup uses 3 1/2 cups sugar and 1 1/2 cups honey. 2. The baklava can also be made with half walnuts and half almonds.

      <li>250 grams Caster sugar</li>
      <li>6 Eggs, separated</li>
      <li>300 grams Fresh ricotta cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Makes 1 x 25.5cm/10 in cake. 1. Preheat oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Butter a 25.5cm/10in round cake tin and line with greaseproof paper. 2. Coarsely chop the almonds in a food processor. Combine with the flour and lemon zest. 3. Beat the butter and sugar together in a mixer until pale and light. Add the egg yolks one by one, then add the almond mixture. 4. Put the ricotta in a bowl and lightly beat with a fork. Add the lemon juice. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold the egg whites into the almond mixture and finally stir in the ricotta. 5. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes until set. Test by inserting a skewer, which should come out clean. Remove from tin while warm, and cool on a rack. NOTES : Go on - just a slice. To serve any time, but especially as a new-style pudding. Ricotta is a fresh, soft, mild cheese, traditionally made fro mthe whey left behind when the curds had been used for other cheeses. It's not so rich as mascarpone, and often used in cooking, as a filling for pasta or for sweet or savoury tarts.

      <li>2 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan. Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and grind until a fine meal is formed--the flour will prevent the nuts from turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt and 2 teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly. Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2- cup measuring cup. With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining poppy seeds, and bake for 55 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread slices best after several hours, or the next day). Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).

      <li>In a small mixing bowl soften yeast in warm water; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, stir together flour, whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, salt, and the 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (or cardomom). Cut in the cold butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in the softened yeast, eggs, milk and almond extract until combined. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours or until dough is easy to handle. For filling: Stir together ground almonds, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon allspice (or cardomom); set aside. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 3 portions. Shape each into a ball. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Gently roll out each piece of dough to a 10" circle. Place one circle on a 12" pizza pan or a large baking sheet lined with greased foil. Brush with half of the melted butter. Sprinkle with half of the filling. Cover with another circle of dough. Brush with remaining butter; sprinkle with remaining filling. Top with the last dough circle. With kitchen shears or a sharp knife, cut the stack of dough into 12 wedges, cutting to within 1" of the center. Carefully lift each wedge and turn over twice to create a twist in each piece. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 2 to 24 hours before baking. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before baking. If desired, brush with milk; sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake in a 350 oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped. Cool slightly on foil on a rack. Serve warm. To serve, transfer bread to a serving platter; cut into wedges.

Butter and flour a tart tin with a removable base 22 cm in diameter. Roll out the pastry to fit the tart tin. Line the tin with the pastry and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake it for 10 minutes at the bottom of the pre-heated oven. Leave the pastry shell in the tin. Cooking: Lightly brush a thin layer of apricot glaze over the bottom of the pastry shell. Put all the remaining ingredients for the filling into a saucepan and heat them gently, stirring to mix them well as they melt. Raise the oven to 210 oC. When the filling is melted, spread it in a thin layer on the glazed pastry shell. Cook it for about 15 minutes: it is ready when the filling begins to bubble. Leave the cake to cool in its tin, then take it out. Serving: Cut the cake into little triangles or rectangular pieces. Serve them with coffee, like 'petits fours'.

      <li>Unless the instructions that came with your ABM call for putting the yeast in the pan first and incorporating the liquid ingredients last, pour the milk into the baking pan of your ABM and break in the egg. If the butter is not soft, cut it into small chunks to ensure its blending into the dough, then add it to the liquids. Next add the almond paste, slicced so it will blend better too. Measure in the flour, brown sugar, and salt, and add the yeast as directed for your bread maker. You can use your machine's full cycle with this bread, but the quick cycle is better. If a light color setting is available, use it as well. As soon as the bread has finished baking, remove it from the machine, closing the cover again, and ease the loaf from the pan. Combine the corn syrup and warm water and brush the top of the loaf with this mixture, using a pastry brush. Sprinkle the slivered almonds over the glaze, put the bread gently back in its pan, and return it to the electronic oven for a few minutes to dry the glaze a bit.

They're from an article by Jacqueline Mallorca in the Chron. For those to whom it is important, she's working on a book about wheat-free baking. No hint as to the release date though. Preheat oven to 350F. Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan. Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and grind until a fine meal is formed++the flour will prevent the nuts from turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt and 2 teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly. Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2-cup measuring cup. With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining poppy seeds, and bake for 55 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread slices best after several hours, or the next day). Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).

      <li>Use two cups of blanched whole almonds. If only unblanched almonds are available, blanch them this way: Place the almonds in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to boiling, then drain. The skins should slip off easily when you press each almond between your thumb and forefinger. Dry on paper towels. Spread the dry almonds in a shallow baking pan and toast in a 300 degree oven for about 20 minutes or until golden. Cool for 5 minutes before processing or blending. To process: Place the steel blade in your food processor or blender. Add the nuts. Cover and process or blend until a butter forms, stopping occasionally to scrape the sides of the bowl or blender a few times. Keep processing for three to five minutes or until all of the mixture is evenly blended. Process about two minutes more or until the butter is the desired smoothness.Store in a covered container in your refrigerator for up to two weeks. Bring to room temperature for easier spreading.

      <li>Add 1/2 cup orange juice, egg, butter, salt, bread flour, sugar and yeast to a bread machine according to manufacturer's directions. Select dough cycle. When dough cycle is complete, remove dough from machine. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 24" x 8" rectangle. In a small mixing bowl, stir together the almond filling, almonds, and orange peel. Spread filling over dough to within 1/2" of the edges. Fold dough loosely from a short side, making about eight 3" wide folds. (This is similar to making a jelly roll, except you make folds 3" wide, instead of rolling it.) Transfer to a lightly greased baking sheet. On one of the long sides, make eleven 2 1/2" cuts from the edge toward the center at about 3/4" intervals. Flip every other strip of dough over to the alternate side. Slightly twist each strip, exposing the filling. (The loaf will look braided when you are done flipping and twisting!) Bake in a 350 oven for 25 to 30 minutes of until golden brown. If necessary, cover loosely with foil during the last 5 to 10 minutes to prevent overbrowning. Lightly brush the bread surface with orange juice. Sprinkle with sugar. Serve warm.

Put the almonds with their soaking water in the container of an electric blender, and finely puree. Strain the almond milk through a double layer of cheesecloth into a small bowl, squeezing the cloth to extract as much almond milk as possible. This will yield 2/3 cup. 3. Combine the milk, light cream, and sugar in a heavy bottomed saucepan, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. As the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat. Give the rice and almond milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat. Give the rice and almond mixture a stir, because rice flour has a tendency to separate from the liquid and settle at the bottom. Add it to the milk and cream in the saucepan in a steady, slow stream, stirring rapidly with a wire whisk to prevent lumping. Cook over low heat until the mixture thickens and a thin custard is formed on the spoon. Continue cooking the custard, uncovered, for an additional 5 minutes. The custard should be quite thin. As it chills, it will thicken considerably. (If the custard should accidentally stick and burn, turn off the heat, and immediately pour it into another saucepan. DO NOT SCRAPE OUT THE BURNT RESIDUE; it will release the burnt-custard smell and texture into the pudding. 4. Cool the custard thoroughly. Check to make sure there are no lumps. If there are, pass the custard through a fine sieve. (Do not blend it in the electric blender or food processor, or it will become runny.) Stir in the rose water, cover, and refrigerate to chill thoroughly. A skin will form on the custard. No need for alarm. Simply stir it in with a wire whisk. To serve, pour into individual dessert dishes, sprinkle with chopped almonds and pistachios, and place a teaspoon of pomegranate or a strawberry in the center. Note: This dessert can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 4 days. It does not freeze well at all.

      <li>If you stick to well-balanced, healthy eating on a regular basis, then giving into a craving when it strikes is not only permitted, but is encouraged. The nutritional profile of almonds allows you to incorporate them into a healthy diet, and their wonderful flavor and texture makes those decadent foods that much more special. So, with "everything in moderation" as your motto--indulge! Your favorite prepared cheesecake can be dressed for success by covering the top with toasted, slivered or chopped almonds. Simply sprinkle the almonds over the top of the cake to cover, and press down lightly. A fabulous marriage of textures and tastes! If the spirit moves you once in a while, indulge in a hot fudge sundae. Top it off with a generous amount of toasted slivered almonds. You can choose decadent fudge sauce and ice cream or go with the low fat versions. Either way, the crisp almonds make it a memorable treat. To make surprisingly delicious and crunchy "croutons," heat your oven to 350 degrees, then toss 2/3 cup slivered almonds with 2 teaspoons olive oil in a shallow baking pan; arrange almonds in a single layer in pan and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt before baking 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown, tossing once. Cool, and toss the "croutons" with green salads just before serving, or sprinkle on steamed vegetables.

Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and grind until a fine meal is formed--the flour will prevent the nuts from turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt and 2 teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly. Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2- cup measuring cup. With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining poppy seeds, and bake for 55 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread slices best after several hours, or the next day). Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).

    <category>Cookies</category>
    <quantity>30</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter, sweet; melted</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Brandy</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Almond extract</li>
      <li>1 cup Almonds, unsalted; chopped</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoons Baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350~. Mix sugar with butter, brandy, vanilla, almond extract, nuts and eggs. Mix well. Stir in flour, baking powder and salt. Form into a long loaf (or loaves), place on a cookie sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes or until firm and softly cakelike. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, slice into 1/2 inch diagonal slices and return to cookie sheet. Bake for 15-25 miutes, turning once, until both sides are brown-flecked and toasted. Cool thoroughly and store in an airtight jar. Makes 2-3 dozen. Variation 1 (Mandlebrot): increase sugar to 1-1/4 cups. Diced dried apricots may by added. Variation 2: for a clasic anise-flavored biscotto, substitute Pernod, Ouzo or Anisette for the brandy and omit the almond extract. Several tablespoons of anise seeds may be added for additional oomph. Variation 3 (Hazelnut biscotti): use hazelnuts in place of almonds. A hazelnut liqueur may be used instead of brandy. Omit the almond extract. Variation 4 (Mediterranean biscotti): use rosewater instead of brandy. Substitute unsalted pistachio nuts for the almonds, and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup diced figs to the dough. Variation 5 (Ginger-flavored biscotti): to the basic dough, add 1 Tbsp powdered ginger, a generous dash of cloves and cinnamon, 1 or 2 Tbsp of candied ginger and 1/4 cup raisins, if desired. Omit the almond extract. Variation 6 (Paximatha): this Greek rusk dates back to the 5th century, virtually unchanged. Substiture 1/2 to 3/4 cup toasted sesame seeds for the almonds. Omit the almond extact and flavor the dough with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves. Variation 7 (Fekkas): a Moroccon twice-baked cookie. Substitute orange flower water for the brandy. Variation 8; Pine nuts may be used instead of almonds, though the richness may be less desirable than the crunch of the toasted almonds. Candied fruits, too, may be added, 1/4 to 1/2 cup assorted fruits blended into the dough before baking. Variation 9 (Chocolate Dipped): melt 1/2 pound semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just simmering water. If it "seizes" or "tightens", add 2 Tbsp of unsalted buter and it should smooth out again. Dip only one side of each cookie (the chocolate won't seal in the moisture that way).</li>

Roll horns carefully in the almonds and place them on baking paper (parchment paper) on a cookie sheet. Bake horns for 10-12 minutes at 200 C (400 F). Melt chocolate in a double boiler and dip the ends of the horns in the warm chocolate. Place horns on parchment paper and allow chocolate to cool and solidify. Makes about 20 horns. NOTE: If desired, you could brush the unbaked almond horns with an eggwhite/sugar wash to make them shiny and a little sweeter. I don't, but it is always an option.

      <li>From: "Marian Russell" &lt;mrussell@sgit.iaea.or.at&gt; Date: 3 May 1995 07:34:25 -0600 After 20 years of carrying around a recipe I cut out of a newspaper, I tried making almond paste and almond macaroons. The newspaper recipe was TOO SWEET and not specific enough about how to make the dough (the cookies were too thin and dry). This is the updated recipe and, if I do say so myself, it's quite good! The cookies are chewy and taste like the best almond macaroons I've ever eaten anywhere else. 1. Soften almond paste with the back of a tablespoon and work in the dry ingredients. Mix well. 2. Begin adding egg whites, preparing them one at a time in case you don't need all of them. Blend well after each addition. Use only enough egg white to make a soft dough that will HOLD ITS SHAPE when dropped from a spoon. 3. Drop 2 inches apart on a brown-paper-covered baking sheet. Pat tops lightly with fingers dipped in cold water. 4. Bake at 150 degrees C (300 degrees F) for 18 to 20 minutes, or until set and delicately browned. 5. Remove from paper with a spatula onto wire racks to cool. Almond Paste: 1. Combine the ground almonds with the sugar, then blend in the egg whites and almond extract. 2. Mold into a ball and age for four days in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator. Note: If you have 1/2 cup of egg whites and you don't want to throw the extra 1/4 cup away, simply use the whole 1/2 cup for this recipe and add fewer egg whites for the almond macaroons.

      <li>From: yu105639@laurel.yorku.ca (William Ing) Date: 29 Dec 1994 13:11:41 -0500 From Marcel Desaulniers' Death By Chocolate; The last word on a consumming Passion. This recipe starts is divided into two parts; Almond Meringue Crisps for the base and a Chocolate Ganache as the topping. Equipment: Measuring spoons, 2 baking sheets, food processor with metal blade, electric mixer with balloon whisk, rubber spatual, greasproof paper, piping bag, double boiler, cling film, whisk, 2 pint/1.5L saucepan, small stainless steel bowl, medium star nozzle..... or equivalent. Preheat oven to 325F/170C/Gas 3. Lightly toast almonds on a baking sheet in oven for 5 minutes. Let cool to room temp. Reduce oven temp to 225F/100F/ Gas 1/4 Coarsely process toasted almonds with 1oz/28g sugar into 1/8" size pieces and set aside until needed. Line two baking sheets with greaseproof paper. Create meringue by whisking egg whites on medium speed with balloon whick until frothy (approx 1 min). Add cream of tartar and salt and increase speed to high until whites begin to stiffen, then gradually add 4oz/113g caster sugar. The egg whites should form peaks that are stiff but not dry. Add almond essence and whisk on high for an additional 30 seconds. Remove from mixer and using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped almonds and cornflour. Fill a piping bag (with no nozzle) with the meringue. Pipe 30 - 1.5" mounds of meringue onto the paper-covered baking sheets (~15 per sheet). Make an indentation into the centre of each meringue by dipping your thumb in some icing sugar and then into the centre of each meringue. Place meringues in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes. Reduce temperature to 200F/100C/ Fas 1/4 and bake for an additional 2 hours. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 20 min before handling. While crisps are cooling, prepare ganache. heat 1" of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place the plain chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow to heat for 5-6 minutes. Remove from heat and stir until smooth.

      <li>Date: Sun, 03 Mar 1996 20:39:06 -0500 From: Walt Gray &lt;waltgray@mnsinc.com&gt; In a large skillet, melt margarine. Add onion, garlic, and mushrooms. Saute until tender but not browned. Add tarragon, stir until it is softened. Pour mixture into a bowl of food processor. Add remaining ingredients. Process until mixture is smooth. Add cheese if you prefer a more spreadable consistency. Spoon into a serving bowl. Top with garnish of your choice. Makes 1-1/2 cups. People who do not like ordinary pate seem to love this one. Vary the herbs and substitute the vegetables as you wish. Serve with water crackers, thick slices of crusty French bread, thin slices of whole wheat bread, or unsalted whole wheat crackers. May be frozen. VARIATIONS: ~ Substitute other vegetables for the mushrooms (maybe broccoli.) ~ Substitute 1/2 t fennel for the tarragon and 1 c whole pecans for the almonds ~ vary the flavor by using other seasonings such as basil, oregano, dillweed, curry powder, or nutmeg.

      <li>3 tablespoons Carob powder plus 2 teaspoons; (divided)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Instant coffee powder (regular. decaffeinated; or grain)</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Toasted coconut</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The ultimate taste treat! The rich, exotic coffee flavor of Kahlua blends with the crunch of toasted almonds and coconut to make an outrageously good, no-bake confection. Make double the recipe-they freeze well. Roast the almonds in a 3500F oven for 10 minutes. In food processor or blender, grind the almonds to the consistency of coarse crumbs. Add the 3 tablespoons of carob, the coffee, coconut, and egg yolk, and 2 tablespoons of the Kahlua. Blend until all ingredients are incorporated. Scoop up about 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture at a time and roll between palms into a ball the size of a marble. Skewer on a toothpick, then roll each marble first in the remaining Kahlua, then in the remaining carob powder, and finally the toasted coconut. If you have any left after the usual raid by the kitchen kibitzers, refrigerate or freeze them until company comes. Yield: 24 truffles.

      <li>2 cups Milk</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Heavy cream</li>
      <li>3 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Superfine sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Kirsch</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pound the almond into paste. Add milk and heavy cream, mix thoroughly together. In a saucepan, heat the almond mixture to a boil. Remove from heat. In a bowl, mix egg yolks, sugar and kirsch for 5 minutes. Add almond milk and mix well with wooden spoon. Heat the mixture over low heat for 5 minutes without letting it boil. Stir continuously. Then allow it to cool. Strain through a sieve into ice cream maker and freeze until the ice cream is thoroughly firm. I think you can probably use instant almond paste or almond extract instead of pounding almond. Be careful that the paste or extract is sweetened or not. Also, you can add chopped fruits or nuts into the mixture. Just use your imagination and creativity.

    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/4 cups Butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sifted powdered sugar</li>
      <li>3 Unbeaten egg whites</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Ground almonds</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sifted all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cream together butter and powdered sugar; beat well. Add by degrees egg whites, almonds, flour and vanilla. This version can also be used to make Chinese fortune cookies. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS: You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner surface (gas or electric). Always use moderate heat. For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing, nothing more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as it is quite variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do NOT add at once all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the batter for consistency by baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is geared to use 1 tablespoon of batter for each wafer, and it should spread easily over the whole surface but should not run over when pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add more flour. Should any batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and cut off the excess batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron. Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely colored. As soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden spoon handle or cone form, and, when cool, fill it.

To soften the ice cream, place it in the refrigerator about thirty minutes before needed. And remember,not all of the ice cream is needed at the same time. If you need ice cream softened in a hurry, you can also microwave it on the defrost setting, checking it every thirty seconds at first, and then every fifteen seconds as it reaches the softened state.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds (about 1 3/4 cups) whole blanched almonds</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Water</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Light corn syrup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Almond extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here is a recipe for Almond Paste from the book "Secrets of A Jewish Baker" by George Greenstein. It is really a treasure trove of how to's. This is one recipe I have yet to try. Grind the almonds and 2 tablespoons of the water in a food processor until the mixture has a smooth texture when rubbed between your fingers. Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of water in a heavy saucepan. Add the sugar and corn syrup. Heat the mixture slowly until the sugar melts, then bring it to a boil. Cover and boil for 3 minutes. Remove the lid but do not stir the mixture. Heat the mixture to 240 degrees F (soft ball stage). (You may find it helpful to use a candy thermometer) Remove the pan from the heat and add the almond extract. With the food processor running, slowly add the hot syrup to the almonds until the paste forms a ball. When almond paste is cool, place in a sealable plastic bag or tightly covered container and refrigerate. Allow to season for one week. Bring to room temperature before using.

      <li>1 cup COLD water</li>

      <li>Referred to by family members as just Messapine. It is a traditional treat at Christmas. Mother mixes up the pastry and dough and invites one of the daughters to help her roll it out the following day. The notable differences in our recipes are the addition of baking powder and the way it is rolled out. Some of the younger family members use your method but there is a significant loss to the traditional flakiness of the pastry. Well worth the effort and a fun evening for mother and daughter. Pastry Dough: Sift together the flour and baking powder. Cut in the butter till it is fine as meal. Add the COLD water and mix into a smooth dough. Cover and refrigerate. Filling: Blend the almond paste and sugar in a blender or food processor. Add the eggs to the almond sugar mixture and mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate. REFRIGERATE both the pastry and filling overnight. To prepare for baking: Remove filling from fridge and allow to warm to room temperature. Keep dough refrigerated. Divide the dough into 8 parts. Shape each part into a ball and roll into a very large rectangle. The pastry should be almost paper thin. Carefully spread the filling evenly over the pastry: Divide the filling into 8 portions. The filling is sticky and the fragile pastry tears easily. Use small dollops of filling and spread with a spatula. Roll up like a jelly roll. Starting from a long side. Place on large baking sheets. Brush with egg slightly beaten egg white and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 425 degrees F. for 25 minutes.

      <li>* finely ground These cookies require precision timing and fast action but the results are worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and special occasions, but they are delicious anytime. Preheat oven to 350ø. Butter and flour baking sheet. In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto baking sheet (do not bake more than six at one time). Bake at 350ø for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown and still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so until the edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then, working quickly, lift cookies and turn them top side down onto paper towels. Roll over the handle of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder shape and let cool until crisp. Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place back in the oven for a few moments. Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a long time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season. Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if you do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy effect. Or roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.

    <title>Almond Meringue Cake with Strawberry and Vanilla Ice Crm Pt1</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CLASSIC MERINGUE</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Plus 1/3 cup granulated white sugar</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Egg whites; about 4 large at room temp</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Finely chopped almonds</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil spray</li>
      <li>1 quart Strawberry ice cream; softened slightly</li>
      <li>1 quart Vanilla ice cream; softened slightly</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sliced almonds; toasted</li>
      <li>Fresh strawberries; optional, for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position-, heat oven to 225 degrees. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Fit large pastry bag with 1/2-inch plain decorating tip. 2. Sift 2 tablespoons granulated sugar with confectioners' sugar-,set aside. 3. Place egg whites in large bowl of electric mixer. Using whisk attachment, whip them on low speed just until frothy. Increase speed to medium, sprinkle in 2 tablespoons reserved granulated sugar, and continue whipping to soft peaks. Gradually add 1/3 cup reserved granulated sugar, continue whipping to stiff, glossy peaks. Stop mixer, rub some meringue between your fingers. If smooth, proceed to next step. If still grainy, continue beating until smooth. 4. Sprinkle sifted powdered-sugar mixture and chopped almonds over meringue, fold in with rubber spatula until just incorporated. Immediately scoop meringue into prepared pastry bag. 5. Use a compass to trace 8-inch and 6 1/2-inch circles on parchment paper. If a compass is unavailable, use household items like lids or ramekins as guides to trace around. Before forming meringue shapes, pipe out or spoon a small quantity(about 1 1/2 teaspoon) of meringue into each corner of parchment paper to keep it in place as you work. Lightly spray each circle with cooking spray to ensure easy removal of meringues. Beginning in center of traced circle, pipe meringue in a continuous, widening spiral until it reaches edge of the circle.Hold the pastry bag perpendicular to baking sheet, 1 1/2 to 2 inches from area you are piping. Apply continuous pressure as you pipe. Pipe a couple of 1/2-inch disks with any excess meringue. These extra meringues are used to test for doneness. 6. Bake meringues until one of the test samples releases easily from paper and snaps crisply after 5 minutes of cooling, 60 to 80 minutes. Once sample is crisp when tested, remove baking sheet from oven and place on cooling rack until meringue disks are room temperature, about 30 minutes. Carefully remove cooled meringues from paper. Place larger disk on 9-inch round piece of cardboard or removable tart-pan bottom. Place smaller disk on similar surface. Freeze both disks for 30 minutes. (Can also be stored in an airtight container up to 2 weeks-, upon removal,freeze the disks before adding topping.) 7. Spread 2 cups of strawberry ice cream over each frozen disk with a flexible metal spatula. Return disk to freezer for 30 minutes or until ice cream is firm. 8. Spread 1 cup of vanilla ice cream over strawberry ice cream on large disk. Return disk to freezer until ice cream is firm. 9. When ice cream on large disks is frozen, carefully slide smaller meringue disk, ice-cream side up, on top of ice-cream layers on large disk. Spread the remaining vanilla ice cream over top and sides of cake. Move spatula from bottom upward to contour top and create dome shape. Return dessert to freezer until ice cream is firm. 10. Hold cake in one hand directly over a baking pan containing nuts. Use other hand to gently press nuts into ice cream. Nuts can be secured by pressing them gently into ice cream with a flexible metal spatula. 11. Return cake to freezer for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. About 15 continued in part 2</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>NOTE Regarding Pet evaporated milk: PET is a brand of evaporated milk. I use other brands with equal success in this cake. For those of you who do not have access to the chocolate pudding cake mixes, any moist chocolate cake baked from scratch will work equally well. CAKE--Prepare cake mix as directed and bake. FILLING--Heat 1 cup milk, sugar, and marshmallows until melted; add coconut. While cake is hot, cover completely with filling. Let set while preparing frosting. FROSTING--In saucepan heat 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup milk and margarine until it starts to boil; add chocolate chips. Stir until melted; add nuts, if desired. Pour over cake. &gt;From Carole: This is a tried and true cake and very rich. I bake the cake in a 9X13 sheet cake pan. Make sure the pan is deep enough to hold all three layers. After frosting the cake, I place almonds over the cake, insuring that when cut, each serving includes an almond. You can use either slivered or whole. It really does taste like an almond joy!

    <quantity>48</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 ounces Semisweet chocolate</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups All-purpose flour; spooned into measuring cup and leveled with the back of a knife</li>
      <li>2/3 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons Double acting baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Canned almond paste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Chilled unsalted butter; cut into l/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs plus</li>
      <li>1 large Egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup Lightly roasted whole almonds (see Note)</li>
      <li>1 cup Shelled pistachio nuts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>YIELD: About 48 biscotti DIFFICULTY: * PREPARATION: 30 minutes plus baking and cooling times Recipe From: Chocolatier Magazine Note: To lightly roast almonds, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, shaking the pan 2 or 3 times during roasting, until the nuts are beginning to color. Transfer the nuts to another baking sheet to stop the cooking process and cool completely. Using a large, sharp knife, cut the nuts into halves. 1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter and flour an "insulated" cookie sheet. 2. Using a large, sharp knife, finely chop the chocolate. (Do not use a food processor, it will chop the chocolate too fine.) Scrape the chocolate into a small bowl or cup. 3. In a food processor, using the metal chopping blade, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Process in on/off pulses until blended. Add the almond paste and butter. Process in on/off pulses until the mixture forms coarse crumbs. 4. Scrape the flour mixture into a large bowl. Using a rubber spatula stir in the almonds, pistachio nuts and chocolate. 5. Break the whole eggs into a measuring cup with a pouring spout. Add the egg yolk and beat with a fork, until blended. Remove 2 teaspoons of the egg mixture and set aside in a small cup to use later as egg wash. Add the vanilla to the egg mixture in the measuring cup and stir until blended. 6. Make a well in the center of the flour/nut mixture. Add the beaten egg/vanilla mixture and using a rubber spatula, stir until the mixture starts to clump together. Using your hands, form the mixture into a ball. 7. Scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and with your hands pat the ball into an 8-inch disk. Cut the disk into 4 equal wedges. 8. With lightly floured hands, gently roll each quarter into a 12-inch log. Carefully place the logs on the prepared cookie sheet at least 2 inches apart. Flatten slightly with the heel of your hand to the width of 1 1/4 inches. Lightly brush the logs with the reserved egg wash. 9. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the logs start to brown and bounce back when gently pressed with a finger. Set the cookie sheet on a wire rack and cool the logs for 20 minutes. 10. Position one rack in the top third and another rack in the bottom third; reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. 11. With a long metal cake spatula, carefully transfer the logs to a cutting surface. Using a sharp, finely serrated knife, cut the logs on the diagonal into 1/2-inch thick slices. Place the biscotti standing up, 1/2 inch apart on two ungreased "insulated" cookie sheets. 12. Bake an additional 15 to 25 minutes, until the biscotti are dry and the sides begin to color slightly. Halfway through baking, switch the positions of the cookie sheets for even browning. Do not overbake. 13. Cool the biscotti on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and cool completely. Store the biscotti in an airtight tin in a cool, dry place for up to two weeks.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's a recipe for Almond Joy Cake that I made to take to our church potluck dinner tomorrow. I got the recipe from one of the recipe lists awhile back. It was submitted by a person named Penchard. It looks and smells so good that I may not be able to keep my husband out of it until tomorrow. Bake cake as directed on package. Combine in large saucepan 1 cup evaporated milk and 1 cup sugar, bring to boil and stir in marshmallows until melted. Add coconut, and pour over cake while both are hot. Melt together the remaining milk, butter and chocolate chips. Stir until melted, and add the almond slices. Pour on top of warm cake. NOTE: I baked mine in a 9x13 pan. I also poked some holes in the top of the baked cake before pouring the coconut mixture over all.

      <li>6 Egg whites, at room temp.</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Sugar, powdered, sifted, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Almonds, ground, blanched</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 F. Cut out three 10-inch parchment paper circles and one 10-inch cardboard circle. Set the parchment circles on baking sheets. Beat egg whites to soft peaks and gradually add 2 1/2 tablespoons of sugar and continue beating until stiff. Combine 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and ground almonds; fold into egg whites. This mixture can now be used to form layers, or designs or whatever your choose. Simply spoon mixture into a pastry bag fitted with the tip of your choice, and pipe your designs onto parchment paper covered baking sheets. Dust lightly with powdered sugar (optional.) Then bake the your meringue until crisp and very lightly golden (for designs about a half inch thick, it takes 25 to 30 minutes.) Cool on the finished baked meringue on racks.

      <li>1. Toast the almonds and set aside. 2. Combine all other ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Chill for at least 1 hour. 3. Form the cream cheese mixture into the shape of a pinecone. Beginning at the bottom,, gently press the almonds in rows across the pinecone shape. Continue the rows until the whole shape is covered, and resembles a pinecone. Either eat immediately or refrigerate. Allow to come up to room temperature before serving. Garnish with greens. NOTES : A marble board works well for this as it will hold the cool temperature longer than a plate. If fresh greens are used be careful that they are not poisonous.

      <li>From: Bobb1744@aol.com Date: Sun, 21 Apr 1996 22:13:52 -0400 Recipe By: Red Fla Coarsely chop the almonds by hand or in a food processor ( a blender will chop them too fine). This should yield 1 1/3-1 1/2 cups chopped nuts. Combine the nuts, vodka, and vnilla bean in a 1 quart Mason jar. Seal the jar, shake to mix, and set it aside in a cool, dark place for at least 10 days. Strain the liquor through a fine sieve into a 4 cup glass measuring cup and discard the residue in the sieve. Rinse the sieve and the Mason jar thoroughly. Fit the sieve with a damp coffe filter and strain the flavored vodka back into the jar. Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Continue to boil for 2 minutes, until a clear syrup forms. Remove the pan from the heat and cool to room temp. When the syrup is cool , add it to the Mason jar. Add the vanilla and glycerin. Seal the jar and shake it gently to blend. The liqueur can be transferred to a decanter. The almond Liqueur should be ready to drink in 2-3 days and has a shelf life of 2-3 weeks. NOTES : Yield-2 cup.

Form cookies by dropping teaspoons of mixture on well greased baking sheet, 1" apart. Top each with a whole almond. Bake on middle sheet of oven for 10-12 minutes, watching cookies carefully after 8-9 minutes,as the bottom can get too brown. Immediately remove cookies from pan with metal spatula and cool on wax peper covered rack. These taste a bit like the chocolate bars; hence the name.

      <li>Date: Thu, 18 Apr 1996 09:26:17 -0500 From: dbailey@ssi.parlorcity.com (David Bailey) Melt chocolate chips over hot water (a double boiler works great or you can do it in the microwave); then let the chocolate cool for 10 minutes. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry then beat in the sugar gradually. Beat until stiff and satiny. Fold the vanilla, chocolate, and almonds into the egg whites. Drop by spoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 minutes. This will make 4 1/2 dozen - gauge the size of the meringue accordingly so you know you are making them the correct size.

      <li>(*) To blanch almonds, dip almonds into boiling water for 1 minute. Remove the brown skin covering. Dry in a 200°F oven for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use a food processor to chop them to the finest size possible. (A 2-pound bag of almonds is what you'll need for this recipe). Preheat oven to 300°F. Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes). NOTES : This recipe is a double recipe. These are one of my favorite cookies--I just LOVE almonds!

    <quantity>20</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 1/2 Yards large sausage casing; about 2-3 inches wide</li>
      <li>4 pounds Lean fresh pork</li>
      <li>2 pounds Pork fat</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground bay leaf</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>di2@delphi.com (Diana Rattray) Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots of garlic. Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and greilled, it makes a delightful appetizer. It is also used in a superb oyster and andouille gumbo poplular in Laplace, a Cajun town about 30 miles from New Orleans that calls itself the Andouille Capital of the World. Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to loosen the salt in which it is packed. Cut into 3 yard lengths, then place the narrow end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing. Place the wide end of the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the inside of the casing to remove any salt. (Roll up the casing you do not intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse salt in a large jar, place the rolled up casing on it, then fill the rest of the jar with salt. Close tightly and refrigerate for later use.) Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once through the coarse blade of the meat grinder. Combine the pork with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cut the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie a knot in each piece of casing about 2 inches from one end. Fit the open end over the tip of the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1 inch from the wide end. Push the rest of the casing onto the stuffer until the top touches the knot. (The casing will look like accordian folds on the stuffer.) Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder as directed on the instructions that come with the machine, or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opeoning by hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if it is electric and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a manual machine, push the stuffing through with a wooden pestle. The sausage casing will fill and inflate gradually. Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out any bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out of the casing. Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make a knot in the casing itself. Repeat until all the stuffing is used up. To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot skillet with no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp at the edges.

    <ingredient>
      <li>5 cups Beans, canned (drained)</li>
      <li>6 cups Tomatoes, stewed</li>
      <li>2 pounds Beef, cut into bite-sized pieces and browned (don't use ground beef)</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves, chopped</li>
      <li>3 medium Jalapeno peppers, cut up</li>
      <li>2 Green bell peppers, diced</li>
      <li>2 medium Onions, diced (or less)</li>
      <li>Beer, flavorful (1 bottle)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cumin</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cayenne pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Saute the meat and onions. You may do it in the same pan that you are going to put the chili in. The meat should be brown on the outside, but you don't have to cook it much at this time. Drain the fat from the beef. Put everything in a big pot over low heat (a slow cooker is handy) and stir together. Wait half an hour to an hour and check the flavor of the soupy base. Adjust as you see fit. Perhaps add more beer, hot peppers, or spices. Repeat as necessary. Wait as long as you can, stirring occasionally. You may eat it when the beans and beef are soft. Serve with bread, fresh-baked biscuits or cornbread. This is best if it has cooked at least overnight. Generally it's ready for consumption after about three hours. If you can't turn your stove down to a very low heat, you're bound to burn the bottom of the chili a little, but as long as you don't scrape it off, it will taste okay. Slow-cookers are great in this regard! At the three hour mark, the chili is somewhat soupy. If you want it to thicken up, turn up the heat a bit and let it boil off the excess water. While doing this, stir every few minutes or you may burn the bottom! NOTES: * Andy's own recipe for meat/bean chili -- This is the descendant of the chili that I've been making since 1974. * I change the proportions of ingredients (double the beef, drop the beans, add LOTS more cumin) all the time; this recipe is just a general guideline. The amount of garlic given in the recipe is very conservative. Garbanzo beans (chick peas) are nice, but they take a lot longer to cook. Making it with lamb or Italian sausage instead of beef is also interesting. Cherry peppers instead of jalapeno peppers are very nice also. * Do not use wimpy American beer! I have found that Moosehead adds a good flavor, and I bet that Anchor Steam will too. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 15 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking. : Precision: no need to measure. : Andrew Scott Beals : Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore Ca : bandy@lll-crg.arpa, {ihnp4,pyramid,seismo,topaz,ll-xn}!lll-crg!bandy : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Roast mix -- any roasts</li>
      <li>10 pounds Massa 3/4 can</li>

      <li>1 large Jar</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Lard -- (the big can)</li>
      <li>Chili powder</li>
      <li>Garlic powder</li>
      <li>Cumin</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Boil the meat with garlic powder until mushy. Drain broth and flake mushy meat. Season with all the cumin and salt. Add 1/2 cup of the broth back to make the consistancy more mushy. (you can do this step the day before) Mix the lard, salt and chili powder to the Massa. Add in enough of the broth to make the Massa spreadable. Take one package of corn husks which have been soaked for 30 minutes in water and separate. To make the tamales, spread some Massa mixture (about 1 or 2 tablespoons) over the corn husk, about 1/4 inch thick, starting about 2 inches from the bottom of the husk. This part will have no Massa and will be folded over the tamale to seal it. Put about 1 tablespoon of filling into the tamale, roll, fold over the empty corn husk to seal. When you have made about 2 to 3 dozen, stand upright in a pan with either a steamer or wadded aluminum foil to keep the tamales straight, open end up. Put about 2 inches of water in the pan and pour more broth INTO the open ends of the tamales to soak. Cover and steam for 45 minutes to an hour. (Increase or decrease steam time depending on how many tamales are in the pan) The great part of this recipe is tasting the batch you just made to see if it is tasty. Increase the heat by adding a diced jalapeno or serano pepper. The chili powder adds enough heat to spice them, but children can still eat them. The peppers are for the die-hard dragons in the group. Also, if you don't get the Massa salty enough you should adjust that. Vary each batch, label, wrap 6 to a package with freezer paper and enjoy!

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Andouille - finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Tasso - finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 Pan cornbread about 9-inch pan</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Margarine</li>
      <li>1 cup Onions - finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Green onions - finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Celery - finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Mushrooms - fresh, sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Parsley - finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Bell pepper - finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Garlic - finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Start off by baking your cornbread to package directions (be sure you choose an unsweetened cornbread mix) and letting it cool to room temperature. Then, to a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil, toss in the finely chopped andouille and tasso, reduce the heat, and simmer for about 1 hour until the meats are soft and tender. Meanwhile, take a 12-inch skillet and melt the margarine over medium heat. Then quickly saute the onions, green onions, celery, mushrooms, bell pepper, parsley and garlic until all of them are just wilted ~- DO NOT OVERCOOK! Next, take a mixing bowl and crumble the cornbread. Then stir in the sauteed vegetable mixture and all of the meats and blend everything thoroughly. At this point, begin adding the meat stock you made - a little at a time -- to moisten the dressing. Remember... you want the stuffing "just moist" -- not wet! And you want to taste the stuffing before adding any salt and pepper. There may already be enough in the tasso and andouille to suit you. Use with Stuffed Veal Pocket. NOTE: The best way to enhance the flavor of a traditional New Orleans veal pocket is to stuff it with a cornbread dressing spiced up with andouille and tasso.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots of garlic. Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and greilled, it makes a delightful appetizer. It is also used in a superb oyster and andouille gumbo poplular in Laplace, a Cajun town about 30 miles from New Orleans that calls itself the Andouille Capital of the World. Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to loosen the salt in which it is packed. Cut into 3 yard lengths, then place the narrow end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing. Place the wide end of the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the inside of the casing to remove any salt. (Roll up the casing you do not intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse salt in a large jar, place the rolled up casing on it, then fill the rest of the jar with salt. Close tightly and refrigerate for later use.) Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once through the coarse blade of the meat grinder. Combine the pork with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cut the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie a knot in each piece of casing about 2 inches from one end. Fit the open end over the tip of the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1 inch from the wide end. Push the rest of the casing onto the stuffer until the top touches the knot. (The casing will look like accordian folds on the stuffer.) Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder as directed on the instructions that come with the machine, or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opeoning by hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if it is electric and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a manual machine, push the stuffing through with a wooden pestle. The sausage casing will fill and inflate gradually. Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out any bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out of the casing. Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make a knot in the casing itself. Repeat until all the stuffing is used up. To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot skillet with no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp at the edges.

      <li>Warm buttermilk and add shortening, stirring to melt, and cool. Add the yeast which has been softenend in 1/4 cup warm water. Add sugar. Sift together and add flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir to mix and cover with a damp cloth and an inverted plate. Chill overnight. At this point, the dough will keep about 5 dayse to be used as needed. The 6th &amp; 7th days, use the dough as cobbler topping or for fried pies. When ready t use dough, roll out 1/4" thick, cut in 1 1/2" rounds, brush each round with melted butter and stack two together. Place in greased pan, almost touching. Let rise 1 hour, then bake at 400° for 10 minutes or until done, depending on size of biscuits. A good use for Angel Biscuit Dough on the 6th &amp; 7th days is Fried Apple Pies.

    <ingredient>
      <li>5 pounds Pork butt</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Pork fat</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Cracked black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dried thyme</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Salt</li>
      <li>6 Feet beef middle casing</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cube pork butt into one and a half inch cubes. Using a meat grinder with four one quarter inch holes in the grinding plate, grind pork and pork fat. If you do not have a grinding plate this size, I suggest hand cutting pork butt into one quarter inch square pieces. Place ground pork in large mixing bowl and blend in all remaining ingredients. Once well blended, stuff meat into casings in one foot links, using the sausage attachement on your meat grinder. Tie both ends of the sausage securely using a heavy gauge twine. In your homestyle smoker, smoke andouille at 175-200 degrees F for approximately four to five hours using pecan or hickory wood. The andouille may then be frozen and used for seasoning gumbos, white or red beans, pastas or grilling as an hors d'oeuvre.

    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>6 large Eggs</li>
      <li>1 pound Ricotta Cheese</li>
      <li>1 pound Cream Cheese</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Separate eggs and beat whites stiff. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix all ingredients except the egg whites. Fold in the egg whites until just completely mixed. Butter and lightly flour a 9" spring pan. Pour in the entire mixture. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 1 hour - do not open oven door. Without opening oven door, turn off oven and let remain in oven for an additional hour. Remove from oven; the cheesecake should be lightly browned and should have several cracks in the center. The center will also be slightly lower than the edges. If you do choose to use a glaze, you will see that this cheesecake forms its own rim. If your oven runs hot or cold, change the temperature by + or - 25 degrees rather than changing the cooking and idle time. Insert knife around sides of pan to insure easy removal of spring pan sides. Remove the spring pan sides and place cheesecake and bottom of spring pan on a plate to catch the liquid which will exude during the 3 hours the cheesecake is in the refrigerator. The longer the better in this case. Do not cover. This recipe takes about 5 1/2 hours from start to eating. (Much of it free time for other tasks). But it is definitely worth the effort. Enjoy!

Add the juice from the tomatoes. Using your hands or a fork, break up the whole tomatoes and add to the pot. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. 2. Stir in the basil, parsley, wine and pepper flakes, season with salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 1 hour. 3. Remove the sauce from the heat. Whisk in the butter until melted.

    <ingredient>
      <li>2 ounces Home-candied angelica</li>
      <li>1 Shortcrust pastry *</li>
      <li>1 1/2 ounces Butter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Curd cheese</li>
      <li>1 Egg yolk; mixed with:</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Milk</li>
      <li>1 Egg white</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note: Shortcrust pastry made with 7-8 oz flour will be about right for this recipe. These tarts are irresistible when made with home-candied angelica, as dull as ditchwater when store-bought is used. Chop the angelica into small pieces, cover with warm water to rinse off some of the sugar and set aside for a few minutes. While the angelica soaks, line 18 x 2 1/2 inch tartlet tins with the shortcrust pastry and start preparing the filling. Dice and barely melt the butter in a small saucepan. Away from the heat, beat in the honey, then the curd cheese, then the egg yolk mixed with the milk. Stir in the well drained angelica. Whisk the egg white to snowy peaks and fold it in. Spoon the mixture into the pastry-lined tartlet tins and bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes until puffed up and golden. Serve as soon as cooled from cooking.

      <li>Or romano che</li>
      <li>Cappelini (angelhair pasta)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a skillet, sautee the garlic, onion and frying peppers in the olive oil until onion is transluscent (about 2 min). Add the Broccoli and let it cook until bright green. 2. Add the rest of the peppers and the brussel sprouts/cabbage, the tomatoes, basil and salt and pepper. Toss very well so the tomatoes have a chance to cook. Add the grouper andcover for about 5 min. 3. The liquid from the fish mixes with the tomatos for a kind of sauce. Add the parsley and cover until the fish is cooked all the way through. 4. Take off heat and mix with the cheese. Some people may like more than 1/2 cup of cheese so keep it handy. 5. Serve over Cappelini. Author's Notes: Here is a kind of throw together recipe I came up with: If you are entertaining you can garnish with fresh parsley and serve with a caesar salad, garlic bread and a nice chablis. The vegetables can vary. I've used mushrooms, spinach, cauliflower etc. Grouper works well with this because it has a lot of flavor. I've used fresh tuna and halibut but prefer grouper. Difficulty : easy. Precision : measure ingredients. Recipe By : Doris Woods dfw@needle..bellcore.com From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Andouille sausage cut into bite size pieces</li>
      <li>1 small Red onion diced</li>
      <li>1 small Green bell pepper diced</li>
      <li>2 Ribs of celery diced</li>
      <li>2 Cloves of garlic diced fine</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Red chile flakes</li>
      <li>6 Stalks of kale cut into 1" strips</li>
      <li>2 quarts Turkey stock (or chicken)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I made this soup at work tonight and thought I'd share the recipe since it really is outstanding. It's adapted from a recipe I saw that used Chorizzo. What really struck me was that the kale was really good in this soup. At my restaurant we make a strong turkey stock for a means to heat our turkey for hot sandwiches and turkey dinners. This is what I used but a good chicken stock will work just as well. Heat the oil in a 1 quart sauce pan over medium high heat. Just as the oil starts to smoke throw in the onion, bell pepper, celery and stir the pan. This will cool the oil but it will quickly re-heat. Keep stiring for 2 min. then add the Andouille sausage and cook till the sausage starts to brown around the edges and give up some of it's fat to the pan. Add the garlic and chile flakes and cook for 2 min. more stiring constantly. Add the kale and stir till coated by everything in the pan. Add the turkey stock and bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for 20 min. Check seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots fo garlic. Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and greilled, it makes a delightful appetizer. It is also used in a superb oyster and andouille gumbo poplular in Laplace, a Cajun town about 30 miles from New Orleans that calls itself the Andouille Capital of the World. (about 6 pounds of 20 inch sausage, 3 to 3 1/2 inches thick) Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to loosen the salt in which it is packed. Cut into 3 yard lengths, then place the narrow end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing. Place the wide end of the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the inside of the casing to remove any salt. (Roll up the casing you do not intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse salt in a large jar, place the rolled up casing on it, then fill the rest of the jar with salt. Close tightly and refrigerate for later use.) Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once through the coarse blade of the meat grinder. Combine the pork with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cut the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie a knot in each piece of casing about 2 inches from one end. Fit the open end over the tip of the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1 inch from the wide end. Push the rest of the casing onto the stuffer until the top touches the knot. (The casing will look like accordian folds on the stuffer.) Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder as directed on the instructions that come with the machine, or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opeoning by hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if it is electric and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a manual machine, push the stuffing through with a wooden pestle. The sausage casing will fill and inflate gradually. Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out any bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out of the casing. Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make a knot in the casing itself. Repeat until all the stuffing is used up. To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot skillet with no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp at the edges.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>While looking through the December issue of "Louisiana Country," the publication for the rural electric cooperatives in that state, I noticed these oyster recipes that sound worth trying, particularly the Angels on Horseback (if you like spicy stuff, see my note after recipe). Thaw oysters if frozen. Drain oysters. Sprinkle with parsley and seasonings. Place one oyster on each piece of bacon. Wrap bacon around oysters; secure with toothpick. Place on broiler pan. Broil about 4 inches from heat source 8 to 10 min. or until bacon is crisp. Turn carefully. Broil 4 to 5 min. longer or until bacon is crisp. Makes about 30. MY NOTE: This sounds similar to something a friend makes called Oysters Diablo. He wraps the bacon around the oyster (sometimes he uses shrimp for (duh) Shrimp Diablo!) and a strip of jalapeno and bastes during the broiling process with Worcestershire.

    <title>Andrea's White Chocolate Mousse</title>
    <category>Pudding</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound White chocolate</li>
      <li>1 cup Whipping cream</li>
      <li>3 Eggs; separated</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Brandy</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Hot water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vanilla</li>
      <li>2 ounces Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over medium-low heat. It's a good idea to stand over the chocolate while it's melting and stir until it has melted completely; take it off the heat immediately. Whip the cream and set aside. Pour the brandy and hot water slowly into a bowl with the egg yolks, whisking briskly as you go until completely mixed. Whisk in the melted chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is completely combined; this will help cool the chocolate. Whip the egg whites and the sugar, adding the vanilla as you beat, until peaking but not dry. Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture carefully with a wooden spoon. Fold in the whipped cream. This is the most critical part of the recipe. The key to a great chocolate mousse is incorporating cooled chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate must be cool to the touch or the cream will separate. Lightly blend the two mixtures until uniform. The mousse is actually at its best texture as soon as mixed.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 teaspoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 ounces Bulk andouille; finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Finely chopped onions</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped parsley</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cream cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>16 large Fresh jalapenos</li>
      <li>Essence</li>
      <li>3 cups Flour</li>
      <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Beer; (up to 1)</li>
      <li>1 pinch Baking powder</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat the fryer. In a saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat and render the andouille for 2 minutes. Add the onions and saute for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and cool. In a mixing bowl, mix the garlic, parsley, and cream cheese together. Mix well. Stir in the cooled andouille mixture. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper. Using a sharp knife, split the jalapenos, starting at the tip, in half, leaving the stem intact. Remove the seeds from the pepper. Stuff 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling in the center of each pepper. Press the pepper together, sealing the cheese mixture completely inside. Season 1 cup of flour with Essence. In a mixing bowl, whisk the yolks and 3/4 cup of the beer. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Whisk in enough flour to form a batter. If the batter is too thick add the remaining beer to thin the batter. Dredge the stuffed peppers in the seasoned flour. Dip the jalapenos in the batter, letting the excess drip off and coating the peppers completely. Gently lay the jalapenos in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the jalapenos from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the peppers with Essence.

Brown the ground beef and drain; add the taco seasoning and water according to the packet directions. While doing this, have someone else chop the veggies and shred the cheese. If using the taco salad bowls, bake them in the oven. If using taco chips, smash them up. While working, pour margaritas and beers and take sips every now and then. Supply bowls to place all the ingredients in separately. When everything is done and ready to go, sit down at table. Make sure everyone has a beer or margarita!! Pass everything around and let everyone make their own mess (salad). One last important thing - the GUYS get clean up duty!!!

      <li>1/2 cups Shortening</li>
      <li>1 cup Buttermilk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I have been gifted Granny Byrds recipe file so I am posting one of my favorites. This was on a very old yellowed newspaper clipping and appears to have come from a Heloise column. Angel Bisquits the name and delious eatings the game. They are so simple to make, yet the most irrestible morsels to pass your palate. You can mix these bisquits up one day and bake them the next. Why the dough will even keep up to three days in the refrigerator in a covered bowl. Dissolve the yeast in warm water,setting aside.Mix the dry ingrediants in the order given. Cut the shortening in as you would usually do for pie dough or bisquits. Stir in the buttermilk and yeast mixture. Blend thoroughly and the dough is ready to refrigerate or roll into bisquits. When you are ready to make bisquits turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead lightly as for regular bisquits. Roll out and cut as you would for regular bisquits, placing in a greased pan. Set aside and let the dough rise slightly before baking in a 400 degrees oven for 12 or 15 minutes untuil lightly browned and done. If the dough is cold you will need to let it sit a little longer to rise. I can remember my grandmother going to my great-grandmothers and making a bowl to put in her refrigerator when Big Moma got too weak to stand and cook alot. Big Moma would pinch off a little for her meal and cook what she wanted. Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #184 by Sue Johnson &lt;suebuggy@icu2.net&gt; on Aug 07, 1997</li>

Drain the fat. Chop the tomatoes into bite-size pieces (do not drain) and add to the beef. Add the mushrooms, celery, pepper and garlic. Add herbs, crushing first, making sure the rosemary needles are well broken-up. Add a dollop (just enough for flavor) of olive oil, grind some pepper on top to taste. Finally, add the hot sauce to taste, remembering that the sauce simmers down and it will concentrate the hot stuff! Cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes uncovered, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Uncover, and reduce sauce until it is the desired consistency. Serve over pasta with grated cheese and crusty bread. Heather Pierce Walt MM Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #250 Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 21:20:14 -0400 From: Walt Gray &lt;waltgray@mnsinc.com&gt;</li>

      <li>4 cups Basmati; (or long grain rice)</li>
      <li>3 pounds Mutton; 1.5" cubes</li>
      <li>2 cups Yogurt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cubic centimters Ginger</li>
      <li>10 large Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 Cinnomon stick; 1"</li>
      <li>14 Cloves</li>
      <li>10 Cardomon seeds</li>
      <li>10 small Onions; sliced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Ghee</li>
      <li>6 cups Water; boiling</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Turmeric</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash and soak the rice in water for 1/2 hour. Drain off the water and tie the rice into a cloth. Add the meat to a mixture of the yogurt and 2 tsp salt and set aside. Saute the chiles in 1 TBS ghee. Mix the chiles, ginger, garlic, and half the cinnamon, cloves and cardamom together and grind into a fine paste. Rub the ground spices into the meat. Heat half the remaining ghee and add the meat and spice/yogurt mixture and half the onions and cook over a low fire until the meat is tender. Heat the remaining ghee and add the remaining cinnamon, cloves and cardamom. After they have cooked for a few minutes add the rest of the onions and fry until they are golden brown. Add the rice and fry it until it is slightly brown. At this point, add the 6 cups boiling water, and then the turmeric and remaining salt. Let the rice mixture cook until the water is almost level with the grains (the rice should be half done by then) and then add the meat and its gravy. Do not mix them, but, after placing a tight lid on the pot, let the biriyani simmer for 15-20 minutes. After this, mix well and serve. Serves 8. This is almost a complete meal by itself, although pickles, chutneys and vegetables dishes would probably be served with it. Heat scale: Hot.

      <li>Here is a recipe, developed young man here in the Detroit area. With this recipe, he won a $10,000 scholarship to Johnson and Wales College, which is considered a top-notch cooking school, located in Charleston, SC. This young man, Andre Black, spent 2 weeks developing this recip, this cake was among the top 19 recipes chosen &lt;out of 270&gt; as winners. Andre was on the front page of the Detroit News yesterday, along with the recipe. The Detroit News food writer, Robin Mather says "For a Carrot Cake, this is a hell of a fruit cake. She found this cake suited to 3 8" layers. Preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour three 8" layer pans. Combine eggs, sugar and oil. Beat on high speed until creamy and thick, 3-5 minutes. Sift together flour, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Slowly add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to egg mixture; beat well. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients, beating well after each addition. Batter will be extrememly stiff; it may be necessary to blend with a spatula or spoon. One by one, fold in carrots, coconut, pineapple, walnuts and raisins. Divide batter between the 3 prepared cake pans. Bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes, arranging cake pans in oven once. The cake is done when the tester inserted in center comes out clean. Let cake cool in pans 5 minutes. Turn out onto rack to cool completely. When cakes are cool, prepare frosting: combine margarine, cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Frost cake. * Andre's original recipe, written in professional baking terms, calls for 6 oz beaten eggs, 15 1/2 oz of sugar, and 12 oz cake flour Andre hopes tobbecome an executive chef, and own his own resturant someday.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CANDIED ANGELICA STEMS</li>
      <li>Broad green angelica stems</li>
      <li>Water enough to cover the stems</li>
      <li>Sugar; same volume as water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>"Angelica has a variety of culinary uses. Its unique flavor is difficult to describe except by listing its components: musky, bitter, celerylike, aniselike, slightly sweet, fresh. The hollow stems are jellied or candied (see recipe below) and either eaten alone or used to decorate desserts. About 1/4 cup fresh angelica stems, cut in short pieces, can be added to rhubarb to counteract its tartness and reduce the necessary sugar by as much as one-third. The stems and dried roots are sometimes boiled like celery and can be cooked with sugar like rhubarb. The slightly bitter leaves may be served with fish, and sometimes are candied with the stems. "Consuming large amounts of angelica can cause photosensitivity in some individuals, and pregnant women should avoid using any part of the plant. Commercially, the seeds and see oil flavor liqueurs and desserts, and scent cosmetics. The pungent, juniper-flavored roots are used with or instead of juniper berries to flavor gin. Arkansas or Quapaw Indians mixed the root of A. atropurpurea with tobacco for smoking. The robust angelica stalks are handsome in dried arrangements, and the coumarin-containing leaves sometimes serve as a potpourri fixative." CANDIED ANGELICA STEMS ====================== The best stems for candying are the new growth in the second year. Cut them into manageable pieces, then blanch 1-2 minutes. Peel the blanched stems, them cut them into pieces 2 inches long by 1/2 inch wide. Simmer 20 minutes in a syrup made of the sugar and water. Drain, reserving the syrup, and refrigerate stems and syrup, covered, for four days. Reheat the angelica in the syrup and cook for 20 minutes, or until candied. The temperature of the syrup should reach 238 F. Drain the angelica and dry on racks set over waxed paper. Store in airtight containers. [NOTE: For safety's sake, do not gather angelica in the wild. Wild angelica is easily confused with the deadly poisonous lookalike, water hemlock (Cicula maculata).] * Excerpted from: 'An Herb to Know' column by Sharon Hagemann * The Herb Companion - August/September 1993 * Typed for you by Karen Mintzias From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Date: Thu, 21 Mar 1996 22:39:47 -0500 From: AKACarl@aol.com (Clare Shipman) Hi! I have been experimenting with FF deviled eggs, which means you discard the yolk and replace it with something. Here is the result, We think it is pretty good. This recipe does not show quantities because it depends on the number of eggs. If you make too much filling, boil some more eggs! Peel eggs, cut in half and discard yolks. Mix potato flakes, mayonnaise, and mustard to desired consistency. Add chopped onions and a dash of Tobasco. Add other seasonings to taste, such as curry powder or chopped chives. A small amount of nutritional yeast will thicken mixture and contribute a cheese-like flavor. Let stand in refrigator about an hour. Fill centers of boiled-egg halves. Dust tops with paprika and garnish as desired. Chill and serve. FATFREE DIGEST V96 #80 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

      <li>submitted by: lloyd2@mindspring.com (Lloyd A. Carver, Prattville, AL 36067) Recipe By : Kathryn Gatens This is a recipe I picked up while in Panama. It is for Spareribs used as an appetizer but I have the same recipe with only the meat changed to pork chops. Then it is a dinner meat. It is good either way. I included the original recipe in Spanish and my interpretation in English. Have the rack of ribs cut in 3 parts lengthwise. Then divide each part into individual ribs. Arrange in a baking dish. Separately, mix the molasses with the prepared mustard; add the remaining ingredients and mix all well. Paint the ribs with the sauce. Bake at 350F, for 1 1/2 hour, basting frequently with the rest of the sauce. To Serve, drain well on absorbent paper. Arrange in a chafing dish to keep hot. NOTES : If desired, prepared the ribs or chops several days ahead of time and freeze. To serve, bake at 300F until hot. Approximately 1 hour. Haga cortar las costillas en 3 partes, a lo largo. Luego, divida cada parte in costillitas individuales. Coloquelas en un cecipiente de hornear. Aparte, lique la melaza con la mostaza preparada; aqada los ingredientes restantes y mizclelo todo bien. Pinte las costillas con salsa. Hornilas a 350F (180C) durante 1 1/2 hora, pintandolas frecuentemente con el resto de la salsa. Para servirlas, esczrralas antes, sobre papel absorbente. Colsquelas luego en una fuente de servir con brasero abajo, para conservarlas calientes. NOTES : Si quiere, puede hacer costillas o chuletas con varios dias de anticipacisn y congelaras. Para servirlas a 300F (150C) hasta que se calienten aproximadamente 1 hora.

Immediately remove muffins from pan; serve warm or cool on wire rack. Makes 12 muffins. About 155 calories each. NOTES : I always leave the apples unpeeled but peel if you wish. You may also bake this as a quickbread in which case, use a standard loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes at 350-375 degrees. Pans made from ceramic, glass, black, dark or polished metals exhibit different baking characteristics. Baking times and temperatures should be adjusted accordingly.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat the molds of a mini-Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray or oil. Sprinkle with white sugar, shaking out the excess. In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon; set aside. In another bowl, whisk together egg, brown sugar, apple butter, maple syrup, cider, yogurt and oil. Add the dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Divide half the batter among the prepared molds, spooning about 2 generous tablespoonfuls of batter into each mold. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the tops spring back when touched lightly. Loosen the edges and turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool. Clean the mini-Bundt pan, then recoat it with cooking spray or oil and sugar. Repeat with the remaining batter. To make maple glaze: In a bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Gradually whisk in enough maple syrup to make a coating consistency. Dip the fluted side of the "doughnuts" in the glaze to coat. Then set them glazed side up on a wire rack over waxed paper for a few minutes until the glaze has set.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>modified from the book _Cookwise_ by Shirly O. Corriher (a great book by the way). Just what we all need, yet another muffin recipe. I hesitated sending this because you all probably have tons of muffin recipes but I finally decided to send it because I think it's a real winner. Very popular with everyone who's tried it. This is a very moist and sweet muffin despite my reducing the sugar and dried fruit from the original recipe. You could experiment with reducing it even more it you're watching your weight. I always double the following recipe and it makes so much I have to mix it in my largest pot, its too big for my largest bowl. Doubled it makes 6 large muffins, 12 small muffins and 2 even larger muffins filling everything I own which makes muffins. They freeze very well. 1. Arrange shelf to just below centre of oven and pre-heat oven to 200c / 400f. 2. Combine first seven ingredients (oat bran, flour, milk powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking powder) in a large bowl. 3. Add the next four ingredients (carrot, apple, raisins, orange zest). 4. In a second bowl combine the liquid ingredients (egg replacer, milk, applesauce, vanilla and pinapple). 5. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir only enough to just combine. The batter is very wet. 6. Spray non-stick muffin tins with cooking spray. Spoon the mixture into the muffin tins to fill them about half way. 7. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes. (Makes about 12 small muffins) Posted to fatfree digest by cctlg@cc.newcastle.edu.au (Terri Nowak) on May 17, 1998</li>

      <li>1/4 cups (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2/3 cups (packed) golden brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
      <li>4 large Granny Smith apples (about 28 oz) peeled; quartered, cored, cut into 1/2"-thick wedges</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Minced crystalized ginger</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CAKE</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Minced crystallized ginger</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Plus 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (packed) golden brown sugar</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter at room temp</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Whole milk</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CREAM</li>
      <li>1 cup Chilled whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ground ginger</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(Bon Appetit, January 1998) For topping: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 F. Butter 9" diameter cake pan with 2" high sides. Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar and cook until mixture bubbles, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in ground ginger. Pour mixture into prepared pan, spreading with spatula to distribute evenly. Tightly overlap apples atop sugar mixture making 2 layers of apples. Sprinkle crystallized ginger atop apples. Set aside. For Cake: Mix crystallized ginger with 1 tbl flour in small bowl. Sift 1 1/4 cup plus 3 tbl flour, baking soda, and salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat brown sugar and butter until light and creamy. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Beat in vanilla. Mix in sifted dry ingredients alternately with milk. Stir in ginger mixture. Spoon butter atop apples in pan. Bake cake until brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan on rack 15 minutes. Whip cream, 2 tbl sugar, and ground ginger in another medium bowl to soft peaks. Run small knife around edges of pan to loosen cake. Place platter over cake and invert cake onto platter. Serve warm or at room tempereature with cream. I halved this recipe and it worked out very well. I'd imagine you can use peaches, pineapple, apricot, pears, etc. The softer fruits might need adjustments for dry ingredients. And, of course, it took 4 stores to find crystallized ginger in New York City! Posted to FOODWINE Digest by Jessica Chaiken &lt;jessc@IX.NETCOM.COM&gt; on Dec 29, 1997</li>

      <li>carefully remove asparagas spears from tin, spread on towel to drain for at least two hours ;(if some are very "fat" split in half. remove crusts from bread carefully spread each square with butter, and then spread carefully and generously with mayonaise. take a spear and put diagonal on bread - sprinkle generously with S &amp; P roll from corner to make a tube. I then cut the tube in half to make smaller portions - your choice pile in bowl or on plate, cover with aluminum foil (putting in Tupperware doesn't seem to have the same effect, who knows why) Refrigerate for several hours. Remove from frig at least 1/2 hour before serving. So - easy right - make it in the morning - and the 1/2 hour out of frig is while you're driving to the party ... every party I took these two they were the first thing gone, men, kids, everyone said, these are weird, humm but good!

Cover and cook, stirring frequently, for abour 10 minutes or until the apples soften. Add the port and simmer for 5 minutes more. Add the chicken stock, bouquet garni, and ham bone, if using. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for about 20 minutes, or until the flavors are well blended. Remove the bouquet garni. (The soup may be made a day or two in advance, up to this point. Cool and refrigerate. See detail 'A'.) Meanwhile in a small skillet, fry the bacon over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until browned and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Cut into l inch dice and set aside. Leaving the skin on, cut the green and red apples into 1/8-inch dice to use for garnish. You will need about 2 tablespoons of each color. Put the diced apples in a small glass or ceramic bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Set aside. In a small bowl, knead the softened butter and flour together until smooth to make a beurre manie'. Whisk the mixture into the soup to thicken it. Cook for 5 minutes longer, stirring frequently. Add the grated cheese to the soup, stirring constantly, until it is melted. Strain the soup through a fine sieve into the top of double boiler set over gently boiling water to keep the soup hot. (Do not press too hard on the solids.) season with the remaining lemon juice and salt and Tabasco to taste. Ladle the soup into warm serving bowls and garnish with the diced apples and chopped bacon. Serve hot. Detail 'A' continued: Add the Beurre manie and then the cheese and seasonings, when you reheat the soup for serving. Do not prepare the apple and bacon garnish until a few hours before serving. This soup can be completed up to 2 hours before serving, but keep it warm in the top half of a double boiler set over hot water. Do not simmer over direct heat after the cheese has been added or the soup will separate. Apple-Cheese Soup: Lunch or a light dinner.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE PRUNES</li>
      <li>12 ounces Ready To Use Prunes,; Without Stones</li>
      <li>3 ounces Caster Sugar</li>
      <li>5 fluid ounces Water</li>
      <li>3 fluid ounces Port Or Armagnac</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE STREUSEL TOPPING</li>
      <li>3 ounces Self-Rising Flour</li>
      <li>1 ounce Butter; At Room Temperature</li>
      <li>3 ounces Demerara Sugar</li>
      <li>2 ounces Whole Almonds, Halved And Shredded But untoasted; To Finish</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR THE CAKE</li>
      <li>3 ounces Self-Rising Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
      <li>2 ounces Butter; Soft</li>

      <li>1 Egg; Size 1</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Milk</li>
      <li>2 ounces Bramley Apple (Cooking Apples); Diced</li>
      <li>Icing Sugar; To Finish</li>
      <li>8 Inch Tin With A Loose Base, Greased And Lined with greaseproof paper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pre-heat oven to gas mark 4, 350F, 180 C. Although the ready-to-use prunes are not supposed to need soaking, we prefer to soak them just the same (the advantage is having them ready stoned). Start the recipe the night before you want to serve the cake by placing the prunes in a saucepan along with the sugar and water and simmer them very gently for 15 minutes. After that remove them to a bowl, add the armagnac, stir well, cover and leave overnight. When you're ready to make the cake, begin with the streusel topping: place the sifted flour and butter in a bowl and rub the butter in until the mixture becomes crumb like. Then add the sugar, mixing it in evenly, and after that sprinkle in one dessertspoon of cold water and fork the mixture until it is coarse and lumpy. Leave it to one side with the almonds. The cake mixture is very simple indeed - all you do is sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl, add the rest of the ingredients (except for the apple) then, using an electric hand whisk or a wooden spoon and some old-fashioned elbow grease, beat the mixture together until smooth. After that, fold in the apple, then spoon the mixture into the prepared tin. Now arrange the prunes all over the mixture, then fork the streusel topping over the prunes and finally sprinkle the shredded almonds evenly over the surface. Place the cake on the centre shelf of the oven, bake it for one hour, then remove from the oven. Leave it in the tin for 30 minutes before turning it out to cool on a wire rack. Just before serving sift the icing sugar over the surface.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 2/3 cups Whole wheat pastry flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Date sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Unsalted butter -- chilled</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Safflower oil</li>
      <li>1 Egg white</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>3 1/2 tablespoons Ice water</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Cranberries</li>
      <li>2 cups Sliced green apples</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Apple juice or apple brandy</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Dried currants or raisins</li>
      <li>1 cup Maple syrup</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Arrowroot powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon rind -- grated</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Ground almonds or walnuts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and date sugar. Make a well in center of dry ingredients and grate in butter and stir in oil. With fingers or a pastry mixer, combine butter and flour mixture until it is the texture of cornmeal. Do not overmix or butter will melt. Add egg white, vinegar, and enough of the ice water to form 8 small balls of dough. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10 minutes. 2. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine cranberries, apples, apple juice, currants, and maple syrup. Cook, uncovered, until berries pop. In a small bowl combine arrowroot with lemon juice and add to cranberries along with cinnamon and lemon rind. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let cool 10 minutes. 3. Lightly flour a counter or breadboard. Roll each ball of dough into a 6-inch circle and press into a 4-inch tart pan (preferably one with fluted edges). Fill two thirds full with cranberry filling and sprinkle with ground almonds. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool before serving. Makes 8 tarts. Note: Crunchy date sugar adds a fruity taste to the whole wheat pastry dough, but if it is not available, substitute an equal amount of maple sugar or honey.

      <li>by Prevention Magazine, http://www.healthyideas.com Before After Calories 317 159 Fat (g.) 10 2 % Calories from Fat 28% 11% Cholesterol (mg.) 69 46 In a small saucepan, combine the apple juice concentrate, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, thyme and hot- pepper sauce. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the sugar completely dissolves. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Place the chicken in a single layer in a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Pour about half of the cooled ketchup mixture over the chicken, turning once to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate both the chicken and the remaining ketchup mixture for 4 to 24 hours. Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Then light the grill according the manufacturer's directions. Check the temperature for grilling; the temperature should be medium-hot (see the Test Kitchen Tip below). Place the rack on the grill. Remove the chicken from the ketchup mixture; discard whatever ketchup mixture remains in the baking pan. Coat the chicken pieces with nonstick spray and brush them with some of the remaining ketchup mixture. Place the chicken on the rack and grill, uncovered, for 8 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brush with the remaining ketchup mixture. Grill for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Discard any remaining ketchup mixture. TEST KITCHEN TIP: When grilling, here's how to test the temperature of the coals: Place your hand 4 inches over the heat source. Count the number of seconds that the palm of your hand can withstand the heat before you have to remove your hand. For a hot temperature, that should be 2 seconds. For a medium-hot temperature, it should be 3 seconds. Medium heat would be 4 seconds, and low would be 5 seconds. To broil the chicken instead of grilling it, coat the rack of a broiling pan with nonstick spray. Remove the chicken from the ketchup mixture; discard whatever ketchup mixture remains in the baking pan. Coat the chicken pieces with nonstick spray and brush them with some of the remaining ketchup mixture. Place the chicken on the rack. Broil 4 inches from the heat for 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brush again with the remaining ketchup mixture. Broil for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Discard any remaining ketchup mixture. Makes 6 servings. Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n184 by "Tina D. Bell" &lt;tdbell@altair.csustan.edu&gt; on Jul 20, 1997</li>

Refrigerate or freeze remainder for later use. My grandmother just sent me a "store recipe" for Polenta (yes good spelling). This is from one of the old Italian food stores in Denver. Located in what, 30yrs ago, used to be the Italian section of Denver. Article goes on to talk about how polenta is the "spaghetti of north Italy", etc, etc... well, now for the way my grandfather (another Leo J. Girardi), and my family have always cooked it. Note: use course ground corn meal. You should be able to get it at a local Italian market.(I can't find it at King Soupers, Safeway, etc) Use large caste iron pot (dutch oven etc), I don't know if it will work with any thing else. :-) boil water with salt added. slowly pour in, while stirring, corn meal. Keep stirring and adding corn meal until thick. (note, use LARGE WOODEN spoon for stirring, known as a polenta stick -- This is what we were always threatened with when bad as children :) once cooked and thick. turn pan over, let cool a little. Slice like cake (into wedges) server with sauce and romano cheeze. Fry leftovers, cut into cubes, with onions, garlic, potatoes, eggs, etc. and server for breakfast. Good luck. It tastes great, but some people don't really understand it. Oh, sorry for no "amounts". My grandmother and grandfather taught me to cood by "Thats enough" or "A little more". never used a measuring cup, etc. File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

Add drained beans and boiling water to stockpot; add thyme, bay leaves and parsley. Cover and cook over low heat, adding boiling water occasionally if necessary, 1 1/2 - 3 hours or until beans are soft (cooking time varies with age of beans). When beans are soft add salt and pepper. For thicker soup remove about 1 1/2 cups of beans, puree in food processor or blender, and return to pot. For thinner soup add hot water (or crushed canned tomatoes with juices). Correct seasonings. Transfer soup to tureen or individual bowls. Garnish with chopped parsley or croutons and drizzle with a good green olive oil. Makes 8 servings. Notes: This recipe can be adapted to almost any kind of bean (cannellini, Great Northern, anasazi, _pinto_, pinquito, etc. are all possibilities).

    <title>"Official" Jewish Mother Chicken Soup</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 Kosher chicken cut into large hunks (I have never tried this with a non-kosher chicken, so I have no idea how soup from one would taste. However, it would taste somewhat different.)</li>
      <li>Several (3 to 6) large sharp white onions, cut or sliced.</li>
      <li>1 Carrots, chopped (optional) (up to 2)</li>
      <li>Enough water to cover the chicken</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: MATZOH BALLS</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Melted chicken fat or oil, approx (I think it's better if you use the fat from the soup.)</li>
      <li>2 large Eggs, slightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt, about</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Soup, about (not hot enough to cook the beaten eggs in the mixture--use the soup after it's been cooled in the fridge) or water (It tastes better if you use the soup)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Matzoh meal, about</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1) Place the chicken, onions, and carrots in a large stock pot. 2) Put the water into another pot. 3) Boil the water and pour it over the chicken, onions, and carrots. Make sure you put in just enough to cover the chicken and veggies in the pot; if you put in any more, the soup will be watery unless you boil off the excess water, which takes a while.) 4) Loosely cover or partially cover the stock pot and simmer for several hours--the longer, the better, usually. 5) Strain soup, pouring the liquid portion into a large pot. 6) Place pot with liquid in the fridge until it cools. 7) Take rendered chicken fat off the surface of the cooled soup. Reserve the fat. (An alternate way to separate the fat from the soup is to pour the soup into a measuring cup that has a spout at the bottom rather than at the top. This way, you can pour off the soup from the bottom of the measuring cup and leave the fat.) 8) Reheat soup to a boil and throw in matzoh balls and, if you like, onion, carrot,and/or chicken bits from earlier stages in making this soup. 9) Cook matzoh balls, add salt and pepper, and serve. MATZOH BALLS: 1) Blend fat and eggs together. 2) Add matzoh meal and salt, blend well. 3) Add soup stock and mix until uniform. 4) Cover mixing bowl and put it in the fridge for about 15-30 minutes. (The longer you leave the matzoh ball mixture in the fridge, the fluffier the matzoh balls turn out. My mom makes them fluffy, but some people like them dense.) 5) Make mixture into balls and drop them into boiling soup.(I don't think you need to make the mixture into balls; the matzoh balls taste just fine if you simply drop the mixture into the soup by spoonfuls.) 6) Boil for a few minutes--longer for a mixture that makes dense balls, esp. if you've made it into large balls, shorter if you're using a mixture that makes fluffier balls.) What to do with soup leftovers: If you've made a good chicken soup, you've boiled the chicken for a while, and the solid chicken now tastes like chewy nothing. Instead of throwing it all away, here's what we used to do with the remaining chicken: Curry Chicken with Coconut Raisin Rice: Cook some rice the way you ordinarily would, but add some unsweetened shredded coconut and raisins to the water when you go to boil the rice. Shred the chicken. It should fall apart easily. Heat a little vegetable oil in the bottom of a large frying pan. When the oil is hot, throw in some turmeric, some cumin seeds--either ground or whole--,some caraway seeds, and some sliced onion. Feel free to go a little heavy on the onion and spices; remember, you're going to be eating this with rice, and the chicken has no strong flavor of its own. If you don't have any of these particular spices on hand, just use sliced onion and curry powder. It'll still be OK. When the onion is translucent, add the shredded chicken and fry in the frying pan. Make sure to stir frequently; this stuff cooks quickly, since the chicken is already cooked. Add ground red pepper and stir through. Serve curried chicken with raisin coconut rice. This also tastes very good cold. Posted to Recipe Archive - 10 November 96 Date: Sun, 10 Nov 96 12:23:20 EST submitted by: silverman.30@osu.edu</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cook meat, drain, add taco seasoning and cook until liquid is absorbed. Add cheese. Arrange crescent rolls on a flat baking stone in a circle with bases overlapping in center and points to the outside - (unroll the crescent rolls and place the pointed triangle part on the stone overlapping each one) Spoon meat around in a circle and pull the square part of the crescent rolls over the meat, sealing it to look like a wreath. Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cut lettuce with garnisher and use v-shaped cutter to cut pepper. Chop onion and tomato with food chopper. Slice olives with egg slicer. Fill pepper with salsa and place in the center of the taco ring. Put lettuce around the pepper and arrange tomatoes, onions and olives on top. Add sour cream if you like. Cut with pizza cutter and serve with mini serving spatula. Because I was cooking for children, I left out the onions and peppers.
