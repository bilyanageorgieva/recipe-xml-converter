    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Bag; (5 lb.) self-rising flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 packages (1 qt.) dried milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Lard</li>
      <li>6 cups Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the first three ingredients well using a large shredder. Shred the shortening into the dry mix. Use a pastry blender and cut shortening into fine particles*. Add 6 cups water and stir - turn out on floured board (use part of dry mix as flour). Knead several times. Roll out 1/2-3/4 inch thickness. Cut out and place on ungreased cookie pan. Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes or until nicely browned - makes 5 dozen. This mixture can be made up and stored in large container. Measure out amount needed for biscuits, dumplings, etc., and add liquid as needed. The more moisture you can use the lighter your biscuits.

    <title>Baklava (Layered Pastry with Walnuts and Honey Syrup)</title>
    <category>Greek</category>
    <category>Desserts</category>
    <quantity>1 9x13</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>PASTRY:</li>
      <li>3/4 pounds Butter; three 1/4 lb. sticks</li>
      <li>;cut into 1/4 inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>40 Filo sheets; each about 16</li>
      <li>;inches long by 12 inches</li>
      <li>;wide</li>
      <li>4 cups Walnuts, shelled; pulverized</li>
      <li>;in a blender, nut grinder</li>
      <li>;or mortar/pestle</li>
      <li>SYRUP:</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice, fresh</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Honey</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Clarify the butter in a heavy saucepan or skillet in the following fashion: Melt the butter slowly over low heat without letting it brown, skimming off the foam as it rises to the surface. Remove the pan from the heat, let it rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then spoon off the clear butter and discard the milky solids at the bottom of the pan. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and stir the vegetable oil into the clarified butter. Using a pastry brush coat the bottom and sides of a 13 by 19 by 2 inch baking dish with about 1 tablespoon of the mixture. Fold a sheet of filo in half crosswise, lift it up gently and unfold it into the prepared dish. Press the pastry flat, fold down the excess around the sides and flatten it against the bottom. Brush the entire surface of the pastry lightly with the butter and oil mixture, and lay another sheet of filo on top, folding it down and buttering it in a similar fashion. Sprinkle the pastry evenly with about 3 tablespoons of walnuts. Repeat the same procedure using two sheets of buttered filo and 3 tablespoons of the pulverized walnuts each time to make 19 layers in all. Spread the 2 remaining sheets of filo on top and brush the baklava with all of the remaining butter and oil mixture. With a small, sharp knife score the top of the pastry with parallel diagonal lines about inch deep and 2 inches apart, then cross them diagonally to form diamond shapes. Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to about 300 and bake for 45 minutes longer, or until the top is crisp and golden brown. Syrup: Meanwhile, make the syrup. Combine the sugar, water and lemon juice in a small saucepan and, stirring constantly, cook over moderate heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to high and, timing it from the moment the sugar boils, cook briskly, uncovered, for about 5 minutes, or until the syrup reaches a temperature of 220 on a candy thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the honey. Pour the syrup into a bowl or pitcher and set aside. When the baklava is done, remove it from the oven and pour the syrup over it. Cool to room temperature, and just before serving, cut the baklava into diamond shaped serving pieces. 99 of 116 Source: Time Life Series: Middle Eastern Cooking "circa 69" MMed by: earl.cravens@salata.com</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 package Fillo dough</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Butter/margarine</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: NUT FILLING</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Pecans (or walnuts)</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cloves</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SYRUP</li>
      <li>1 cup Honey</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Water</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 small Piece of lemon peel</li>
      <li>1 small Piece of orange peel</li>
      <li>1 small Piece of cinnamon stick</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine and simmer the syrup ingredients for 10 minutes, cool and discard peels and cinnamon stick. Stir together the nut filling in a seperate bowl. Read the directions on the fillo dough box. It has a lot of hints on how to handle it. Brush one third of the sheets with butter and place on a buttered pan. Yes, butter each sheet. No, this is not fattening, the oven bakes off the calories. Spread 1/2 of the nut filling on the buttered sheets. Butter the next third, layer with the rest of the nut filling, and butter the last third. Make sure the top shett is buttered. With a sharp knife score the pastry into diamonds, do not cut through to the bottom. Bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes, or until it is puffed, crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oven and pour the cooled syrup over the top. Let stand 4 hours (yeah, right) and cut through to the bottom layer. Lessons Learned: 1. This is very easy to do, but tedious and time consuming. From start to finish it took 3 hours. 2. Work with a partner, one person buttering and one person placing sheets is a lot easier. 3. I didn't have a pan big enough for a full 14 x 18 inch sheet. I cut all sheets in half and used two pans, to make 14 x 9 inch sheets. 4. It seemed to be a little on the dry side, I might consider making more syrup next time. 5. Lock your partner in the other room while cooking or they will make themselves sick. It is that GOOD!!!

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mrs. W. R. Babb By this date, most people would have used commercial baking ponder, which was readily available. The flour in this mixture would make it thicken, as well as raise, a mixture. The staying power of this or any other baking powder is dependent on how well moisture is excluded from the powder. Sift all together six times; then put in cans and keep air tight. This is a good baking powder and will keep a long time.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Baking is probably the most common cooking method, but not necessarily the first thing you think of for cooking fish. It is a good choice though because it offers a wealth of variety. And you can bake fish with very little or no added fat. Unlike the moist heat of steaming or poaching, oven heat is dry, so your most important consideration is that the fish remains moist while cooking. There are many ways to do this beginning with an even coating of seasoned breadcrumbs or a quick brush with olive oil or melted butter. You can top the fish with thinly sliced tomatoes, zucchini, mushrooms or other vegetables, which help maintain the moisture in the fish as it cooks. You can even oven-poach fish by cooking it either partially or totally submerged in fish stock, wine or other liquid, covering the baking dish with foil, or laying buttered foil directly on top of the fish pieces. Wrapping the fish, in lettuce leaves, parchment paper or foil, is probably the best way to keep fish moist as it bakes. This in fact becomes oven-steaming because the moisture is sealed in. Baking is so versatile that virtually any fish or shellfish can be baked, from the thinnest fillets to oysters on the half-shell to the largest whole fish that your oven can accommodate. Smaller fillets or fish pieces should be baked at higher temperatures (about 425øF) to cook more quickly so there is less chance of drying out. Large pieces of fish and whole fish should be cooked at moderate temperatures (about 350øF) so the heat can penetrate to the interior of the fish without overcooking the exterior. How to Bake 1. Preheat the oven. Arrange the fish in an even layer in a lightly oiled or buttered baking dish, folding thin ends under if necessary to encourage even cooking. 2. Sprinkle the fish with the seasoning, coating, vegetables or whatever is called for in your recipe. 3. Bake the fish in the preheated oven until it is opaque through the thickest part of the fish. Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the fish and the accompanying ingredients. 4. Transfer the fish and vegetables, if appropriate, to individual plates. If there are any cooking juices remaining in the dish, spoon a little over the fish and serve.

Bake for 20-30 minutes until the fllling is set. This version of the Bakewell Pudding is often preferred both for its flavour and texture. The use of ground almonds makes the filling firmer. Another variation of this recipe uses 2 oz. self- raising flour and 2 oz. ground rice instead of the ground almonds.

      <li>Make dough first. In the bowl of a food processor, place the flour and salt. As machine runs, drop in the butter and pulse to create a grainy mixture. Add sour cream or yogurt and process only until a ball forms. Remove from machine and pat on a lightly floured board into a disc. Chill while preparing filling. Prepare onions by sauteeing in oil until golden. Do this slowly. Remove from heat. Boil potatores. Remove skins and mash well. Stir in beaten eggs, melted margarine, salt and pepper to taste and onions. Set aside. Using half the dough, roll out on a lightl floured board into a rectangle about 10 by 20 inches. Spread o horizontal edge with one-quarter of the potator mixture. Roll away from you, as for a jellyroll into the centre of the dough. Cut the dough in half, separating the rolled part (or jellyroll you have formed). Cut the roll into about 10 - 12 small pieces. Repeat with remaining ingredients to end up with four jellyrolls. Knishes can be frozen at the point and baked off as needed. Preheat oven to 350. On a lightly greased baking sheet, place the knishes on their ends, that is, cut side down and squish the kinish slightly on its end. Brush very lightly with melted margarine. Bake until almost golden, about 25 minutes, brush lightly with egg wash, return to oven and bake until nicely and evenly browned.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: ONION FILLING</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Peanut oil</li>
      <li>2 small Onions, (about 2/3 to 3/4 pound) peeled and finely diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh minced thyme or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled thyme</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Champagne Vinegar or white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: POTATOES</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds Russet potatoes, (about 5 medium) peeled</li>
      <li>2 ounces Unsalted butter, (1/2 stick) melted</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>For the Onion Filling, place a heavy medium saucepan on medium low heat and add the oil. Add the onions and thyme, cover and cook until very tender, for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the vinegar, bring to a boil and stir until absorbed. Season with salt and pepper. (This can be prepared ahead, cooled, covered and set aside at room temperature.) For the potatoes, carefully cut potatoes into thin, even slices using a knife, a mandoline or a food processor with a slicing blade. Place in a large bowl of cold water. (This can be prepared to this point and set aside at room temperature in bowl covered with cold water. Drain before continuing with the recipe.) To cook, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Dry the drained potatoes well in a lettuce spinner and a clean bath towel. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Trace four 5 inch circles on the parchment with dark ink. Turn the paper over. If the circles are not visible, redraw them so they are. Brush the circles lightly with butter. Overlap the potatoes to cover the bottom of each circle, using the least attractive slices for the center. Brush lightly with butter. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the onions among the centers of the circles. Flatten onions to 1/8 inch thick circles using a spatula. Overlap 1 layer of potatoes around the rim of each circle, leaving part of the onion center exposed. Brush the top layer of potatoes lightly with butter. Season with salt and pepper. Press down on the top layer, sealing it to the bottom layer. Bake until brown and crisp, for about 30 minutes. Press the layers together and neaten edges several times while baking. To serve, slide a long narrow spatula under the potatoes to loosen them from the paper. Switch to a broad spatula and carefully transfer the potatoes to 4 small or main course plates, neatening the edges if necessary. Serve immediately.

      <li>1 pound Unsalted butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Recipe By : TAMALES WORLD TOUR In a saucepan, combine 3 cups of the sugar, the water, honey, lemon juice cinnamon stick and whole cloves, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick and cloves, and let cool. In a large bowl, combine the walnuts, almonds, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, ground cinnamon, and ground cloves and set aside. Unroll the filo dough on a flat surface and keep it covered with waxed paper and a damp towel so it doesn't dry out and become brittle. Remove 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and refrigerate for the top layer. Using a pastry brush, brush a 15 1/2 by 11 1/2 by 3 inch baking pan with some of the melted butter. Lay a filo sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with butter, and repeat using a total of 8 sheets. Sprinkle a handful of the nut mixture over the top filo sheet. Layer 3 more filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with a handful of the nut mixture. Continue until all the filo sheets and nuts are used, being sure to brush each sheet with butter. Use the reserved 8 sheets of filo for the last, top layer. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Using a long, very sharp knife, cut the baklava into small diamonds: First make 6 evenly spaced lengthwise cuts. Cut straight down until the tip of the knife touches the bottom of the pan, and keeping the knife straight, cut in a straight line all the way. Next, cut diagonally across the lengthwise cuts to form diamonds, starting in one corner and making cuts until you reach the opposite corner. Heat the remaining butter until it bubbles and pour it over the top of the pastry. Bake for 1 1/4 hours or until evenly golden and flaky. Remove to a rack and spoon the cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve pieces individually, placing them in decorative paper cups if desired.

      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In medium bowl, combine baking mix and milk; stir until blended. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead briefly (about 10 times). With lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough out to 1/2-inch thickness. Using 2 1/2-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter, cut out dough. Place biscuits about 2-inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake until golden about 10 minutes. Serve warm. Makes 6 biscuits. Note: These biscuits can be served as a side dish or quick snack. They are also great split and filled with savory ingredients for sandwiches or with sliced, seasonal fruit for dessert. PER BISCUIT: 145CAL.; 4G PROT.; 4G TOTAL FAT (1G SAT. FAT); 23G CARB.; 3MG CHOL.; 163MG SOD.; 1G FIBER. LACTO Abstract: The magazine staff took a traditional Bisquick-style baking mix and modified it to include whole grains and less salt. The new recipe can be used to make muffins, pancakes and bread. For moistness, we used light stick margarine, whic also helps to reduce the fat content. A vegan variation is as follows: Prepare the mix using vegan margarine and omit the powdered milk. When you're ready to prepare biscuits, pancakes, etc., add 1/2 cup water, soy or rice milk for every 2 cups of mix. The staff found that the baking mix made great biscuits, pancakes and muffins. With the use of leftover vegetables, fruit, spices, nuts, cheeses and herbs, the possible variations on these themes are endless. Source: Vegetarian Times, Sep 1997 n241 p32(2).

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>1 package Fillo Dough</li>
      <li>1 pound Unsalted; melted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped walnuts or pecans</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: SYRUP</li>
      <li>2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix the 1 cup sugar and 1 cup walnuts, set aside. Butter 9"x13" pan with pastry brush. Unwrap thawed fillo dough. Take first layer and fold in half, place in pan. Butter this layer with melted butter using pastry brush. Continue folding each layer and buttering each one until you get to about 12-13. Take your sugar and nuts and pour evenly on top. Continue using the rest of the sheets of dough one at a time, folding, and buttering. When your finished with all the dough, take a sharp knife and cut diamond shape on top and all the way through. Sometimes the very top layer of dough will move around, just put it back with your fingers. When done cutting, pour remaining melted butter all over the top. Bake in 325 degrees oven for 1 1/2 hours. As soon as you put the Baklava in the oven make your syrup. It;s important to make it now because you want the syrup to be completely cooled before pouring it on or the flaky dough will be mush. So boil the 2 cup sugar and 1 cup water until its bubbly and clear. Then add 1/2 tsp. lemon juice. When the HOT Baklava is done pour the cool syrup in the cracks and around the edges and a little on top. ENJOY!!

    <quantity>60</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>1 Lemon rind</li>
      <li>1 Stick cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 Whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds Walnuts &amp; blanched almonds Chopped medium fine</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Commercial filo sheets</li>
      <li>1 pound Sweet butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine 3 cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices in a saucepan and bring to boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and ground spices and set aside. Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed paper and then a damp towel. Keep covered except when removing to assemble the baklava. Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and refrigerate to reserve for the top. Using a large pastry brush, butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch by 3-inch baking pan. Lay a filo sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with warm butter, and repeat using 8 sheets. Scoop up a handful of the nut-spice mixture and sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan. Lay on 3 or more filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with the nut mixture. Continue until all the nuts and filo are used. (The important things here are to butter each filo and spread the nuts evenly. The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times during the procedure.) Now you can remove the reserved sheets from the refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet. Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom into diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired. Be sure the knife touches the bottom of the pan as you cut. Heat the remaining butter to sizzling and pour over the top. Bake in a 300 degree oven for 1 1/4 hours or until golden chestnut in color and flaky. Remove from the oven (in the pan) to a rack, and spoon the cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve each piece individually.

Gray) Date: 22 Mar 1995 19:18:33 -0600 To make a frosting that is the type you get on a purchased cake, try this: To this you may add 1 tsp. of flavor such as almond extract or white vanilla. This will make it slightly thinner. This frosting may then be spread on a cake and with a little food coloring, be used as a decorating frosting. Remember, this is not low in calories.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: PASTRY</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup Solid vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Ice water</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FILLING</li>
      <li>3 Medium sized eggs, at room</li>
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Superfine sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter at room temperature</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Ground almonds</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (Heaping) good-quality</li>
      <li>Strawberry preserves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>PASTRY: Measure out the flour and put to one side. In a large mixing bowl, place the fat, water and 3 heaped tablespoons of the flour you set to one side. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until all is well blended. The carefully add in the rest of the flour, rubbing the mixture between your fingertips until it all sticks together. You can add up to 2 tablespoons of water to help, but no more. Remember that if you overwork the pastry at this stage it will become tough and shrink when cooked. Combine into a ball, cover with a damp tea towel and place in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 400F. Beat the eggs and sugar together until creamy (this takes about 3 minutes). Add the butter in small pieces, and the almonds, and continue to beat for another minute until all is combined. Set aside. On a lightly floured working surface, roll out the pastry into a circle so that it's 3 inches larger than the baking tin, and about 1/8" thick. Lightly grease the tin, making sure you smear a very thin film all over the inside. Now transfer the pastry to the bin by carefully rolling it around the rolling pin. Be careful, it's not always easy; but if the pastry breaks a bit, don't worry - you can do a repair job when it's in the tin. Now with your hands fashion it to the inside of the tin, making sure it reaches inside the corners. Cut off the excess pastry with a knife. You will hae pastry left over; roll it into a ball and freeze for next time. In a small saucepan gently melt the jam so it will spread more easily. Distribute the jam evenly over the pastry in the tin and then cover the preserve with the egg mixture. Now bake in the center of your oven for 25-30 minutes. It's done when the filling has set and is a mid to deep brown all over. If it starts to brown on one side and not the other, turn the pie halfway through cooking (do this quickly or all the heat will escape). This means that you'll have to keep an eye on it while it's in the oven. You can serve this with whipped heavy cream - it tastes not unlike pumpkin pie, but with an almond flavor.

      <li>8 Scallions; (green part only)</li>
      <li>2 cups Freshly grated parmesan cheese; (about 6 ounces)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Chop yellow bell peppers and onion and mince garlic. In a 3 to 4-quart heavy saucepan cook yellow peppers, onion, and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil, covered, over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until peppers are soft, about 30 minutes. Stir in cream. In a blender puree mixture in batches (use caution when blending hot liquids), transferring to a large bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Sauce may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before proceeding. Thinly slice mushrooms lengthwise and cut red and orange bell peppers into 1/4-inch wide strips. In a deep large heavy skillet cook mushrooms and peppers in remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until peppers are softened and most of liquid is evaporated, about 8 minutes, and season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Fill a 6 to 7 quart kettle three fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in ziti and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water and drain ziti well in a colander. Rinse ziti and drain well. Thinly slice scallion greens. Into sauce stir ziti, mushroom mixture, scallion greens, 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, reserved cooking water, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon mixture into a 3 quart shallow baking dish and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Bake ziti in middle of oven until hot and pasta begins to brown, about 20 minutes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine these ingredients thoroughly and store in jar. Makes 1 1/4 cups of baking powder. The arrowroot repels moisture, so it keeps well. To make baking powder for immediate use, combine 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar with 1/4 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda. This is the equivalent of 1 teaspoon of commercial baking powder and has 225 milligrams of sodium. To make sodium-free baking powder, eliminate the sodium bicarbonate and substitute potassium bicarbonate which is available at pharmacies.

      <li>2 tablespoons Marshmallow creme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla (cake decorators and bakeries use clear to make the icing really white)</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: TILLIE ELIZABETH HORAK &lt;thorak@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu&gt; Date: 19 May 1995 20:49:45 -0600 I do cake decorating and the recipe I use is as follows (it usually does have that thin crust that Patty was looking for): Cream the shortening and flavorings together. Then add the sugar, a little at a time, until the mixture begins to look like coarse crumbs. Then add salt water a little at a time until the mixture begins to get smooth and becomes the consistency of icing. Cake decorators generally like their icing on the stiff side, but it is a matter of personal taste. Add the salt water until it is the consistency you want. After you ice the cake, and it sits for a couple of hours, it should have that "micro-thin" crust your looking for. As a personal side note, I usually add more liquid vanilla flavoring and butter flavoring to my icing, because I want the taste, not the terrible sweetness of some icings. Almond extract can also be used in place of the vanilla, if you want to try something a little different. If you do use almond, I'd use less than the vanilla, because it tends to be a stronger flavoring. Note: Van-o-van is a powdered vanilla flavoring that is used (as far as I know) only by cake decorators. Every cake decorating store that I have been in has it in stock. I'm not really sure of the significance of it on the whole, perhaps Wilton could answer that. I do know that if you add more than what the recipe calls for, it makes your icing bitter. I have run out of it before and can certainly tell the difference. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /CAKES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>2 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>1 Lemon rind</li>
      <li>1 Stick cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 Whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds Walnuts &amp; blanched almonds Chopped medium fine</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Commercial filo sheets</li>
      <li>1 pound Sweet butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine 3 cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices in a saucepan and bring to boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and ground spices and set aside. Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed paper and then a damp towel. Keep covered except when removing to assemble the baklava. Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and refrigerate to reserve for the top. Using a large pastry brush, butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch by 3-inch baking pan. Lay a filo sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with warm butter, and repeat using 8 sheets. Scoop up a handful of the nut-spice mixture and sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan. Lay on 3 or more filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with the nut mixture. Continue until all the nuts and filo are used. (The important things here are to butter each filo and spread the nuts evenly. The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times during the procedure.) Now you can remove the reserved sheets from the refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet. Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom into diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired. Be sure the knife touches the bottom of the pan as you cut. Heat the remaining butter to sizzling and pour over the top. Bake in a 300 degree oven for 1 1/4 hours or until golden chestnut in color and flaky. Remove from the oven (in the pan) to a rack, and spoon the cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve each piece individually.

      <li>SINCE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE DECREASES AS ALTITUDE INCREASES, THE REQUIREMENT FOR BAKING SODA ALSO DECREASES. BAKERY MIXES ARE FORMULATED FOR USE AT SEA LEVEL AIR PRESSURE. A REDUCTION IN THE SODA CONTENT OF MIXES AT HIGHER ALTITUDES IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED WITH MIXES CONTAINING A SEPARATE SODA PACKET. IF THE SODA PACKET IS NOT LABELED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AMOUNT OF SODA TO BE USED AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES, USE THE FOLLOWING AS A GUIDE: 2000 FEET --- USE 80 % (4/5 OF PACKAGE) 4000 FEET --- USE 66 % (2/3 OF PACKAGE) 6000 FEET --- USE 55 % (1/2 OF PACKAGE) 8000 FEET --- USE 35 % (1/3 OF PACKAGE) WHEN PREPARING CAKES, HOT BREADS, AND DROP COOKIES FROM BASIC INGREDIENTS AT HIGH ALTITUDES, QUANTITIES OF LEAVENING AGENTS MAY BE ADJUSTED AS SPECIFIED IN THE TABLE ON THE BACK OF THIS CARD. CAKES HAVE A TENDANCY TO STICK TO PANS AT HIGHER ALTITUDES; THEREFORE, THE PANS SHOULD BE GREASED AND DUSTED MORE HEAVILY THAN THOSE USED AT SEA LEVEL. OVEN TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE INCREASED 25 DEGREES F. AT ELEVATIONS OF 3500 FEET OR MORE. THE BAKING TIME IS GENERALLY THE SAME AS AT SEA LEVEL; HOWEVER, CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AVOID OVERBAKING SINCE EVAPORATION RATE INCREASES AT HIGHER ALTITUDES. BAKING POWDER OR BAKING SODA IN RECIPES FOR CAKES, HOT BREADS, AND DROP COOKIES PREPARED AT HIGHER ALTITUDES SHOULD BE DECREASED AS FOLLOWS: : AMOUNT IN AMOUNTS TO BE USED AT HIGHER ALTITUDES BASIC RECIPE 2000 FEET 4000 FEET 6000 FEET 8000 FEET : 1 TBSP 2 1/2 TSP 2 TSP 1 2/3 TSP 1 TSP 1 2/3 TBSP 1 2/3 TBSP 1 1/3 TBSP 1 TBSP 2 TSP 2 TBSP 1 2/3 TBSP 1 1/3 TBSP 3 1/3 TSP 2 1/2 TSP 2 1/3 TBSP 2 TBSP 1 2/3 TBSP 1 1/3 TBSP 2 2/3 TSP 3 2/3 TBSP 3 TBSP 2 2/3 TBSP 2 TBSP 1 1/3 TBSP 4 TBSP 3 1/3 TBSP 2 2/3 TBSP 2 1/3 TBSP 1 2/3 TBSP 4 2/3 TBSP 3 2/3 TBSP 3 TBSP 2 2/3 TBSP 1 2/3 TBSP 5 2/3 TBSP 4 2/3 TBSP 3 2/3 TBSP 3 TBSP 2 1/3 TBSP 6 2/3 TBSP 5 2/3 TBSP 4 2/3 TBSP 3 2/3 TBSP 2 2/3 TBSP 1/2 CUP 6 2/3 TBSP 5 2/3 TBSP 4 1/3 TBSP 3 1/3 TBSP 8 2/3 TBSP 7 1/3 TBSP 6 TBSP 4 2/3 TBSP 3 1/3 TBSP 9 TBSP 7 2/3 TBSP 6 1/3 TBSP 5 TBSP 3 2/3 TBSP 11 TBSP 9 1/3 TBSP 7 2/3 TBSP 6 TBSP 4 1/3 TBSP 3/4 CUP 5/8 CUP 1/2 CUP 6 2/3 TBSP 5 TBSP 1 CUP 7/8 CUP 11 1/3 TBSP 8 2/3 TBSP 6 1/3 TBSP 1 1/2 CUPS 1 1/4 CUPS 1 CUP 13 1/3 TBSP 5/8 CUP Recipe Number: A01400 SERVING SIZE: 100 From the &lt;Army Master Recipe Index File&gt; (actually used today!).

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a fraction of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats, sugar, and nuts. The results will fool anyone. 1. Combine pistacho nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small bowl. Using half of filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to prevent from drying out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased 13x9" baking sheet. Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly with nut mixture. Place remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing after every third sheet and top sheet. 2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form pattern of about 35 diamond shapes. Bake at 400'F. 25 minutes or until golden. Place on wire rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup evenly over top and allow to soak several hours. Stud each diamond-shape with whole clove. Each piece baklava with syrup contains about: 85 calories; 32mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 9 grams carbohydrate; 2 grams protein; trace fiber. Exchanges: 1/2 bread; 1/2 fat.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>1 Lemon rind</li>
      <li>1 Stick cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 Whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds Walnuts &amp; blanched almonds*</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Commercial filo sheets</li>
      <li>1 pound Sweet butter, melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Note- Walnuts and almonds should be chopped medium fine. Combine 3 cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices in a saucepan and bring to boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and ground spices and set aside. Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed paper and then a damp towel. Keep covered except when removing to assemble the baklava. Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and refrigerate to reserve for the top. Using a large pastry brush, butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch by 3-inch baking pan. Lay a filo sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with warm butter, and repeat using 8 sheets. Scoop up a handful of the nut-spice mixture and sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan. Lay on 3 or more filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with the nut mixture. Continue until all the nuts and filo are used. (The important things here are to butter each filo and spread the nuts evenly. The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times during the procedure.) Now you can remove the reserved sheets from the refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet. Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom into diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired. Be sure the knife touches the bottom of the pan as you cut. Heat the remaining butter to sizzling and pour over the top. Bake in a 300 degree oven for 1 1/4 hours or until golden chestnut in color and flaky. Remove from the oven (in the pan) to a rack, and spoon the cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve each piece individually.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Submitted by: Cookie Recipe.com Staff This Near Eastern pastry is made of many layers of paper-thin dough with a filling usually of honey and ground nuts. If you like honey, you'll probably like Baklava. 1 Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. 2 Melt the butter over low heat. Pour 2 tablespoons of the butter into the bottom of a 13 x 9 inch baking pan. Layer 3 sheets of the phyllo dough in the pan. Trim dough to fit. 3 Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of pecans over the phyllo dough. 4 Layer 3 more sheets of dough and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of pecans. Continue dough - pecan layers until pan is 3/4 full. 5 With a sharp knife, score phyllo dough to form diamonds. Press a clove at each end of the diamonds. Pour remaining butter over the dough. 6 Bake 45 to 50 minutes, until dough is golden brown. 7 While dough is baking, combine the sugar, water and cinammon stick in medium saucepan and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Simmer for 10 minutes. 8 Add the honey and simmer for 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon stick. 9 Pour honey mixture over hot baklava. Let cool on wire racks. Cut into diamonds.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Grease 13" by 9" baking pan. In large bowl, mix walnuts, sugar and cinnamon, set aside. In baking pan, place 1 sheet of phyllo, allowing it to extend up sides of pan; brush with butter or margarine. Repeat to make 5 more layers; sprinkle with 1 cup walnut mixture. Cut remaining phyllos into approximately 13" by 9" rectangles if desired; otherwise, just be sure to butter the edges so you can fold them over after you add the filling. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place one phyllo rectangle in pan; brush with butter or margarine. Repeat to make at least 6 layers, overlapping small strips of phyllo to make rectangels, if necessary. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the walnut mixture. Repeat step 3 three more times. Place remaining phyllo on top of last walnut layer. Trim any phyllo that extends over top of pan. With sharp knife, cut just halfway through all layers in a diamond pattern to make 24 servings. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until top is golden brown. Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan over medium hear, heat honey until hot, not boiling. Spoon hot honey evenly over baklava. Cool in pan on wire rack at least 1 hour, then cover and leave at room temperature until serving time. To serve: Finish cutting through layers.

      <li>1/2 cups Apple fiber</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Baking Powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Rice bran</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Evaporated skim milk</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From the 8 Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook. Tastes best right out of the oven. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, rice bran, apple fiber, and salt. Or you could do this in a food processor. Add milk all at once and stir until ingredients are just combined; if you are doing this in a food processor, pulse the machine a few times just until dough is combined. If the dough seems a little dry, sprinkle on a tablespoon of water and work it in. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 30 seconds. Then pat and push it out until it is 1/2 inch thick. With a 1 1/2 inch biscuit cutter, cut the dough into about 18 rounds. Set rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 16 minutes or until cooked through. VARIATIONS: To make herbed bisuits, add 1 tsp dried herbs of your choice to the dry ingredients, before adding the milk. To make buttermilk bisbuits, use 1% fat buttermilk instead of the evaporated milk and substitute 2 tsp baking powder, mixed with 1/2 tsp baking soda, for the baking powder. To make oat-bran biscuits, substitute 1 cup oat bran for the rice bran and apple fiber.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
      <li>1 Lemon rind</li>
      <li>1 Stick cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 Whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds Walnuts &amp; blanched almonds Chopped medium fine</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds Commercial filo sheets</li>
      <li>1 pound Sweet butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine 3 cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices in a saucepan and bring to boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and ground spices and set aside. Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed paper and then a damp towel. Keep covered except when removing to assemble the baklava. Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and refrigerate to reserve for the top. Using a large pastry brush, butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch by 3-inch baking pan. Lay a filo sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with warm butter, and repeat using 8 sheets. Scoop up a handful of the nut-spice mixture and sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan. Lay on 3 or more filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with the nut mixture. Continue until all the nuts and filo are used. (The important things here are to butter each filo and spread the nuts evenly. The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times during the procedure.) Now you can remove the reserved sheets from the refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet. Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom into diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired. Be sure the knife touches the bottom of the pan as you cut. Heat the remaining butter to sizzling and pour over the top. Bake in a 300 degree oven for 1 1/4 hours or until golden chestnut in color and flaky. Remove from the oven (in the pan) to a rack, and spoon the cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve each piece individually.

Divid the crumb mixture into 2, 9" vegetable sprayed pie pans and press evenly on the bottom and up the sides. I prefer not TOO thick a crust. Bake at 350 F. for 15 minutes. Cool. Fill with any kind of filling you like. These would freeze well, tightly wrapped.

    <title>Baked Tomatoes Stuffed with Salmon, Garlic, and Capers</title>
    <category>Cooking liv</category>
    <category>Import</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 tablespoon Capers; preferably packed in salt</li>
      <li>1 pound Salmon</li>
      <li>3 1/2 tablespoons Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Very finely chopped garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fine; dry, unflavored bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Black pepper ground fresh</li>
      <li>2 large Ripe; firm tomatoes, weighting approximately 3/4 pound each</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Drain the capers if packed in vinegar; soak, rinse, and drain if packed in salt; then chop them fine. Turn the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the salmon's skin, remove any loose membranes, and carefully pick out all bones. Cut the fish into very small dice and put it in a bowl together with 2 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, the chopped parsley, garlic, capers, 1 tablespoon of bread crumbs, salt, and several grindings of black pepper. Toss thoroughly. Wash the tomatoes, cut them in half horizontally, scoop out all the seeds and the centers to make a cup-like hollow. (If you are cooking anything else that day or the next that calls for fresh tomatoes, use the scoopings in the recipe.) Pat the inside of the tomatoes with paper towels to soak up excess juice, then stuff them with the salmon mixture, pressing it down lightly as you do so. There should be enough to form a mound. Sprinkle the tops with the remaining bread crumbs and drizzle with the remaining olive oil, holding back a few drops to smear the bottom of a baking pan. Place the tomatoes on the baking pan and bake in the upper level of the preheated oven for 35 minutes or until the salmon stuffing has formed a light golden crust. Serve not piping hot, but lukewarm. They are also good later, at room temperature, but not reheated.

      <li>1 medium Carrot, peeled and cut into 4-inch sticks</li>
      <li>4 Green onions, cut into 3-inch sections</li>
      <li>8 Quarter-size slices ginger (no need to peel)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Whole allspice</li>
      <li>3 Star anise pods, broken up</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Whole peppercorns</li>
      <li>2 small Dried chiles, any loose seeds removed</li>
      <li>2 Tilapia, cleaned and scaled (2 1/2 to 3 pounds in all)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons White wine</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fish or poultry stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Butter (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This will work with other whole lean fish, including small rockfish or farmed striped bass, and cuts or 'roasts' of halibut or pink salmon. Adjust the cooking time according to the thickness and density of the fish. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub a baking dish well with the oil, add the vegetables and whole spices, and toss to coat them lightly with oil. Arrange in an even layer. Rinse the fish well inside and out, pat dry, season lightly with salt, and place on top of the vegetables. Add the wine and 3 tablespoons of the stock. Make a loose tent of foil over the tail of the fish and place in the oven. Bake, rotating the pan once halfway through the cooking time, until a skewer easily enters the thickest part of the fish, 25 to 30 minutes. If you have an instant-reading thermometer, it should read 145 degrees F.to 150 degrees F.in the center near the bone. Transfer the fish to a warm serving platter. Strain the contents of the baking dish into a small saucepan; discard the spices and vegetables. Add the remaining stock, bring to a boil and reduce by a third. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Swirl in the butter if desired and pour over and around the fish on the platter.

      <li>Here's a favorite recipe for using "leftover" turkey that's been in my repertoire since the 1959 issue of WOMEN'S DAY, where it first appeared: Cook the rice as usual. Make a sauce with next 4 ingredients. Add mushrooms, parsley, onion, sage, and half the cheese. Stir until cheese is melted. Stir in rice and turkey; season with salt and pepper to taste. Put in shallow baking dish, and sprinkle remaining cheese and paprika on top. Bake in 374-degree oven about 30 minutes. (Good with zucchini, sliced tomatoes, apple crunch/crisp.)

In a flat pan or nonstick baking dish just large enough to hold the slices in a single layer, combine the lime juice, soy sauce, honey, ginger, garlic and chili sauce. Place the tofu in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 2 or up to 6 hours, turning occasionally. Preheat the oven to 350F. Remove the dish from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature. Bake for 45 minutes. Makes 4 servings. Per sv: 108 cal; 2g fat; 1054mg sodium. NOTE: There is now a lower fat tofu on the market which would lower the fat content (I don't mean Mori-Nu - I'm not sure of the brand - maybe White Wave?).

      <li>From: Wendy Lockman &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt; Date: Sun, 11 Feb 1996 10:35:49 -0500 Choose a baking dish or other shallow oven-proof dish suitable for bringing to table, which is just large enough to take the trout in a single layer when they are arranged head to tail. Thoroughly dry the fish with plenty of kitchen paper. Make a frying pan very hot, barely smear it with fat and fry the fish briefly, one or two at a time, just long enough to brown their skins well on both sides. Transfer the fish to the ovenproof dish, arranging them neatly. Cover and store in a cool place. Chop the herbs and mix them gently in a small saucepan. Measure the yoghurt and cream and pour them over the herbs. Add plenty of pepper and some salt and stir to mix well. Cover and leave to infuse. Everything up to this stage can be done in advance, but be sure to bring both the pan of sauce and the dish of trout back to room temperature about 1 hour before they are to be put back into the oven for cooking. (Foods that are transferred straight from the fridge to cooker take a very long time to heat through properly.) About 1/2 hour before you plan to serve the trout, bring the yoghurt-and- herb mixture very slowly to simmering point, stirring all the while. Pour the aromatic mixture over the fish, cover the dish and bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 20-25 minutes until the fish are piping hot and cooked through. (To check a trout for readiness, insert the tip of a knife into its flesh just behind the head.) Serve with steamed new potatoes and other young summer vegetables such as carrots and peas.

(If the tortillas are fresh, dry them by spreading them on a baking sheet and letting them sit out, room temperature, for 1 hour or more.) Briefly dip the tortilla pieces into the brine, then shake off the excess water. (A longer soaking in the brine will make the tortillas take on a more pronounced flavor.)

      <li>From: viv@tauon.ph.unimelb.edu.au (Viviane Buzzi) Date: Wed, 23 Nov 1994 11:56:03 +0000 This is a simple way I like to prepare them which I think is delicious, although I don't usually fillet them....just clean/gut them etc...: Place the trout or fillets onto a large enough piece of foil to wrap in. Brush the foil with some virgin olive oil and brush the fish with some oil too. Season it with some salt and black pepper. Finely chop the herbs with the garlic to make a herb/garlic pesto and sprinkle over the trout to cover completely. Or, if using whole trout, stuff into the cavity. Lay a few thin slices of lemon over the top and wrap the foil tightly. Place in a baking dish and bake in the oven until done...this depends on the size of the fish so I don't know how long....it could take around 20 minutes or so on average. When cooked, remove from the foil, remove the lemon slices and drizzle some more olive oil over the top if you wish and serve with wedges of lemon.

Let sauce cool; add chopped chicken, egg yolk, salt and celery salt. Form into twelve small cones. Mix bread crumbs with ground sage. Roll cones in crumbs. Beat egg; add water. Dip each cone in egg and roll again in crumbs. Place on greased baking pan and drizzle with melted butter. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. NOTES : A good way to use up leftover turkey, chicken, or ham. If using ham, put through a meat grinder and use 1-1/2 cups ground ham.

      <li>From: dferrell@eleven.uccs.edu (Diane M. Ferrell) Date: 18 Nov 1994 18:31:39 -0500 The last time we had some fresh trout I baked it with basil and onions and everyone loved it. We didn't filet the trout, so it was baked whole, but I imagine you could use the recipe for the filets. Soak the trout in salt water for 15 minutes. Rinse well and scrape the skin lightly. Rinse again. Salt and pepper the cavity. Thinly slice the onion and place several slices inside the cavity. Clean the basil and coarsly chop. Place the basil in the cavity also. Use about 4-5 very large leaves. Place the trout in a baking pan with just a small amount of water. Cover will foil and bake at 350 degrees. These were extremely large trout that my brother had caught. They were over a pound each and about 18" long. I baked them for about 25 minutes. During the last 10 minutes of baking time I spread the garlic-almond butter on top, recoved with the foil and baked for 5 minutes more. The last five minutes I removed the foil. Garlic-almond butter: Puree the garlic and butter together in the processor then put in a heavy skillet on medium high heat. When the butter begins to sizzle add the slivered almonds and toast until just beginning to turn golden. Remove &gt;from the heat and add the lemon and mix well. I would think that you could salt and pepper the filets, lay them in a baking dish, then cover with basil then onions and the foil. The filets would not take nearly so long to bake--maybe 15 minutes with the last few minutes baking uncovered and with the garlic-almond butter on. Fresh water trout is done when it flakes easily apart. But, as with all fish, it doesn't take very long to cook. REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES /FISH From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>I want to share a really yummy recipe I adapted from Laxmi's Vegetarian Kitchen by Laxmi Hiremath. ( It was practically fatfree to begin with.) I left out the jalapenos and salt for my family but tried them with heat for myself...they're good either way! Preheat oven to 400 degrees Combine kofta ingredients and mix thoroughly, form into 1 inch balls and bake 1 inch apart non-stick baking sheet until golden, about 30 min. Meanwhile, blend together 1st 5 gravy ingredients in a blender with 1 cup water. In sauce pan on med-high put mustard seeds and heat until they start to pop, then add blended ingredients. cook 5 min and add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer for 10 min. Cool koftas for 5 min. Pour gravy into a serving dish, add koftas and serve hot. I served this with a basmati rice green pea pilaf and a vegie curry. It was so yummy, my family scarffed them up before anything else!

Lightly sprinkle into each tomato a little sugar, salt, pepper and oregano; place four cubes of mozzarella in each tomato. Preheat oven to 400-degrees. Melt the butter in a saucepan and saute the onion in it until soft; stir in the orzo, stirring well so each grain of pasta is coated. Pour in 2 cups of the chicken broth, stir well, and simmer until it is absorbed, adding more broth gradually until the orzo is about three quarters cooked; firmer than al dente (I cooked mine longer--don't like pasta that firm). Taste it as you go and cook until it's as firm as you like. Blend in the Parmesan, stirring it in well. Spoon the orzo mixture into the hollowed tomatoes, filling them. Place the filled tomatoes in a casserole or baking dish with 1/2 cup of hot broth in the bottom of the dish. Bake, covered, for 15 minutes; remove the cover and cook an additional 10 minutes.

      <li>Date: Mon, 19 Feb 96 14:29:57 CST From: coldiron@bangate.compaq.com Tried a new recipe last night that was good, although a little ginger-y for our tastes. Since there are a number of ginger lovers on this list, thought I'd share! From Prevention's Quick and Healthy Low-Fat Cooking (Mediterranean). Combine all ingredients. Bake in 8x8" baking dish at 400øF for 20 minutes. The original recipe called for 1 tablespoon olive oil and a non-stick-sprayed baking dish, neither of which we used. No sticking, no problems.

    <title>Baked Yeast Doughnuts</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 packages Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Milk; scalded</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Nutmeg (up to 2)</li>
      <li>4 3/4 cups Flour (up to 5)</li>
      <li>Melted butter or margarine</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Dissolve yeast in the lukewarm water. Add butter to scalded milk and cool to lukewarm. Add yeast. Beat eggs; add sugar and beat again; add to milk. Add salt, nutmeg and beat in thoroughly, adding enough flour to make a very soft dough. Cover and let rise in warm place until double in bulk. Or let rise in refrigerator until double in bulk, about 3 1/2 hours. Cut with a well-floured doughnut cutter or cut in rectangles about 1 1/2 inch wide and 4 inches long. Place about 2 inches apart on well greased cookie sheet. Brush well with the melted butter or margarine. Let rise in warm place until double in bulk. Bake in 425 degree oven about 12 minutes or until lightly browned. Roll in sugar or frost with powdered sugar frosting. Makes 3 dozen. I use the canned frosting a lot. I tint it orange for Halloween or red for Christmas or Valentine Day or I use chocolate frosting. I dip them in coconut or finely chopped nuts after I frost them, you can also dip them in sprinkles for Christmas. If you want to make maple bars , just use maple flavoring in the frosting and they taste just like the maple bars you buy in the bakery.

Melt butter in a sauce pan, and add onions and saute until transparent. Add flour to make a roux and cook for about 3 or 4 minutes. Add the milk and stir until hot. Remove about a cup of the milk and set aside. Add the cheeses to the saucepan and continue stirring untill the cheese has melted. Add the spices. Gradually add the eggs to the cooled reserved milk and beat until the eggs are incorporated. Stirring continuously, add the eggs to the saucepan a little at a time. Continue stirring and cook until the sauce begins to thicken. Pour the cheese sauce over the vermicelli and sprinkle withe the breadcrumbs. Bake for 30 minutes or until brown on top. For a really neat looking dish, do a crust of breadcrumbs by layering the bottom and sides of the baking dish with beaten egg followed by a layer of breadcrumbs. Repeat several times. Then bake and unmold onto a serving plate. Recipe By : George McTyre &lt;MCTYREG@baylor.edu&gt; From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <category>Vegetable</category>
    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 (5-7 lb) pumpkin</li>
      <li>6 Whole eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups Whipping cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Molasses</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Fresh grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Ginger</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This dish was a favorite of George Washington. While it was called a pie in the old days, it's certainly not what we call a pie now. Here the custard pie is found inside the pumpkin and the whole thing is to be served up with a bit of anticipation for a very different pumpkin dessert. Cut the lid off the pumpkin just as you would for a jack-o'-lantern. Remove the seeds and save for toasting later. Mix the remaining ingredients together with the exception of the butter. Fill the pumpkin with this mixture and top with the butter. Cover with the pumpkin lid and place in a baking pan. Bake at 350ø for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, or until the mixture has set like a custard. Serve from the pumpkin at your table, scraping some of the meat from the pumpkin with each serving. This is an interesting substitution for the usual pumpkin pie.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Stephen Ceideburg</li>
      <li>9 pounds To 13 lb turkey</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chopped parsley</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chopped fresh sage, or:</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dried sage, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Chopped fresh rosemary, or:</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dried rosemary, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Chopped fresh thyme, or:</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dried thyme, crushed</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Cracked black pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Use indirect heat, as explained in the recipe to cook a whole turkey or turkey breast. Allow 1 3/4 to 3 1/4 hours' cook- ing time, depending on the size of your turkey and heat of the coals. Prepare coals and grill. Remove neck and giblets from turkey. Rinse turkey under cold water; drain and pat dry with paper towels. Combine oil, herbs and seasonings in a small bowl. Generously brush on cavities and outer surface of turkey, reserv- ing some mixture to use as a baste. Pull turkey skin over the neck; secure with a skewer. Tuck wings under back and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Arrange medium-hot briquettes on two sides of a large metal or foil drip pan. Fill the pan halfway with hot tap water. Place turkey, breast side up, on grill, directly above the drip pan. Cover grill and cook turkey 11 to 15 minutes per pound, or until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 180 degrees F, basting occasionally with reserved herb mixture. Add a few briquettes to both sides of the fire every hour or as necessary to maintain a constant temperature. Garnish with additional fresh herbs, if desired.

    <title>Barbecued Turkey with Maple-Mustard Glaze</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR TURKEY</li>
      <li>6 quarts Water</li>
      <li>2 large Onions; quartered</li>
      <li>1 cup Coarse salt</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped fresh ginger</li>
      <li>3/4 cups (packed) golden brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 large Bay leaves</li>
      <li>4 Whole star anise</li>
      <li>12 Whole black peppercorns; crushed</li>
      <li>1 13-to-14-pound turkey; giblets discarded</li>
      <li>4 cups Hickory smoke chips; soaked in water 30 minutes, drained</li>
      <li>Disposable 9x6 1/4x1-inch aluminum broiler pans</li>
      <li>2 large Oranges; cut into wedges</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Oriental sesame oil</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: FOR GLAZE</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Pure maple syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry white wine</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>First the turkey is soaked overnight in a brine to improve flavor and ensure moist meat. (Be sure to use a pot large enough to hold both the brine and the turkey.) The smokiness of the turkey is offset beautifully by the tangy, sweet glaze, which incorporates two quintessential Napa Valley ingredients: wine and mustard. Make turkey: Combine first 8 ingredients in very large pot. Bring mixture to simmer, stirring until salt and sugar dissolve. Cool brine completely. Rinse turkey inside and out. Place turkey in brine, pressing to submerge. Chill overnight, turning turkey twice. If using charcoal barbecue: Mound charcoal briquettes in barbecue and burn until light gray. Using tongs, carefully divide hot briquettes into 2 piles, 1 pile at each side of barbecue. Sprinkle each pile with generous 1/2 cup hickory chips. Place empty broiler pan between piles. Position grill at least 6 inches above briquettes. Position vents on barbecue so that chips smoke and briquettes burn but do not flame. If using gas or electric barbecue: Preheat barbecue with all burners on high. Turn off center burner and lower outside burners to medium-low heat. Place generous 1/2 cup hickory chips in each of 2 broiler pans. Set pans over 2 lit burners. Place empty broiler pan over unlit burner. Position grill at least 6 inches above burners. Remove turkey from brine; discard brine. Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Place orange wedges in main cavity. Mix olive oil and sesame oil in small bowl. Brush over turkey. Arrange breast side up on grill, centering above empty broiler pan. Cover; cook until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 160°F, adding 1 cup hickory chips (and 6 briquettes if using charcoal barbecue) to barbecue every 30 minutes, about 3 hours. For glaze: Bring all ingredients to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Brush glaze over turkey; cover and cook until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 180°F, covering any dark areas of turkey with foil, about 1 hour longer. Transfer turkey to platter. Tent with foil and let stand 30 minutes. Serves 8. Bon Appétit November 1997 Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy &lt;sandysno@pctech.net&gt; on Mar 05, 1998</li>

In 1965, he (along with Arthur Whitman) published "Walter Jetton's LBJ Barbecue Cook Book." I have mentioned it a couple of times in posts, and, since the book is long out of print, I got several requests to post some of the recipes. Here are some of my favorites, along with Jetton's comments and instructions... This is the secret of the ages I am giving you here, and I would not be surprised if wars have been fought over less. Use this as a plate or table sauce with beef, chicken, pork or almost anything else. Don't cook things in it. (about 2 1/2 cups) Combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil. Simmer about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain. (note - the celery pieces that you strain out from the sauce are among the most delicious things I have ever tasted - really wonderful. In fact, I sometimes made the sauce just to have some of the yummy celery. - Bruce) bbq-digest V2 #058 From the BBQ recipe list.

      <li>My favorite meatloaf recipe. Combine the beef, bread crumbs, onion, 8 oz tomato sauce, egg, My Seasoning, and green pepper. Mix well and place in a loaf pan. Combine all sauce ingredients. Cook in a saucepan until butter melts. Pour sauce over meat loaf and bake at 350F^. for 1 hour. While baking, the sauce needs to be spooned over the meat occasionally. Note: Make sure you use a pan large enough for the meat and sauce, or the sauce will tend to boil over while it is cooking. My Seasoning: Mix 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part black pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.

      <li>From: tony.lima@toadhall.com (Tony Lima) Date: Sun, 04 Aug 1996 11:54:00 -0700 (makes about 2-1/2 quarts) by Reed Hearon posted by Tony Lima (tony.lima@toadhall.com) 1. In a large sauce pot render the bacon on low to medium heat until it is lightly browned all over. Add the bacon fat or drippings and onions (see notes) and continue cooking until the onions begin to brown. Add in the garlic, pepper, clove, allspice and coriander and cook for one minute. Add the brown sugar and molasses and simmer for one hour (see notes). 2. Add the vinegar, chipotles and ham hocks, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the volume is reduced by half. 3. Add the ketchup and Worcestershire and slowly simmer for 3 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally (see notes). Strain. Note (added by Tony from notes taken while watching Reed make this sauce): 1. Drippings from a smoked brisket can (should?) be used in place of or in addition to the bacon fat. 2. Use white onions if possible instead of yellow onions. 3. Use a vinegar that will complement whatever beverage you're serving: malt vinegar with beer, wine vinegar with wine, cider vinegar with hard cider, and so on. 4. Have the butcher split the bones. They should be added to the bacon while rendering. Reed also added the garlic cloves to the bacon while rendering to roast the garlic. 5. Simmering the sauce in step 1 is done to kill the sweetness. 6. Simmering times in step 3 are a minimum; overnight is better. 7. "Barbecue" is Reed's spelling, not mine! Copyright, 1996, Reed Hearon.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Note: All measurements are approximate. Add enough of each ingredient to make the sauce "look right." Melt the butter in a large saucepan or in the microwave using a large glass bowl or jar (such as a pickle or mayo jar). Add in about an equal amount of worchestshire sauce. Mix well. Add enough catsup to thicken the sauce; mix vigorously. Add the rest of the ingredients, tasting often. Add additional spice. The sauce should taste fairly pungent, as it will mellow in flavor during barbequing. Good combinations: a. hamburgers--maple syrup and cinnamon b. chicken--lemon juice, honey, oregano or thyme, garlic c. ribs--molasses, orange juice, herbs This sauce can be used before, during, and after barbequing.

      <li>Light a grill, preferably charcoal. Rub the chicken with the oil and season with the thyme, red pepper, salt and black pepper. When the fire is medium hot, arrange the chicken, skin side down, on the grill. Cover and cook, rotating from time to time, so the fat is rendered, about 10 minutes. Turn the chicken, cover and continue cooking until almost cooked through, about 15 minutes longer. Uncover and generously spoon the True Texas Barbecue Sauce all over the skin. Turn the chicken skin side down and grill, basting and turning so it doesn't burn, until the pieces are nicely glazed and slightly charred, about 10 minutes. Serve hot off the grill.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>I've prepared a whole turkey on both a gas grill and a Weber charcoal grill. The largest turkey I've been able to prepare is about 14 lbs. General instructions: Clean turkey well, removing any bits of pin feathers and cleaning the cavity of any remaining pieces of innards. Soften a stick of butter to room temperature and rub the cavity with half of the stick of butter. Stuff with your favorite stuffing. With the remaining butter, stuff a little between the skin and the breast meat and rub some over the skin of the turkey. Stuff a little bit of the stuffing between the skin and the breast also. Skewer the cavity opening shut. Also place a little stuffing in the neck cavity, tuck the neck skin under and skewer shut. Salt and pepper the turkey and I like to place about three pieces of bacon on top of the bird. I know, I know - this is not exactly the most low cholesterol way of preparing turkey--but none of us have a problem here and we've been eating this way for many, many years. I've found that instead of using a roasting pan it is easier to use a homemade pan from extra heavy duty foil - using three layers of foil and making it just big enough to hold the bird and the sides need to be about 2 1/2" high. For a gas grill, I have placed the turkey crosswise on the grill so that the pan is evenly distributed over the two sets of jets. Set the flame so that a temperature of 300 to 325 degrees is maintained. On my 44,000btu grill, that is about the lowest setting. Cover with heavy duty foil for the majority of the cooking. Time about 20 minutes per pound at 300 degrees. Remove the foil for the last hour of cooking. Every once in while, baste the turkey with the juices (or with the basting juice recipe--to follow). I have "hot spots" in the jets of the grill--so about twice during the cooking I turn the turkey around (and the pan, of course) so that one side is not more cooked than another. Basting Juice: Melt the butter in a heavy pot over medium high heat. Chop the onion and saute in the butter until just translucent. Add the neck and the gizzard and continue cooking for about 4 minutes. Add the rosemary and stock and simmer until reduced by half. Strain well. Use the gizzard and neck in the stuffing or the gravy. For the basting juice, mix together the stock preparation, one half of the marsala and vermouth and the juice of one lemon. Use the remaining wine and vermouth and lemon juice if needed. I use all of the mixture for a 20 lbs turkey, so I wouldn't think you would need to use all of it for a smaller turkey. This really keeps the turkey moist and flavorful. BTW, roasting a turkey on the grill - even if you don't use this basing juice - makes a very, very flavorful and juicy turkey (and whole chicken too).

      <li>Date: Tue, 07 May 1996 08:09:08 -0700 From: cstarz@teleport.com (Carey Starzinger) Here is a recipe for 'newbies'. It is almost impossible to foul up. Works everytime on just about anything. This recipe calls for steak, but it will work equally well for poultry, pork, lamb, hamburgers, and last but not least Western Diamondback Rattlesnake. Will work with gas, briquettes, hobo-ques, coal, charcoal on any type of grill from a hibachi, Ghengis Kahn cooker, to a Brinkmann Professional. Can be made up in bulk, using hundreds of steaks or for just a quiet bbq for two. Yes, it has been tested very thoroughly and believe me if you are looking for success in bbq'in this is the one. Enjoy!! 1. Pound steak on both sides with a wooden mallet or the edge of a heavy plate. 2. Combine lemon juice and mustard and spread over both sides of steak. Allow to stand 4-5 hours at room temperature. 3. Broil steaks about 4 inches above glowing coals on barbecue grill for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until desired degree of doneness is achieved. You won't taste the lemon juice or mustard as such - just a very good and flavorful steak.

      <li>4 Cornish game hens (14 ounces each)</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 Shallots, or 3 green onions, white part only</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>

      <li>This aromatic barbecued game hen can be easily served West- ern style with rice, cole slaw or a green salad. [But it would be better with Thai cucumber salad or Vietnamese carrot salad. Mmmm... S.C.] Halve the hens through the breast. Flatten with the palm of your hand. In a mortar or food processor, pound or mince garlic, shallots and sugar. Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Pour mixture over hens; marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight in refrigerator. Set hens, skin-side down, on grill and barbecue over medium coals for 15 minutes. Turn and barbecue 15 minutes longer or until they are thoroughly cooked. Serve with Nuoc Cham dipping sauce.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>These ribs are cooked very slowly for 6 to 8 hours and then if desired "finished" on the BBQ. I have tried shortcutting the recipe and boiling the ribs. Both times my family complained about the ribs being "fatty". Put ribs in oven and cook slowly (250 degrees) until they brown and start to dry out. This should take 2 to 3 hours. Pour off the accumulated fat and bursh on both sides with the sauce. Continue cooking another 4 to 6 hours, brushing on more sauce from time to time. If the ribs start to dry out too much turn down the heat and/or cover with foil. If the sauce starts to burn on the bottom of the pan the oven is too hot. When done they are very tender. They are excellent straight from the oven and even better heated or reheated on the BBQ. This recipe also works with chicken but cut the cooking time in half. The whole idea is to cook the ribs slowly enough to make them moist and tender and not to leave a burned mass of sauce in the bottom of the pan which is really difficult to clean.

      <li>Barbecue sauce (optional)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>SERVES 6-7 This is one ofthe great dishes of our culture. Yes, barbecued pork ribs are very special, and they are ours. Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and Houston seem to have the best ribs imaginable, though every major city in America now boasts a few fine ribs houses. Home cooking of ribs is not difficult at all. There are several methods. I have heard of people steaming the ribs before barbecuing in order to ensure tenderness . . . but I think there is something heretical about that. Something to do with one's grandmother or the Texas sky. I'm not sure why that steaming suggestion so bothers me. It might just work, but I am not about to waste a good slab of ribs trying to find out. I have smoked ribs in a garbage-can smoker and then finished them off in the kitchen oven. I discussed that in an earlier book. That works well, but anyone in Kansas City or Dallas would not hear of such a thing. The old method seems to be the best. Cool fire, slow cooking, sauce on at the end. That is what I want you to try. At Arthur Bryant's, in Kansas City, the meat is done over a very low fire and offered with the sauce on the side. Their sauce is a bit unusual and I have tried to come close to what they offer. My sauce follows. You must go to Bryant's sometime. Calvin Trillin loves the place and has made it quite famous, although you will be surprised when you walk in. It is simply good barbecue served in a black barbecue house. Paper plates, Formica tabletops, the whole scene. Salt and pepper the ribs and cook them over a low fire, just as in the pork-shoulder recipe. They should take about 1-1/2 hours to cook. Be sure that you do not put the ribs on top of one another. Give them plenty of room. Control the smoke flavor by the use of the dampened wood chips or sawdust. Normally the sauce is put on after the ribs are cooked. However, if you like crunchy ribs, baste the ribs when they are finished. Then continue to cook for 15 more minutes. They wouldn't do that in Kansas City, and Edith wouldn't do it in Chicago . . . but sometimes the crunchiness gained from the darkened sugar in the sauce is just great. Don't tell anyone in Kansas City that I told you to do this! From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;. Downloaded from Glen's MM Recipe Archive, http://www.erols.com/hosey.</li>

    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 pounds Squid, cut into rings</li>
      <li>1 cup Coconut milk</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Fish sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Peanuts, finely chopped</li>
      <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
      <li>Cayenne to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>No country of origin, but I'm betting on Vietnam this time, mainly from the dip. Coconut milk is easily made if you have a blender or food processor. Boil 1 1/2 cups water. Pour it over 1 1/2 cups of fresh or dry grated coconut. Beat it in the food processor or blender for at least 1 minute. Strain it through a sieve or through cheesecloth. Marinate the squid for 1 hour in coconut milk to which you have added the garlic. Prepare the coals and skewer the squid. To make the dipping sauce which makes this dish so distinctive, combine the fish sauce, peanuts, sugar, lime juice and the cayenne. Grill the squid for about 3 minutes on one side. When brown, turn over and barbecue 3 minutes more. Serve accompanied by the dipping sauce. This recipe will produce tasty grilled fish if you use firm varieties such as swordfish, sea bass or halibut, cutting the steaks or fillets into large squares. This dish serves 4 to 6 as part of a larger meal.

    <recipetext>
      <li>PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 250F. Salt and pepper the pork ribs evenly and place in a baking dish and cook for 2 hours to render the fat and tenderize the meat. Remove the ribs from the dish, drain the fat and set aside. Heat a wok or large frying pan and add the oil. Quickly add the shallots, scallions, ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for 20 seconds and add the rest of the sauce ingredients. Reduce the heat and simmer the sauce gently for 15 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool. (These steps can be done hours ahead or even the night before.) When you are ready to cook the ribs, smear them with the barbecue sauce. Make a charcoal fire and, when the coals are ash white, grill the ribs, basting with any remaining sauce. Cook the ribs for 5-to-10 minutes on each side, depending on thickness. Serve immediately.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 pounds Squid, cut into rings</li>
      <li>Lemon-garlic butter [posted in another post. S.C.]</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Serve this with a Thai sweet/hot chili sauce. Had it like that in Bangkok and it was one of the best meals I had there. This recipe sounds too easy to be true. It isn't. As with any grilled seafood, the fresher the ingredients and the simpler the cooking, the better the end result. Barbecued squid and an anise flavored aperitif like Pernod, ricard, ouzo or raki, make a wonderful combination. Make a fire, preferably with firewood or Mexican charcoal, started from paper and kindling. Skewer the squid. When coals are red hot, barbecue the rings for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until they are brown. Some recipes for grilled squid suggest marinating them. I omit this procedure because it adds flavor at the expense of softening the flesh. Serve hot with lemon-garlic butter. NOTE: Commercial charcoal and lighter fluid are petroleum products. They impart an oily flavor to food. Hardwood, or Mexican charcoal, a commercial product, which is made by burning down mesquite, both give a nice flavor and are certainly less toxic than petrochemicals. Mexican charcoal is available in Northern California through Lazzari Fuel Company, San Francisco.

    <title>Barbecued Spareribs #4</title>
    <category>Meat</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>See instructions</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Spareribs can be cooked in many ways: stir-fried, deep-fried, steamed, braised, simmered or barbecued. With the exception of the latter, the ribs are always chopped witll a cleaver into bite-size pieces (to make them maneuverable with chopsticks). For barbecuing, the rib rack is usually left intact and, after roasting, the ribs are cut apart and eaten by hand, Or then chopped into bite-size pieces. Regardless of cooking method, the lean meat on the ribs can be left as is or trimmed off for later use in shredded or minced pork dishes. An average rib rack weighs 2-1/2 to 3 pounds. In Western-style meals (which feature one main dish), about 3/4 to 1 pound is generally allowed per person. In Chinese meals, which have many "main" dishes, 1 pound of spareribs will serve 3 or 4 people. As a rule, the rib racks with shorter bones (from smaller pigs) are preferred because they're more tender. TO PREPARE: Leave the rib rack whole or cut in two. Trim off fat and gristle. With a sharp knife, cut between each rib but not clear through. (This will enable the marinade to penetrate the meat.) TO MARINATE: Prepare any of the marinades for barbecued spareribs (see recipes below). Rub marinade over the ribs and into the cuts as well. Place ribs in a shallow pan and pour the marinade over them. Let stand 2 to 4 hours, basting and turning meat from time to time. (Do not marinate for a longer period: the meat will toughen.) Drain, reserving marinade. NOTE: Some cooks rub the ribs with salt and sugar, then let the meat stand one hour before adding the marinade. TO ROAST THE RIB RACK: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place the marinated ribs on a metal rack over a roasting pan nearly filled with water (this will catch the drippings and keep them from burning). Or suspend the ribs high in the oven over the drip pan, barbecue-style (see page 821). Roast about 45 minutes, basting frequently with the reserved marinade. If ribs are roasted flat on a rack, they should be turned at 15 to 20 minute intervals for even browning. (If they are suspended vertically, barbecue-style, this isn't necessary.) Halfway through cooking, the ribs may be glazed with a thin layer of either peanut oil or honey, ora mixture of 2 tablespoons honey and 1 teaspoon soy sauce. NOTE: Spareribs need slow, even roasting over moderate heat. High heat tends to shrivel them. The heat may be turned up to 450 degrees during the last 5 minutes of roasting, however, to crisp the ribs. TO ROAST INDIVIDUAL RIBS: Cut through the meat to separate ribs completely. Marinate and drain as above. Then rub each rib lightly with peanut oil. Preheat oven to 325 degrees and place ribs on a rack over a water-filled drip pan. Roast 30 minutes. Brush with reserved marinade. Roast 5 minutes more. Turn ribs over and repeat process. TO ROAST RIB SEGMENTS: Cut the ribs apart; then with a cleaver chop each rib, bone and all, in 2-inch sections. Marinate and drain as above. preheat oven to 325 degrees. Roast in a pan 35 to 45 minutes, basting frequently with marinade. NOTE: This method shortens roasting time and produces very crisp ribs. TO BARBECUE OVER CHARCOAL: To barbecue spareribs on charcoal grills, prepare as above, but increase the amount of marinade and baste more frequently to keep ribs from drying out. NOTE: Some cooks find it easier to barbecue spareribs partially for 50 minutes in the home oven; then to complete the cooking later, out-of-doors over charcoal. After pre-cooking, let the ribs cool, then cut in 2-rib sections, wrap in foil, and refrigerate. When ready to use the ribs, unwrap and cook them over charcoal until they're reheated and browned (about 10 minutes on each side). TO BROIL: Since spareribs require slow, even cooking, broiling is not recommended. It invariably results in half-cooked or charred ribs. The ribs may be cooked, however, by other methods (steaming, simmering or roasting) until nearly done, and broiled just before serving, until crisp and g0lden (2 to 3 minutes on each side). TO KEEP WARM : Keep barbecued ribs in a slow (200 degree) oven until ready to serve. TO PREPARE IN ADVANCE: Roast marinated ribs as above. Let cool. Wrap in foil and refrigerate. (These will keep several days.) Before serving, reheat the still-wrapped ribs 10 to 15 minutes in a 350-degree oven. TO FREEZE: Roast marinated ribs as above. Let cool. Seal tightly in foil and freeze. When ready to use, reheat the still-wrapped ribs 30 minutes in a 400-degree oven. Do not thaw first. MARINADES: See recipe for one of the following "Marinades for Barbecued Spareribs": Basic, Stock-Soy, Pineapple-Soy, Soy- Sugar, Brown Sugar, Five Spices, Red Bean Cheese, Catsup-Hoisin or Hoisin-Soy.

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Thyme</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>14 ounces Chicken broth (more or less won't hurt)</li>
      <li>4 cups Oysters, drained; reserve liquid (less, to taste)</li>
      <li>14 ounces Artichoke hearts, cooked</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Tabasco</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Whipping cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Parsley (chopped, fresh)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a 3-quart casserole, melt butter and saute shallots. When shallots are translucent, add thyme, bay leaf and cayenne pepper. Add flour and whisk well. Add broth, oyster water, artichoke hearts, salt and tabasco. Bring to a boil. Add oysters and parsley. Simmer on medium, partly covered, for exactly 5 minutes. Add whipped cream and serve immediately. NOTES: * Chicken broth with artichokes and poached oysters ~- This is a modern cajun-style recipe that I adapted from a local convenience-food cookbook by Jean Durkee. It's an intriguing combination of modern American ingredients with traditional cajun flavorings. * Fresh parsley tastes much better than dried parsley. If the oysters are bigger than a small bite-size, cut them up before adding them to the soup. Use the smallest oysters you can find. * When I'm not making a double recipe, I usually dump the entire (about 1-cup) container of whipping cream into the soup, even though that's double what the recipe calls form. * The timing on cooking the oysters is fairly critical. If you overcook them, they will be rubbery. : Difficulty: easy. : Time: 20 minutes. : Precision: measure the spices. : Deborah Pedersen : Microelectronics Computer Corporation, Austin TX : pedersen@mcchi2.ARPA : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes Yield: 4 servings &gt;From Abby Mandel. Special to the Tribune. (Copyright) 1997, Abby Mandel. Poached fish, whether whole (wrapped in cheesecloth to help transfer it from pan) or fillets, can be served hot or chilled. To serve this salmon hot, poach it until just cooked as desired. To serve chilled, stop poaching before it's cooked completely; the salmon will cool down in the liquid, which cooks it further. 1. For poaching liquid, put ingredients in non-aluminum, 10-inch saute pan. Heat to boil over high heat; simmer over medium heat, uncovered, 10 minutes. 2. For salmon, place single layer of fillets in poaching liquid. Place a piece of parchment paper or foil directly over salmon. Simmer until cooked as desired, about 3 to 6 minutes, depending on thickness of fish. If serving hot, use spatula to transfer fish from liquid to warm serving dishes. If serving chilled, let fish cool in liquid. When cool, use spatula to transfer to storage container. Strain poaching liquid and pour about 1/2 cup over salmon to keep it moist. Store remaining poaching liquid in refrigerator up to 3 days or freezer as long as 3 months to use again for fish and/or shellfish, adding liquid and more ingredients as needed. 3. To serve hot, spoon warm salsa on salmon. To serve cold, let salsa chill in refrigerator. Remove poaching liquid from around chilled salmon. Top salmon with chilled salsa.

Melt 1 tabl. of margarine in a 12-inch frying pan over medium high heat; scrape onions from meat and add steaks to pan. Cook until meat is browned on both sides, 10-12 minutes then lift out and set aside. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of margarine to pan on medium high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of margarine to pan on medium high heat. Add onion marinade, bell peppers, and garlic. Cook stirring occasionally until onions are soft about 10 minutes. Return pork to pan. Add taco sauce and wine. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer until pork is very tender when pierced, 1 to 1-1/4 hours. Lift out pork and place on a platter; keep warm. On high heat, boil pan mixture, stirring until most of liquid has evaporated, 8-10 min. Pour over pork and garnish with cilantro. Serve with tortillas; add salt and pepper to taste.

      <li>Place all ingredients in pan of bread machine in order listed, or in the order recommended for your machine. Set controls for Basic bread with medium crust and start machine. Makes one 1 1/2-pound loaf. I created this bread in response to a recent request on this list, and also because I wanted to make a cheese bread using some of the excellent Asiago cheese that we sell at our food co-op. This bread has an *absolutely wonderful* aroma while it's baking. I've made it twice and it has already become my husband's new all-time favorite bread. It's definitely worth the extra effort to use freshly grated cheeses. The cornmeal adds some body and helps make a crisper crust, but if you can't eat corn, leave it out and add more flour (start with 1/4 cup flour and add more if needed). &gt;From: bbriscoe@infolink.morris.mn.us (Bonnie Briscoe) From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe Recipe By : Bonnie Briscoe</li>

      <li>Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon into a medium bowl of cold water. Break off stem of 1 artichoke and largest leaves at bottom. Put artichoke on its side on board. Holding a very sharp knife or small serrated knife against side of artichoke (parallel to leaves), cut lower circle of leaves off, up to edge of artichoke heart; turn artichoke slightly after each cut. Rub cut edges of artichoke with cut lemon. Cut off leaves under base. Trim base, removing all dark green areas. Rub again with lemon. Cut off central cone of leaves just above heart. Put artichoke in bowl of lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Keep artichokes in lemon water until ready to cook them. To cook artichoke bottoms, squeeze any juice remaining in lemon into a medium saucepan of boiling salted water. Add artichoke pieces. Cover and simmer over low heat until tender when pierced with knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool to lukewarm in liquid. Using a teaspoon, scoop out hairlike Choke from center of each artichoke. Alternative: trim then pull each leaf; scrap to remove the choke.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Sat, 02 Mar 1996 07:46:00 GMT From: gemini@synapse.net (Georgette &amp; Dave Burnside) Heat oil in large pot. Add leeks and onion; cook over moderately low heat, stirring often, until softened - about 10 min. Sprinkle with fennel and stir 30 seconds. Add potatoes, broth, and water. Simmer 25 min, until soft. Add arugula and cook about 10 min longer, or until stems are soft. Add salt, pepper and liquor to taste. Puree to rough or smooth texture, as you like. Adjust seasoning. Serve hot or chilled, topped with yogurt and garnished with arugula slivers. As watercress changes potato soup into something that doesn't taste quite like any of the individual ingredients, so arugula transforms this traditional soup base. Flexible, the soup can be pureed to a chunky or a smooth texture, and served hot, as a main dish, or chilled, as a first course.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Re the request for a black-eyed pea recipe, this one was in the Los Angeles Times holiday section today. I haven't tried it, but it sounded good. It doesn't have any meat, but it does have fish. For this reason, it might be more "non-bean-eater friendly." Soak black-eyed peas in water to cover overnight. Drain. Add water to cover, bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. Drain and reserve cooking liquid. Set aside. Pour oil in large pot. Add onion, cayenne, curry powder, seasoned salt and salt to taste and cook over medium-high heat until onion begins to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomato slices and cook 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste. Stir in 1/2 cup water and simmer 5 minutes. Add salmon, including juice, and break into bite-size pieces with back of wooden spoon. Simmer 3 minutes. Add black-eyed peas and reserved cooking liquid and water if necessary to make 4 to 5 cups. Simmer 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook 20 minutes. Add more reserved cooking water if needed to keep stew moist but not soupy. Season with salt to taste. Serve over rice. 8 servings.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine chicken wings, water, onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, parsley and dill sprigs, and pinch of salt to a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Partly cover and simmer 2 hours, skimming occasionally. Skim off excess fat. (Chicken soup can be kept 3 days in refrigerator or can be frozen; reheat before serving.) Make matzo balls: In a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs with oil. Add matzo meal, salt and stir until smooth. Stir in water, then let mixture stand for 20 minutes so matzo meal absorbs liquid. Bring salted water to a boil. With wet hands, roll about 1 teaspoon of matzo ball mixture between your palms into a ball; mixture will be very soft. Set balls on a plate. With a rubber spatula, carefully slide balls into boiling water. Cover and simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes or until firm. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve. (Matzo balls can be kept 2 days in their cooking liquid in a covered container in refrigerator; reheat gently in cooking liquid or in soup.) To serve soup, remove chicken wings, onion, celery, parsnip, parsley and dill sprigs. Take meat off bones and add to soup; or reserve for other uses. Add pepper to soup, stir in snipped dill and taste soup for seasoning. Slice carrot and add a few slices to each bowl. With a slotted spoon, add a few matzo balls. Serve hot.

      <li>by Prevention Magazine, http://www.healthyideas.com A good dish for a large crowd. Just add a simple tossed salad and some crusty garlic bread for a quick party meal. Don't use a metal pan for this dish because the artichokes will become discolored from it. You may assemble the lasagna ahead of time and bake it later. Cover it well and refrigerate for up to one day or freeze for up to a month. We cut the fat and calories in this recipe by: * eliminating the 2 cups of butter * replacing 2 cups of olive oil with 2 teaspoons * reducing the Parmesan cheese from 3 cups to 1 1/2 tablespoons Before After Calories 534 235 Fat (g.) 36.2 3.3 % Calories from Fat 60% 10% Cholesterol (mg.) 79 3 In a large pot of boiling water, cook the noodles for 10 to 12 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onions and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the stock and basil; bring to a boil. Add the artichokes, spinach and peppers; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until all the liquid has evaporated. Set aside. In a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, melt the margarine. Whisk in the flour; cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the milk, Parmesan and nutmeg; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the sauce boils and thickens. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 9-by-13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with nonstick spray. To assemble the lasagna, spread 1/3 cup of the sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 3 of the noodles; spread with half of the artichoke mixture. Spoon 1/3 cup of the sauce over the artichoke mixture and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the bread crumbs. Repeat the procedure.

      <li>Date: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 11:46:35 -0800 From: Gerald Edgerton &lt;jerrye@wizard.com&gt; I don't know if you would classify this as a brunch item, but it is very good. We got it out of Food and Wine or the Gourmet magazine around 20 years ago. To prepare artichokes, remove the stems, cut 1/2" off of top and snip off sharp tips of leaves and cook. Don't over cook. Remove chokes of artichoke by carefully spreading leaves and pulling out innermost ones and scrape away the fuzzy choke with a spoon. To cook shrimp, bring 1 quart water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoons salt. Add shrimp and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 3 to 5 minutes till shrimp turns pink. Reserve 1/2 cup water shrimp was cooked in, then drain, peel and clean the shrimp. Reserve 18 shrimp for garnish. Place remaining shrimp in blender with reserved liquid, the remaining 5 tablespoons lemon juice, seasonings and 1 cup mayonnaise. Blend until shrimp are broken up, chill in refrigerator, where it will become considerably thicker until ready to fill artichokes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Rinse artichokes. Cut off the tip of each large leaf with a scissors, so you won't be pricked by the sharp tips when you're eating the leaves. Then with a knife, cut off the top inch or so of the artichoke. Cut off stems if you want; you can pare them and cook them in the pot alongside the artichoke. Baby artichokes, of l/2-inch diameter or less, do not need trimming. Cook immediately after trimming to avoid discoloration. Lemon may be used. After trimming artichokes wash your hands well; they tend to give your fingers a bitter taste and will affect the next food you pick up and eat.

Add rice and saute an other two or three minutes. Add artichoke hearts and saute another minute. Add water and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and cook about fifteen minutes. Turn off burner and let sit five more minutes. Fluff with forks. Note: I got the idea for this while flipping through a book called _Trucs_of_ the_Trade_ @a bookstore one day. I don't remember what all the guy called for, but this seemed like the logical accopaniment to the above.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Giant artichokes (to 5)</li>
      <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>3 large Pieces of lemon peel</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Finely diced onion or shallots</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
      <li>3 Sprigs of thyme, or a couple of pinches dried</li>
      <li>1 small Branch of tarragon or</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried</li>
      <li>4 Sprigs of parsley</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Fresh lemon juice or tarragon vinegar to taste</li>
      <li>Chopped chervil or tarragon for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim the artichokes down to their hearts (they can be quartered) ad set them in a bowl of water acidulated with the lemon juice as you work. Use a pan large enough to hold all the artichokes in a single layer. Add water just to cover and add the lemon peel, onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, tarragon, and parsley. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, adding small amounts of water as needed, until the artichokes are tender and just a few tablespoons of liquid remain. Remove the bay leaf, lemon, parsley, and thyme branches. Transfer the artichokes to a food paocessor and puree, adding the remaining pan juices as needed to thin the mixture. If any fibers from the artichokes remain, pass the puree through a food mill. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add a little lemon juice or vinegar to sharpen the flavors (again, do this to taste - the puree may already be fine as it is). Heap into a bowl and garnish with the chopped chervil or tarragon. *Note* Artichokes make a subtle and delicate spread to serve with crackers. The time to make this is whenthe large spring artichokes from California are available and inexpensive. If it's available, garnish the spread with chopped chervil or tarragon.

      <li>1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Combine brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. set aside. 2. Center one chicken breast half on each foil sheet. Pour soy sauce mixture evenly over chicken. Top with vegetables. 3. Wrap and seal to form 4 packets. 4. Bake 18 to 22 minutes on a cookie sheet in the overn. To serve, spoon vegetables and sauce over chicken. I love this recipe. It's similar to an entree some Chinese restaurants serve. Usually referred to as chicken in foil. All of the flavors mingle together to make it delicious. This is a great recipe for freezing if you need individual servings later on. Tip: if you don't have heavy duty foil just double up on the regular stuff.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine yeast and 2 cups warm (110@) water in a large bowl; let stand 5 mins. Stir in sugar, salt and 5 1/2 cups flour til moistened. Spread 1/2 cup flour on a board and scrape dough onto it. Knead dough til very smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 mins; add more flour as required to prevent sticking. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place til almost doubled, about 40 mins. When dough is almost risen, bring 3 quarts water to boiling in a covered 4 to 5 qt pan over high heat. Meanwhile knead dough on a lightly floured board to expel air then divide into 12 equal pieces. To shape bagel, knead each piece into a smooth ball. Holding the ball with both hand, poke you thumbs thru the center to form a hole. With 1 thumb in the hole, work around the bagel to make it smooth and evenly thick. Set bagels on lightly floured 12 x 15" baking sheets; let stand covered with plastic wrap just til they are slightly puffy, about 10 mins. With your hand, gently slip bagels into boiling water, adding 4 at a time to pan. Adjust heat to maintain a gentle boil and turn bagels often til they feel firm but are still slightly spongy, 3 to 5 mins. Chill remaining bagels til ready to use. With a slotted spoon transfer bagels to a towel; drain briefly, then place bagels slightly apart on 2 lightly oiled 12 x 15" baking sheets. In a food processor or with a knife, coarsely chop cheese. Beat egg yolk to blend with 1 tbsp water and brush mixture over bagels. Then pat cheese onto bagels, pressing gently to make cheese stick. Bake bagels in a 375@ oven til browned, 30 to 35 mins.

      <li>Ingredient Group: STEW</li>
      <li>12 small Red-skinned potatoes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Celery seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon (packed) stemmed saffron</li>
      <li>18 Mussels, scrubbed, debearded</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Chopped shallots</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 Green onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 bunch Chives, chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Artichokes: Squeeze juice from 2 lemon halves into a large bowl; add lemon halves. Fill bowl with water. To prepare an artichoke for cooking, first cut off the stem. Starting at the base of the artichoke, bend the tough dark green outer leaves back and snap them off where they break naturally: continue until all of the outer leaves have been removed, leaving a cone of tender pale green leaves. Using a small sharp knife, trim the outside edge of the base of the artichoke until it is smooth. Rub the trimmed edge with 1 of the remaining lemon halves. Cut artichoke lengthwise into quarters. Rub the cut sides of these quarters with lemon to prevent any discoloration. Using the small knife, carefully cut out the hairy choke and the spiky purple-tipped leaves from each artichoke quarter. Rub each cut area with lemon. Trim the tougher leaf tops from each quarter so that all that remains is the choicest, most tender portion of the artichoke. Cut quarter into two wedges. Places wedges into the lemon water. Repeat with the remaining artichokes. Bring the chicken broth, olive oil and bay leaf to a boil in a heavy large pot (do not use aluminum or cast iron). Drain artichokes; add to pot. Return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until artichokes are tender, about 20 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer artichokes to medium bowl. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid in small bowl. Stew: Place potatoes, salt, bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds and celery seeds in large saucepan. Pour in enough cold water to cover potatoes generously. Boil until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Cool 15 minutes; peel. Stir saffron in heavy large pot over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add reserved 1 cup cooking liquid; bring to simmer. Add artichokes, potatoes, mussels, shallots, butter and 3/4 teaspoon mustard seeds. Bring to boil. Cover pot; cook until mussels open and potatoes are golden, about 8 minutes. (Discard any unopened mussels.) Mix in green onions. Season with salt and pepper. Divide stew among 6 shallow soup bowls. Sprinkle with chives and serve.

Add potatoes, broth, and water. Simmer 25 min, until soft. Add arugula and cook about 10 min longer, or until stems are soft. Add salt, pepper and liquor to taste. Puree to rough or smooth texture, as you like. Adjust seasoning. Serve hot or chilled, topped with yogurt and garnished with arugula slivers. As watercress changes potato soup into something that doesn't taste quite like any of the individual ingredients, so arugula transforms this traditional soup base. Flexible, the soup can be pureed to a chunky or a smooth texture, and served hot, as a main dish, or chilled, as a first course.

      <li>One or both of these first two steps is required in all the recipes that follow. Step I: Cleaning Remove any hairs on heads, feet, tails, ears or snouts by singeing over an open flame or plucking. Scrub well (using a vegetable brush if desired) and then sprinkle with salt, rubbing it into the skin. Rinse well with cool water; pat dry. Remove any excess fat. Poultry feet (chicken, duck or turkey) must be stripped of their outer scaly skin; plunge them in boiling water for 1 minute, as you would do before peeling tomatoes. Proceed with recipe. Step II: Parboiling Parboil in salted water (1 teaspoon salt for each quart water) for 5 minutes. Drain, discarding water. This step serves the propose of ridding the meat of running blood as well as clinging meat, fat or bone residue, thereby adding clarity to sauces.

      <li>8 medium Potatoes</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Salt</li>
      <li>2 cups All-Purpose Flour, Up To 2-1/2 Cups</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Puncture potatoes in several places with a fork. Bake 1 hour in a 350F oven or until tender. Remove and discard skins. Mash potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl, and let cool a little. Add egg yolk, salt, and 2 cups flour. Mix well. Knead dough on work surface or board into a ball. It should be soft and a little sticky. If it's too sticky, add a little flour. Lightly flour surface and hands. Break dough into egg-size pieces. Roll until thickness of thumb. Cut roll into 1-inch pieces. Push each Gnocchi against the back of a fork to imprint a pattern. This helps them absorb more sauce (and makes them a little prettier). Arrange them on a floured tray. Fill a large saucepan 2/3 full with salted water. Bring to a boil. Add oil and dumplings. Stir, to make sure they don't stick t bottom. When they come to surface, let them cook 10-12 seconds more. Remove with a slotted spoon as they are done. They get soggy if overcooked (they absorb more moisture than regular pasta). Serve with butter and Parmesan cheese or your favorite sauce.

      <li>Here's a good basic pizza dough recipe from a Julia Child cookbook that coincidentally is perfect in the DAK breadmaker... I sometimes throw in a little cornmeal for a nice effect too. I highly recommend the combination we made last night - a pizza with a thin layer of ricotta cheese, a good amount of mozzerella, a decent sprinkling of smoked salmon (it was really a tiny amount, just a few ounces) and some fresh thyme. Throw it on the pizza stone which has been heating in the oven at 425 (about 10-15 minutes of pre-heating) and then cook for abou;t 10 minutes or until the top has started to brown. &gt;From: ace@tidbits.halcyon.com (Adam C.

    <title>Basic Recipe for Roast Chicken</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Whole chicken; 3 1/2-5 lbs. each (giblets, kidneys,and excess fat removed) (chicken rinsed and dried)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Herbs; (citrus peel or onion or other aromatics)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Butter; melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Adjust oven rack to middle position- heat oven to 500 degrees. Elevate roasting rack by crumpling four sheets of aluminum foil into balls and placing them underneath rack to raise it slightly above edge of pan-, lightly oil roasting rack. 2. Season cavity with salt and pepper to taste- place aromatics in cavity. Pin flaps of skin at leg end together. If legs splay badly, tie drumstick ends loosely together. Arrange chicken, backside up, on rack. 3. Roast chicken, brushing bird with butter or pan juices every 8 to 1 0 minutes. (If pan juices begin to spatter loudly, add a few tablespoons of water to pan" repeat whenever necessary). 4. After 20 minutes (for a small chicken) to 30 minutes (for a chicken approaching 5 pounds), season legs and turn chicken, breast side up, pouring juices from body cavity into pan. Prop up the breast end with 1 - ~inch-thick wad of foil under the back. Baste and return to oven. 5. Roast chicken, basting every 7 to 8 minutes, until breast side has browned sufficiently. Turn down oven to 325 degrees and prop oven door open for a minute or two to quickly bring temperature down. After 40 minutes total cooking time (50 minutes for large birds) season breast and legs, then check inner breast temperature by inserting thermometer from neck-end along ribs. When thermometer registers 148 to 150 degrees (145 degrees if you don't mind some slightly pink spots), the breast is done. Figure on breast temperature rising 2 degrees (larger birds) to 3 degrees (small ones) for every additional minute in oven. When breast is done, insert thermometer into thigh meat closest to body-, it should read at least 160 degrees. 6. When chicken is done, tip cavity juices into pan and poke skin below thigh to release under-skin juices. Transfer chicken with rack to a plate, let rest for at least 20 minutes before serving.

    <title>Basic Pizza Dough</title>
    <category>Pizza</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Warm tap water (110 to 115 degrees)</li>
      <li>1 package Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 To 3 1/2 cups flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Pour the water into a medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved and the liquid turns light beige in color. 2. Add 1 cup of the flour and the salt. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Add a second cup of flour to the bowl and mix well. After the second cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl and should begin to form a soft,sticky mass. 3. Measure out the third cup of flour. Sprinkle some over the work surface and flour your hands generously. Remove all of the dough from the bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the additional flour in a bit at a time. 4. To knead the dough, use the heel of your hands to push the dough across the floured work surface in one sweep. Clench the dough in your fist and twist and fold it over. Use the dough scraper to help gather the wet dough that sticks to the work surface into a ball while kneading. Repeat this action over and over again, adding only as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Work quickly and don't be delicate. Slap and push the dough around to develop its gluten and to facilitate its rolling out. (Kneading pizza dough is a great way to relieve pent-up aggression!) 5. When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds. This will test its readiness;if your hand comes up clean, the dough is done. If it sticks, a bit more kneading will be necessary. Once the dough is no longer sticky, do not overwork it by adding more flour. Continue kneading only until the dough is smooth and elastic (it should spring back when pressed) and no lines of raw white flour show. The whole process should take 5 to 10 minutes. 6. Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil. Roll the ball of dough around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil. Tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap to trap in the moisture and heat from the yeast's carbon dioxide gases. This will help the dough rise faster. 7. Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place. Let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes. 8. Once the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down by pushing your fist into it. All of the gases will quickly escape, and the dough will collapse. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it again for about 1 minute. 9. The dough is now ready to be patted and rolled into pizza, or to undergo additional rising. 10. To raise dough a second time, add a bit more oil to the bowl and repeat the procedure indicated for the first rising. Then the dough is ready to be shaped.

Cover and steam until the rice is done, 18 to 20 minutes. Uncover and allow to dry out, 3 to 5 minutes. Fluff with fork before serving. Variations: * Soak rice in hot water; allow to cool; drain and proceed with recipe. Turkish cooks consider this step necessary for a fluffier rice. * Although not typical, pilaf may be flavored with onion and garlic. * Pilaf may be sprinkled with finely chopped parsley or paprika to taste just before serving. * Like their neighbors in Italy, Greeks love tomatoes so they can sometimes add the flavor to pilaf. Saute 1/2 cup finely chopped onion in oil. Add 1/2 cup finely chopped tomato or tomato sauce to rice and broth in steaming pan. Onion may be omitted.

    <category>Misc</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 cups Unsalted butter well chilled or frozen</li>
      <li>1 large Egg yolk</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Ice water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>CUT THE BUTTER into tablespoon-size pieces. Put in a food processor and chop by pulsing the machine on and off about 6 times. Add the egg yolk, water and salt and process until the ingredients are mixed, about 5 seconds. The butter should still be in little pieces. Add the flour and process just until the ingredients begin to clump together. Stop processing before a ball forms, or even begins to form. Transfer the dough to a large plastic bag. Working through the bag, press the dough into a ball, then flatten into a disc, about 8 inches wide. If you are using the dough right away, it must be chilled enough to firm it before rolling. Place it in the refrigerator or freezer just until it is firm but not hard. The dough can also be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen. If so, let stand at room temperature until softened enough to roll without splitting. 15 minutes before baking, place the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400F. Have ready the pie plate or tart pan you will be using. Roll the dough on a floured board to a circle about 1/8-to-1/16-inch thick. Lift the dough several times and brush the board with flour to keep the dough from sticking. Lightly fold the dough in half, then in quarters. Lift to the pie plate or tart pan and position it with the point in the center. Unfold and ease it into the bottom and sides of the pan. Do not stretch the dough. Leave about 3/4 inch of dough beyond the upper edge of the pan and trim the excess. Fold the overlap so there is a double thickness of dough around the sides. Crimp the edge to make a decorative border. Prick the dough with a fork at random, so steam can escape. Refrigerate or freeze briefly, to firm the dough. For a pre-baked shell, line the pastry with aluminum foil and fill the foil with dried beans or rice to weight the pastry. Place on a baking sheet for easier handling. Bake for 14 minutes. Remove the foil with the beans or rice. (The beans or rice can be used over again as weights.) Prick pastry again, and bake until it is lightly colored, 10 to 14 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack before filling. Sweet Variation: Add 2 tablespoons sugar to the work bowl with the butter. Decrease the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.

    <title>Basic Pizza Dough</title>
    <category>Pizza</category>
    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Warm tap water (110 to 115 degrees)</li>
      <li>1 package Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 To 3 1/2 cups flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Pour the water into a medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved and the liquid turns light beige in color. 2. Add 1 cup of the flour and the salt. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Add a second cup of flour to the bowl and mix well. After the second cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl and should begin to form a soft,sticky mass. 3. Measure out the third cup of flour. Sprinkle some over the work surface and flour your hands generously. Remove all of the dough from the bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the additional flour in a bit at a time. 4. To knead the dough, use the heel of your hands to push the dough across the floured work surface in one sweep. Clench the dough in your fist and twist and fold it over. Use the dough scraper to help gather the wet dough that sticks to the work surface into a ball while kneading. Repeat this action over and over again, adding only as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Work quickly and don't be delicate. Slap and push the dough around to develop its gluten and to facilitate its rolling out. (Kneading pizza dough is a great way to relieve pent-up aggression!) 5. When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds. This will test its readiness;if your hand comes up clean, the dough is done. If it sticks, a bit more kneading will be necessary. Once the dough is no longer sticky, do not overwork it by adding more flour. Continue kneading only until the dough is smooth and elastic (it should spring back when pressed) and no lines of raw white flour show. The whole process should take 5 to 10 minutes. 6. Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil. Roll the ball of dough around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil. Tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap to trap in the moisture and heat from the yeast's carbon dioxide gases. This will help the dough rise faster. 7. Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place. Let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes. 8. Once the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down by pushing your fist into it. All of the gases will quickly escape, and the dough will collapse. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it again for about 1 minute. 9. The dough is now ready to be patted and rolled into pizza, or to undergo additional rising. 10. To raise dough a second time, add a bit more oil to the bowl and repeat the procedure indicated for the first rising. Then the dough is ready to be shaped.

    <recipetext>
      <li>From: jills@vnet.IBM.com Date: 18 Feb 1994 05:18:12 -0500 In answer to the recent request for scones, I dug some up from: Hamlyn All Colour Cakes and Baking cookbook. It is an honest-to-goodness British cookbook. Fruit scones are my favorite, so I'll write the recipe for them first. Because this is a British cookbook, the measurements may look a little different than you're used to. In these recipes, I assume that caster sugar is roughly equivalent to the American granulated sugar. Finally, we have Basic Scones. Preheat oven to 425 F. Sift the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar and enough milk to mix to a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface, knead lightly and roll out to a 3/4-inch thickness. Cut into 2-inch rounds and place on a floured baking sheet. Brush with milk to glaze. Bake for 10 minutes then cool on a wire rack. Serve with butter or cream, and jam. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>to make about 1 1/2 pounds of pasta-(From the Good Cook Pasta book-Time-Life series) Mound 3 cups of flour on smooth work surface-make a well in the center of the mound and break the eggs into the well. Add a big pinch of salt and the olive oil. Slowly mix in the flour with the eggs by using the flour just around the eggs without breaking down the sides of the well until enough flour has been incorporated into the eggs to hold it all together. When all the flour has been incorporated and the dough still feels sticky add more flour, just a little bit at a time. The dough should feel stiff, but malleable. I have also put the ingredients into a food processor and the dough comes out just fine. The dough then can be kneaded by hand briefly before either rolling out by hand or with a pasta machine. Wrap the pasta in plastic wrap and let rest for about an hour. After the pasta has rested roll/cut to desired size/shape and let dry on pasta rack or a broomstick or........until brittle. The pasta can also be cooked directly without being dried. If it is cooked before it is dried it takes very little time to cook- Posted to FOODWINE Digest 29 Nov 96 From: Frank &amp; Penny Coster &lt;penelope@SONIC.NET&gt; Date: Fri, 29 Nov 1996 16:27:16 -0800</li>

    <title>Basic Pate a Choux</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Water or milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter (4 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar if making a sweet pastry</li>
      <li>1 cup Flour</li>
      <li>4 Eggs (1 cup)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place liquid, butter, salt and sugar, if using, in a medium saucepan and bring slowly to a simmer. Turn off heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until it forms a ball. Return to medium heat to dry the paste so it will have the maximum puffing ability: turn the ball around in the pan, pressing it against the sides and flipping it over, until butter starts oozing out and the paste no longer sticks to your fingers. Remove from heat and let cool a bit. Turn the paste into a medium bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle and beat in the eggs, one at a time, with a wooden spoon or the paddle. Each time you add an egg, the mixture will become slippery and messy but will then come together, at which point you can add the next egg. Load mixture into pastry bag with a round tip (1/2 or 1-inch depending on size puff desired) and pipe out as required. It will give the fullest puff if used right away but can be held for several hours. Basic proportions for Pate a Choux are 1:1:1:1/2, or 1 cup liquid, 1 cup flour:1 cup egg:1/2 cup butter. Water makes choux more crisp, milk makes them more tender, Puffs expand when cooked as water in batter turns to steam and explodes the dough. Pate a choux is an extremely versatile pastry that can be the base of many sweet and savory dishes. It can take many forms: be poached as gnocchi, baked to form hollow puffy balls that can be filled with various things, or fried as fritters and sprinkled with sugar. It is neutral in flavor so is adaptable to any cuisine.

      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large Onion; peeled and finelydiced</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry white wine</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Heavy cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>MICHAEL'S PLACE SHOW#ML1A17 Pick through the rice to remove any stones or foreign matter, but do not wash the rice before cooking. Using a large skillet with a heavy bottom, heat the olive oil over low heat and saute or "sweat" the onions until translucent, being careful not to allow them to color or brown at all. Add the arborio rice, stir to coat with the olive oil, and saute with the onions to toast each grain of rice, about 7 minutes. This toasting process adds the chewy, al dente quality that attracts so many people to risotto. Once the rice is lightly toasted, add the white wine slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon. (A wooden spoon is always preferable when making risotto, as a metal spoon tends to cut or injure the grains of rice. Constant stirring should be avoided for the same reason.) Preheat the chicken stock just to the boiling point, then have it ready at stoveside. After the rice has absorbed the white wine and the skillet is nearly dry, add one cup of chicken stock, stirring occasionally, and cook over very low heat until the stock is absorbed by the rice. Continue adding the stock, a cupful at a time, until all the stock has been absorbed. (Adding the liquid in stages, instead of all at once, allows the grains of rice to expand more fully, adding to the risotto's creamy texture.) Once the rice has been added to the pan, the entire cooking process will take about 17 to 20 minutes. After all of the liquid has been added, and the rice is chewy yet fully cooked, with a creamy texture; add the butter, Parmesan cheese, and the heavy cream. Stir to combine all the ingredients and serve immediately. Posted to recipelu-digest by jecraig@lan-inc.com on Feb 16, 98</li>

(Or chop duck, bones and all, in 2-inch sections.) Serve hot, with or without gravy. The gravy may be reserved for later use as a master sauce (see recipe). Or serve cold. NOTE: The duck is done when the meat is so tender it nearly falls from the bones. VARIATIONS: 1. In step 1, use 1/3 stock, 2/3 water. 2. In step 2, add 5 dried black mushrooms (soaked) and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. 3. Use 12 to 15 whole scallions (trim root ends, but keep stalks and green leaves intact). Toss scallions in a mixture of 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon sugar, then place in duck cavity with the ginger root. Bring to a boil as in step 1, then cook with seasonings as in steps 2 and 3. Serve bird whole with gravy. 4. For a smaller duck (3 to 4 pounds) use only 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sherry and 1 teaspoon sugar. Cook 1-1/2 hours, basting and turning for even coloring.

      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Olive oil; preferably extra-virgin</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: chrisgun@microsoft.com (Chris Gunnerson) Date: Fri, 11 Mar 1994 20:59:36 GMT In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar (which "feeds" the yeast) in warm tap water. (Water that is too hot will kill the yeast, while water that is too cold will not activate it.) Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently until it dissolves, about 1 minute. When yeast is mixed with the water at the proper temp., a smooth, beige-colored mixture restults. (If the yeast clumps together and the water stays clear, discard the mixture and start over). Let stand in a warm spot until a thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes, indicating that the yeast is effective. (Discard mixture and start over with a fresh package of yeast if bubbles have not formed within 5 mins). To mix and knead the dough by hand, combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil. Using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. Shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. While kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 cup flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky; this should take about 5 minutes. As you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Knead the dough only until it feels smooth and springy; too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the flour and results in a tough crust. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. (This oiling of the dough prevents a hard surface from forming that would inhibit rising.) Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss, and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75 to 85 degrees F - a hotter environment may kill the yeast) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. With your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to prevent overrising. Shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air bubbles. If you cannot bake pizza within 2 hours after rising, punch the dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. (The dough can be punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable.) Let chilled dough come to room temp. before proceeding.

On a large work surface, form a mound with the semolina and create a "well" in the center of the mound. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and oil together until smooth. Pour this mixture into the well. Working from the inside of the well out, gradually work the semolina into the eggs, until all the flour is worked in. Wrap with plastic and allow to rest for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and temper for 5 minutes. Flour a surface and turn the dough out onto it. Roll out the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Cut the dough out into thirds. Using a pasta machine, wide cutters, carefully work one piece of the pasta dough through the pasta machine. Lightly toss the cut pasta in flour to prevent from sticking. Pass the remaining pieces of pasta through the machine. Bring a pot of salt water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes or until the pasta is tender. Drain and toss the pasta with olive oil, salt and pepper. Serve warm. Yield: 1 pound of pasta/4 servings Posted to recipelu-digest by molony &lt;molony@scsn.net&gt; on Feb 27, 1998</li>

When oil is hot, gradually add flour, stirring constantly until well mixed. Lower flame and continue stirring until chocolate brown. When roux is chocolate brown, removed from pot and set aside. If roux remains in the pot it will continue to cook and get too dark. Always use warm water to dissolve the roux. While you're at it, make more than enough as it keeps well in or out of the refrigerator. P.S. The darker the roux the more intense the taste. I prefer mine the color of peanut butter.

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk (I use about 3/4 c.; usually low-fat buttermilk)</li>
      <li>1 Egg equivalent (Eggbeaters)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>The recipe calls for 1 T. oil, but you can substitute mashed banana, prune puree, applesauce, whatever. I cook these on a non-stick griddle sprayed lightly with Pam Zoe asked for pancake recipes. This is the basic one I've used for many years, from the old New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook (which unfortunately I no longer have). Recently I've begun mixing up the dry ingredients in large quantities, using a mixture of flours. Last time it was something like 3 c. whole wheat flour, 2 c. cornmeal, 1 c. rye flour. Think I'll put in some oatmeal next time. Whatever your mixture, for every cup of flour add 1 tsp. soda, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1 T. sugar. Then when you get ready to make pancakes, for every 1 1/4 c. pancake mix, just add 1 c. buttermilk, 1 egg equivalent, and 1 T. of your fat substitute. It's nice to have on hand. I store mine in big coffee cans, with a bay leaf added to discourage the creepy-crawlies (the bay leaf has always worked for me--knock on wood).

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>FOOD PROCESSOR METHOD: Place the flour in the bowl of the food processor. With the motor running, add the eggs, one at a time. Continue processing for 10 seconds after the last egg has been added. Add drops of water if the dough seems too dry. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 6 to 8 minutes or until the dough is smooth and satiny and springs back when pressed with a finger. HAND MIX METHOD: Place the flour in a mound on a clean work surface. Form a well in the center and break the eggs into the well. Mix the eggs with a fork. Pulling from the sides of the well, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs. Continue to mix until the dough forms a ball, adding drops of water as necessary. Begin kneading the dough, pushing the dough with the heel of your hand. Knead until soft and satiny. Most important, the dough should spring back when poked with your finger. This will take 10 to 15 minutes of continuous kneading. Divide the dough into 4 pieces, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. The dough may also be frozen at this point, thaw in the refrigerator before proceeding. Yield: approximately 1 pound of pasta, serving 4 SPINACH-BASIL PASTA: Roll out by hand or with a hand-cranked pasta machine, according to themanufacturer's directions. In a saucepan of lightly salted boiling water, blanch the spinach and basil 5 seconds. Remove and immediately plunge into ice water to set the color. Drain, pat dry, and then squeeze in a towel to remove any excess liquid. Chop very fine and add as the eggs are incorporated into the flour. Proceed as directed above. CARROT-SAGE PASTA: Add the carrot puree or juice and minced sage to the eggs as they are incorporated into the flour. Proceed as directed above. GREMOLATA PASTAL Add the zest, garlic, and parsley to the eggs as they are incorporated into the flour. Proceed as directed above. SAFFRON-WHITE WINE PASTA: In a small saucepan, combine the wine, water, and saffron. Bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let cool. Add the mixture to the eggs as they are incorporated into the flour mixture. Proceed as directed above. FETTUCCINE WITH FRESH AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES: Cook the pasta in lightly salted boiling water until just al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes if fresh. Drain and immediately run cold water over to stop the cooking. Drain again and toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to prevent the pasta from sticking. Warm the remaining olive oil in a pan, add the shallots and garlic, and saute for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Combine the oil, shallots, and garlic with the remaining ingredients, except the cheese. Season with salt and pepper and toss with the pasta. Serve in bowls, sprinkled with freshly grated cheese, a drizzle of basil oil around, and a basil sprig. continued in part 2</li>

A good, low-fat pizza sauce is a must for the healthy cook. The secret to the flavor of this, which uses very little oil, is steeping the dried basil and oregano in wine before cooking. This simple step draws out the flavor of the herbs -- the sauce tastes as if it had been cooking for hours.

Sift the measured flour twice with the baking powder, salt, and other fine ingredients such as powdered mustard (which you would use if you were making cheese scones). Dice the fats into the dry ingredients, then lightly rub in with cool fingertips or a pastry blender until completely blended. Make a well in the center and stir in the milk. Lightly mix with a fork until the ingredients form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured board and knead very lightly for about 30 seconds to a loose, smooth dough. Roll out with a rolling pin to approximately 3/4 inch thick. Stamp out with a 2-inch cutter or cut into triangles with a sharp knife. Lightly knead together any trimmings and roll and stamp out again. Lift with a spatula onto the HOT baking sheet, placing 1 inch apart. Brush only the tops with lightly beaten egg or milk. Bake toward the top of the oven for approximately 10 minutes, or until well risen and golden brown. Lift onto a wire rack with the spatula to cool. (If you were to make cheese scones, you would add 1 3/4 cups very finely grated mature cheddar cheese, and a pinch of dry English mustard) Clotted cream is a spread somewhat similar to butter, but not the same. I don't know if it is possible to get in the U.S..I seem to recall that I may have seen instructions for making it in one of those "Cheaper and Better" type books. I'll look.

    <category>Import</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Warm water; about 100 degrees</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 cups Unbleached flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Cornmeal for pans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place the water in a small bowl and whisk in yeast. Allow yeast to soften while preparing remaining ingredients. Place flour and salt in work bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade. Pulse 2 or 3 times to mix. Add oil and pulse ten times to mix thoroughly. Add yeast mixture, being careful to scrape all yeast from bowl with a rubber spatula. Pulse again until the dough forms a ball, about ten more times. Let the dough rest in the work bowl for 5 minutes, then run the machine continuously for 10 seconds, for a final mixing of the dough. Remove dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly to form a smooth ball. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn dough to coat all surfaces. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until double in bulk, about an hour. After dough has risen, remove from bowl to lightly floured work surface and knead lightly to deflate. Form dough into a ball and place in oiled bowl, turning dough to coat all surfaces. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for 2 hours (or up to 24 hours) before proceeding. Preheat oven to 325 degrees and set racks in upper and lower thirds. Cover three jelly roll pans with cornmeal, using a tablespoon or so for each pan. Scrape refrigerated dough from bowl to a lightly floured work surface, making sure dough emerges from bowl in one piece and doesn't fold. Press dough into a 9-inch square. Cut dough into 2 rectangles, each 4 1/2 by 9-inches. Then cut each rectangle into 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch lengths, to make 36 pieces in all. Cover the cut pieces of dough with plastic wrap or a towel to keep them from forming a skin. One at a time, roll pieces of dough under palms of hands, stretching at the same time, to make narrow sticks about 15-inches long. If dough resists, set pieces aside under plastic wrap or towel to rest for 5 minutes, and they will roll and stretch easily. As breadsticks are formed, arrange them in length of pan, about 10 or 12 to a pan, keeping them about 1/2-inch apart. Let the breadsticks rest about 10 minutes, then bake the first two pans for about 20 to 30 minutes, until they are firm, crisp and light golden. The third pan may wait while the first ones are baking. Cool the breadsticks on the pans or on racks. Store breadsticks in a paper bag or loosely covered with plastic wrap at room temperature. If they absorb humidity and soften, bake them again for 5 minutes at 325 degrees. Yield: 36 breadsticks NOTES : Recipe courtesy of Nick Malgieri Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9050 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman" &lt;jfreeman@comteck.com&gt; on Feb 7, 1998</li>

      <li>Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the lard and work it in with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, working it in with your hands. Add only as much as you need to make a smooth ball of dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface. For 2 crusts, cut the dough in two and put the second half back in the refrigerator. For each crust, roll the dough out on the floured surface into a circle about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Gently fold the circle of dough in half and then in half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9-inch pie pan. Fill and proceed as directed in the recipe. This recipe yields two 9-inch pie crusts.

    <title>Basic Pita</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>24</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Warm water (90 to 100 degrees F.)</li>
      <li>2 Envelopes active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>5 To 5 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus flour for kneading</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pour the water into a large bowl, sprinkle in the yeast and stir to dissolve. Stir the sugar and salt into the yeast mixture thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Gradually add 5 cups of the flour, stirring constantly until the dough is smooth. Slowly work in the remaining flour with your hands, kneading until the dough is no longer sticky. Turn the dough out onto a well floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Shape the dough into an even rectangle and cut in half, lengthwise. Divide each half into 12 portions for small pitas, 6 for larger ones. Shape each into a smooth ball. Place balls on a floured surface and cover them with a slightly damp towel while you roll out one at a time. Gently press each ball flat with your fingers, keeping it well rounded. Flour a work surface and a rolling pin. Roll each round from the center to the outside edge, giving the dough a 1/4 turn after each roll, to form a perfect circle not quite 1/4-inch thick (5 to 5 1/2 inches in diameter for small pitas; about 8 1/2 inches for larger ones). Carefully flip the circles over to smooth out any creases that might prevent the pockets from forming. Fifteen minutes before the loaves have finished rising, preheat the oven to 500F and place an ungreased baking sheet in the oven to heat. As each bread is rolled, place it carefully on a floured surface and cover with a clean, dry towel; do not let the surfaces dry out, and let rise in a warm, draft-free area for 30 to 45 minutes. To bake, place 4 small pitas or I large one on the hot baking sheet. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until puffed and lightly browned on the bottom, almost white on top, about 4 minutes for small pitas and about 3 1/2 minutes for large; the pita will be soft and flexible. If desired, flip the loaves over after they have puffed and bake for up to 1 minute longer to brown tops; be VERY careful not to let pita get crisp and brittle. Remove hot pitas from oven and wrap immediately in clean, dry towels until cool enough to handle. Serve warm or at room temperature. Repeat baking process until all breads are baked. Makes 24 small or 12 large pitas. From "Pita the Great" From the San Francisco Chronicle, 8/10/88. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; November 10 1992.

    <title>Basic Rice Recipes for Those with Allergies</title>
    <category>Rice</category>
    <category>Gluten-free</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient/>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Over 100,000 people are unable to eat foods from grains such as wheat, barley, rye and oats; others may also react to millet and buckwheat. This condition is known as Celiac Sprue Disease and is basically a problem of malabsorption. The primary treatment calls for the omission of any product that contains certain proteins, namely gluten. Rice, a non-allergenic food, is ideal for the gluten-free diet, and is suitable for most allergy diets. An added bonus is that it's also fat, sodium and cholesterol free. Rice comes in many forms including white and brown rice, flours, rice bran and rice oil. It is also very versatile; rice can be served as a snack at any meal as an appetizer, entree or dessert. If you are following a special allergy diet, remember to read labels carefully. Ingredients often change from one product to another, and even from batch to batch from the same manufacturer. If the label is not clear, you can write or call the manufacturer (look on the label) for specific ingredient information. We hope you find these recipes, and the accompanying information helpful. All of the recipes are wheat-free. For those who are also sensitive to milk and eggs, suggestions for substitutes are given on the following page. When wheat and wheat flours are not used in baking recipes the final product tends to be coarser and denser. Here are some hints for making better foods, and some ingredient substitutions if you are also avoiding milk and eggs. SUGGESTIONS * Include brown rice flour and rice bran in soups, casseroles and baked goods to add more fiber. * Add dried fruits, nuts or chocolate chips to batters to improve flavor and moisture-retaining qualities of baked goods. * Bake gluten-free items in smaller sizes - like cupcakes, muffins, and biscuits; bake quick breads in mini loaf pans for better texture. SUBSTITUTIONS * Thicken sauces, gravies and cream pies with rice flour. Use the same amount of rice flour as wheat flour. Whisk rice flour and liquid together and heat over medium heat until bubbles first appear for a smoother mixture. * Combine dry cream of rice or dry crushed rice cereal with dried herbs and spices to make a tasty breading for fish, meat, or poultry. * Substitute _one_ of the following for each cup of wheat flour in recipes: : 7/8 cup brown or white rice flour (1 cup minus 2 Tbsp.) : 5/8 cup potato flour (1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp.) : 1 cup soy flour + 1/4 cup potato starch : 1 cup corn flour : 1 scant cup fine cornmeal * Use Rice Dream or Amasake, pure rice liquids; or Eden Soy, Lacto-Free, Tofu White (all contain soy); NutQuik (made from almonds) to use in place of milk. Several infant formulas are made from a base of soy or corn, check the labels to be sure they fit your needs. * Replace milk with fruit or vegetable juices; and experiment with yogurt; many people who are allergic to milk are able to tolerate yogurt and other cultured dairy products. * Add EggBeaters (found in the refrigerated egg section and in the freezer case) or EggReplacer (free of egg, dairy, corn, soy and gluten) a dried product, to replace eggs and lower fat and cholesterol in recipes. * Use buttermilk or yogurt in place of milk for lighter finer-textured products.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 tablespoons Raw brown rice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 Whole cloves</li>
      <li>Tea leaves from 2 earl Grey tea bags, removed from packets</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>2 6oz boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Take 3 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil 15 inches square and start rolling the edges under to from a circle that fits in the bottom of your Dutch oven -- in our case, a foil saucer approximately 5 inches in diamerter. When the edge is rolled to about 1 inch high, stop and flatten it. Then, depress the center to hold the smoke ingredients. In the depression of the aluminum foil saucer first sprinkle the rice, then the sugar, cloves and the contents of the tea bags. The order of ingredients is very important. Place the foil dish in Dutch oven, cover tightly and cook over high heat until ingredients in the foil start smoking ~- about 5 minutes. Brush a steamer platform with the olive oil. Place the chicken on platform, skinned side up. Put into Dutch oven over the smoke ingredients, cover and continue smoking over high heat until done -- about 11 minutes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat chicken broth to simmering in a small saucepan and leave on very low heat. In a heavy- based, wide saucepan heat olive oil, add onions and cook~ until golden over medium heat. Add rice and stir to coat each and every grain with oil. Begin by adding 1 cup of hot stock, stirring with a wooden spoon to mix. Allow this liquid to be absorbed, then add 1/2 cup stock, stirring until evaporated. Continue to add broth by 1/2 cupfuls, stirring after each addition. Continue until rice begins to soften. Last addition of stock should just absorb into rice, leaving it slightly tight. Stirring quickly with a wooden spoon, add butter and cream . Risotto will become very creamy. Stir in herbs and cheese. Remove from heat and adjust seasoning to taste. Serve topped with freshly-grated cheese and drizzle with truffle oil, if using.

      <li>1 package Dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup Warm water; (105 deg.F. to 115 deg.F.)</li>
      <li>3 cups All-purpose flour; divided</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Basic Pizza Crust From: Cooking Light magazine, Sept./Oct. 1991 issue Dissolve sugar and yeast in 1 cup warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Stir in 2 3/4 cups flour, salt, and oil to form a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Place dough in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning dough to coat top. Cover dough and let rise in a warm place (85 deg.F.), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and divide in half. Roll each half of dough into a 12 inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Place dough on 12-inch pizza pans or baking sheets coated with cooking spray and each sprinkled with 1/2 Tablespoon cornmeal. Crimp edges of dough with fingers to form a rim. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 deg.F.), free from drafts, 30 minutes. Top and bake according to recipe directions. Yield: 2 (12-inch) pizza crusts (about 720 calories each). Note: Store half of dough in freezer up to 1 month, if desired. Let dough rise; punch down, and divide in half. Dust half with flour, wrap in plastic wrap, and store in a zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag in freezer. To thaw, place dough in refrigerator 12 hours or overnight; bring to room temperature, and shape as desired.

      <li>1/3 cups Warm water (110 degrees F.)</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups Warm water (110 degrees F.)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Honey</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>About 3 1/2 cups unbleached flour</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/3 cup warm water. Let it proof until puffy, about 10 minutes. Stir together the yeast mixture, remaining warm water, honey, salt, olive oil and 1 cup of the flour in a large mixing bowl. Whisk until blended. Add remaining flour, a little at a time. Turn out the dough onto a floured board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes while you wash the bowl and rub it with a few teaspoons of olive oil. Then knead dough for 3 minutes. Place dough in bowl and turn to coat it well with the olive oil. Let rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk. Punch down dough. At this point you may form the pizzas, or refrigerate the dough for several hours, well wrapped in plastic so it won't dry out. (Although a refrigerator rest is not necessary, it makes the dough easier to handle.) Makes enough dough for two 12-inch pizzas, or two 10-inch thick-crust pizzas. San Francisco Chronicle, 2/6/91.

      <li>Ingredients: 2 cups flour 3 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp salt (very important) 1/4 cup sugar 2 eggs (or equivalent egg beaters) 2 tblsp oil 1 cup milk Sift (I never do) dry ingredients in bowl and stir in liquid ingredients with wire whisk or spoon until mixed. Do not beat. Rub griddle or fry pan with oil. Heat until water dropped from your hand bounces around. Drop about 1/2 ladel/1 large mixing spoon for each pancake. Cook until bubbled all over the top and brown on bottom. Flip, cook until brown on other side. Keep you griddle very hot at all times. Variations: 1. Substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for white flour. 2. Substitute buttermilk for whole milk and 1 tsp baking SODA for 1/2 tsp baking powder. 3. Put some pecan or walnut pieces in with your dry ingredients (this keeps them from sinking). Or put in some blueberries .. also with dry ingredients. 4. Increase your eggs. This will make them a little more like a crepe. Top with sliced apples, brown sugar and cinnamon and fold in half. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% From: lsamura@iniki.soest.hawaii.edu Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40 From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>From: Wendy Lockman &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt; Date: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 18:32:28 -0400 Bring water to a boil in a large heavy pot. Add salt and reduce heat until water is simmering. Take cornmeal by the handful and add to water very slowly, controlling the flow to a thin stream through your fingers. To avoid lumps, stir quickly with a long handled wooden spoon while adding cornmeal. If necessary, stop adding cornmeal from time to time and beat mixture vigorously. Cook, stirring constantly, 20 to 30 minutes. Polenta will become very thick while cooking. It is done when it comes away cleanly from the sides of the pot. Pour polenta into a large wooden board or a large platter. Wet your hands and smooth out polenta evenly, about 2 inches thick. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes or until polenta solidifies. Cut cooled polenta into slices 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Place slices in individual dishes. Serve hot, covered with your favorite sauce. Makes 6 to 8 servings. Variation: Fried Polenta (Polenta Fritta): Prepare polenta and let cool completely. Cut cooled polenta into slices 2 inches wide and 6 inches long. Pour oil about 1 inch deep in a large skillet. Heat oil until a 1-inch cube of bread turns golden almost immediately. Fry polenta slices on both sides until light golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot. It is importent to insure the oil is hot enough, otherwise the polenta will absorb oil and your polenta will be greasy and unpalatable.

    <title>Basic Risotto and Several Variations</title>

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Pure olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large Onion; peeled and finely di</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups Chicken stock</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Heavy cream</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Pick through the rice to remove any stones or foreign matter, but do not wash it before cooking. Using a large skillet with a heavy bottom, heat the olive oil over low eat and saute or "sweat" the onions until translucent, being careful not to allow them to color or brown at all. Add the Arborio rice, stir to coat with the olive oil, and saute with the onions to toast each grain of rice, about 7 minutes. This toasting process adds the chewy, al dente quality that attracts so many people to risotto. Once the rice is lightly toasted, add the white wine slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon. (A wooden spoon is always preferable when making risotto, as a metal spoon tends to cut or injure the grains of rice. Constant stirring should be avoided for the same reason.) Preheat the chicken stock just to the boiling point, then have it ready at stoveside. After the rice has absorbed the white wine and the skillet is nearly dry, add 1 cup stock, stirring occasionally, and cook over very low heat until the stock is absorbed. Continue adding the stock, 1 cup at a time, until all the stock has been absorbed. (Adding the liquid in stages, instead of all at once, allows the grains of rice to expand more fully, adding to the risotto's creamy texture.) Once the rice has been added to the pan, the entire cooking process will take about 17 to 20 minutes. After all of the liquid has been added and the rice is chewy yet fully cooked, with a creamy texture, add the butter, Parmesan, and heavy cream. Stir to combine all the ingredients and serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings Variations: Sauteed shrimp Mixed seafood (such as salmon, shrimp, and scallops) sauteed in live oil and herbs Diced fresh vegetables, steamed or sauteed in olive oil (asparagus and carrots make a wonderful combination) Fresh green peas in season Sauteed mushrooms and herbs Roasted Garlic (recipe follows) Recipe By : COOKING LIVE SHOW #CL8724 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #235 Date: Sat, 5 Oct 1996 15:58:31 -0500 From: "Jon and Angele Freeman" &lt;jfreeman@netusa1.net&gt;</li>

      <li>Combine the above ingredients to make a dough. wrap in a towel and let sit for 30 minutes. [start the sauce heating...] After the 30 minutes, [start the water boiling] divide the dough in half and roll out each half, allowing the first sheet of pasta to sit while rolling out the second. When the sheets are dryish, cut according to how you like your pasta. The pasta maker recommends rolling, and folding in half before rerolling. after rolling you are supposed to sprinkle some flour betwixt the two halves. If you create a dry enough dough, then you do not need to do this. in fact, the first time through the rollers, my dough is pretty crumbly at the edges, but a few more passes makes the dough much more workable. Cook for about 2 minutes. Posted by "BrownleeS" &lt;BrownleeS@dsmo.com&gt; Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #169 by Nancy Miller &lt;millern@redwood.cc.andrews.edu&gt; on Jul 1, 1997</li>

      <li>Anyone ever serve polenta with Q? Im thinking it might be good with a spicy brisket or ribs. Anyone have any recipes? Here is the only one I have. I just got it so I dont know if it is any good, but it came from the Chef Du Jour show. In a medium cast-iron saucepan or other heavy pot, bring all ingredients except cornmeal to simmer over medium heat. Very slowly, begin to sift cornmeal into the pan through the fingers of one hand, stirring constantly with wooden spoon or whisk. Gradually sift remaining meal into the pan, continue to stir and reduce heat to medium low. Continue to stir until the polenta is smooth and thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan as it is stirred, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf, pour polenta into a serving bowl or onto a wooden board, and allow it to rest 10 minutes. To serve from the bowl, dip a large spoon into water and scoop polenta onto individual dishes, dipping the spoon into the water between scoops. To serve from the board, cut polenta into segments with a thin, taut string or knife and transfer to plates with a spatula or cake knife.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Date: Fri, 22 Mar 1996 15:48:29 -0500 From: Walt Gray &lt;waltgray@mnsinc.com&gt; Here is one that I really like. It works well on Chiles Rellanos. Wearing gloves, use a small knife to remove chile stems and seeds, then wash the chiles well. Place in a saucepan with the water and bring to a boil over high heat; boil for 5 minutes, then allow to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Whirl the water and chiles in a food processor or blender, in batches if necessary, for 20 to 30 seconds, or until the skins are finely chopped. Pass through a strainer, pressing the chile pieces through with a wooden spoon. In a medium skillet, make a roux by combining the flour and oil. Saute over low heat for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, chile mixture, oregano and vinegar. Stir well and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for about 5 days, or it can be frozen for 2 to 3 months. NOTE: For a spicy sauce, use 1 New Mexico and 7 California chiles. Eliminate the New Mexico chile for a milder sauce. MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #83 From the MealMaster recipe list.

      <li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
      <li>4 Eggs</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons Very cold water</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a large bowl mix the flour and salt. Make a well in center of flour. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing slightly after each addition. Add gradually the water and oil. Mix well to make a stiff dough. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Divide dough into fourths. Lightly roll each portion 1/8" thick and cut lengthwise into 5" wide strips. Use the strips immediately, do not allow to dry. Place 2 teaspoons of whatever filling you are using 1 1/2 " from the narrow end and in the center of the strip. Continue along the strip, placing the filling at 3" intervals. Fold the strip in half lengthwise, covering the mounds of filling. To seal, press the edges together with the tines of a fork. Press gently between the mounds to form rectangles 3" long. Cut apart with a pastry cutter and press the cut edges with the tines of a fork to seal. Let the ravioli dry for about 2 hrs. Then in a large saucepan bring to a boil: 7 quarts water with 2 Tb salt. Gradually add the ravioli. Boil rapidly, uncovered, about 10 min or until tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain. Place on a warm platter and top with a sauce.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 Scallions, very finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 Fresh green chilies, seeded and very finely chopped (up to 2)</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Chopped coriander leaves</li>
      <li>3 Chicken-breast fillets weighing about 12 oz (350 g)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>4 Eggs</li>
      <li>The Juice of 1-1/2 inch (4-cm) piece of fresh ginger crushed in a garlic press, or the grated piece</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Light vegetable oil for deep-frying, about 1 inch (2- 1/2 cm) deep</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Chop the scallions, chilies (half a chili is enough for me), and coriander in the food processor. Then add the chicken, flour, eggs, ginger, and salt, and process until the chicken is finely chopped and all the ingredients are well blended. (I have overprocessed the chicken to a paste by mistake, and the result was also delightful). Chill, covered, for 1-2 hours. Deep-fry by the heaping tablespoon (dip the spoon in oil so that the mixture does not stick) in medium-hot oil, turning over once, until browned all over. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot or cold. The recipe makes about fourteen 2 1/2-inch (6-cm) fritters and up to thirty-six tiny ones. VARIATION: An Indian Baghdadi arook thayin is made with a pinch of turmeric. SERGIO'S NOTES: Jews from Calcutta, Cochin, Persia, and Iraq began to settle in Burma, in Southeast Asia, in the mid-nineteenth century. It was Jews of Baghdadi origin who organized the congregation, and it is their style of cooking that influenced the Jewish style that developed locally. During the Japanese occupation, almost all the community fled, many of them to India. This recipe was given to someone I know by Mrs. Philomene Jacobs of the Baghdadi community in India. These delectable fritters - soft and creamy, gingery and peppery - make splendid finger food. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #204 by Linda Shapiro &lt;lss@coconet.com&gt; on Jun 28, 1997</li>

      <li>1. In 5-quart nonaluminum saucepot, heat water and potatoes to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook potatoes 10 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, trim artichokes: Snap off and discard tough outer green leaves, stopping at the point where the leaves are half green and half yellow. Cut each stem even with base; cut 1/2 inch off each top. 3. With slotted spoon, remove potatoes to colander; set aside to cool slightly. Add artichokes and lemon juice to same water in which potatoes were cooked. Heat to boiling over high heat; cook 10 minutes. Drain artichokes well and set aside to cool slightly. 4. Meanwhile, cut cooled potatoes lengthwise into quarters; cut quarters in half crosswise. When artichokes are cool enough to handle, cut them lengthwise into quarters. Cut out any interior leaves that are purple or pink. 5. Heat oven to 450 degrees F. In large bowl, mix artichokes, potatoes, oil, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper. Spread mixture in single layer on rimmed baking sheet and roast on bottom rack of oven 10 minutes. With spatula, turn mixture and roast vegetables until lightly browned -- 5 to 10 minutes longer.

      <li>I have a new cookbook--A Seafood Celebration. It is a fabulous book that really teaches you everything about cooking fish. It also contains lots of great recipes including sauces, salsas, etc. Since the book was such a bargain I feel I want to share some of the recipes with you. Today I am going to send you two recipes for poaching fish. If you have any questions regarding poaching fish, please e-mail me and I will try to find the answer for you. Poaching fish is a wonderful and healthy way to prepare fish. Mary Curtis In a 12-inch saute pan, bring all the ingredients except the milk to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Add the milk and simmer for 10 minutes more. Strain, pressing the vegetable and herb solids against the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. This milk-based court boullion is best for poaching delicate-tasting white-fleshed fish such as cod, haddock, and halibut. After using it, reduce it by half and freeze it to use as a base for veloute or other sauces. Posted to EAT-L Digest by mary curtis &lt;curtism@FUSE.NET&gt; on Feb 19, 1998</li>

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Onion peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 Steak dried salt cod</li>
      <li>1 Ripe tomato (or dbl. amt.) peeled, cored and very coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 2/3 cups Short-grain rice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Short-grain rice adds the perfect texture to this traditional dish from northern Portugal. The salt cod may eliminate the need for additional salt. BROWN THE ONION in the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Meanwhile, shred the cod, remove the skin and bones and wash but do not soak. Add the cod to the onion, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and leave to cook 20-to-30 minutes, covered, over low heat. Meanwhile, wash and drain the rice. Add 3 1/3 cups water to the pan (add twice as much water as there is rice), season to taste with salt and pepper. When the water boils, add the rice and continue to cook on low heat until the rice is done--probably 25-to-30 minutes. Cover the kettle for the last half of cooking.

    <quantity>6</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>Jim Vorheis</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Unconverted long-grain rice</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Safflower oil, melted chicken fat, or melted lard</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Finely chopped white onion</li>
      <li>2 Chilies poblanos, charred, peeled, and cut in strips</li>
      <li>4 cups Chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup Firmly packed, roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Firmly packed, roughly chopped epazote or cilantro</li>
      <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
      <li>Green Rice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put the rice into a bowl and pour very hot water over to cover; stir and set aside for 10 minutes. Drain in a strainer and rinse in cold water; drain again and set aside. Heat the oil in a heavy pan, stir the rice into it, and fry over fairly high heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the onion and chile strips and continue frying for 4 minutes or until the onion is translucent. Meanwhile, put 1 cup of the broth into a blender jar; add the garlic, parsley, and epazote and blend until smooth. Add this to the frying rice and continue frying and reducing the puree over quite high heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the rice is dry. Stir in the rest of the broth, add salt to taste, and cook over fairly high heat, uncovered, until the liquid has been absorbed and there are air holes in the rice. Cover with a towel and lid and continue cooking over low heat for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, still covered, in a warm place for the rice to swell up. Before serving, turn the rice over with a fork from the bottom where a lot of the flavor and oil will have settled.

      <li>From: kmeade@ids2.idsonline.com (The Meades) Date: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 18:48:14 -0400 This, too, is a Portuguese recipe, from the Algarve. It can be made with octopuses of any size. Baby ones won't need so much precooking. Precook 600 to 800 g octopus in 200 mL red wine with a little water. The octopus will exude liquid so that you are likely to end up with more cooking liquid at the end. Retain this and add water to make it up to 600 ea mL. Cut the drained octopus into small pieces. Heat 150 mL olive oil in a large saucepan, add a chopped onion and cook gently, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add 2 garlic cloves finely chopped, 3 tomatoes, skinned and chopped, and a large green pepper cut into snips. Season with salt, pepper and chilli powder to taste. Cook for a few minutes longer. Add the cooking liquid from the octopus and bring it to the boil. Add 350 g rice (preferable a short-grain risotto rice like arborio) and bring back to the boil, then turn the heat very low and put the lid on the saucepan. After 15 minutes, stir to ensure the rice is not catching on the bottom of the saucepan. In 5 minutes more, taste a grain or two to make sure it is soft. The rice should still be quite damp. Serve. Makes 4 servings. From Meryl Constance' column in the Sydney Morning Herald, "Raw Materials". 3/2/93. Courtesy, Mark Herron. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; June 4 1993.

    <quantity>8</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)</li>
      <li>3 pounds Potatoes (about 5 oz each)</li>
      <li>1 Lemon (may be doubled)</li>
      <li>Honey</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Rosemary, thyme &amp; oregano</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan. Bruise the leaves of 2 or 3 sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat. Add plenty of pepper and 1 tablespoon honey. Rub the mixture into the meat with your hands. Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing the juice on to the meat as you do so. Do not add any salt. Leave to marinate for 4 to 24 hours. Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer round the lamb. Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at least half a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong citrus flavour. Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the roasting pan, then sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh chopped thyme and oregano, and some salt and pepper. Drizzle on 1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon olive oil, then dot with 1 oz butter. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for a further 1 to 1-1/4 hours. The ingredients will become gilded and will burnish to a rich brown in places. Lift the meat and turn the potatoes occasionally, and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to prevent drying out.

Cook as directed. The rice gets a beautiful yellow color and a heady aroma from the saffron and bay leaf. The bay leaf will be resting on top of the rice at the end of cooking. Remove and discard it before serving. Serve as a side dish with a meat, fish, or vegetarian entree. Plain Rice Pilav: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 2. If using white rice, you will need 4 cups stock. If using brown rice you will use 5 cups stock. 3. If using white rice, place the rice in a colander and rinse it in the sink in cold water until the water runs clear. Allow the rice to drain and dry for 20 minutes. If using brown rice, skip this step. 4. Over medium heat, heat the olive oil in a casserole with a tight fitting lid. Saute the rice in the oil until it starts to brown. 5. Sprinkle the salt over the rice and pour in the stock. Cover tightly and place in the oven. Bake for 35-40 minutes (white rice) to 1 hour (brown rice). When the pilaf is done, all of the liquid will have been absorbed. A lovely aroma will fill the room when you open the lid of the pot. Serve immediately as a side dish with a meat, fish or vegetarian entree. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #316 by Jeff Freedman &lt;jefffree@eskimo.com&gt; on Dec 03, 1997</li>

      <li>Cut fish fillets in half, making triangular shape. Cover with milk and lemon juice and refrigerate 3-4 hours. Drain off milk. Dip fillets in flour to coat each piece lightly. Let dry on a cookie sheet, making sure pieces do not tough. Add oil to deep fryer or heavy pan to a depth of at least 3 inches. Heat oil to 425~. Combine pancake mix, basil, pepper, garlic salt and enough soda to make a thick batter, about the consistency of buttermilk. Dip floured fillets in batter and add to the hot oil one at a time. Fry 4-5 minutes. Remove filets to cookie sheet, again, not letting them touch and keep warm in a 250~ oven. Deep fry remaining filets, keeping the depth of the oil at least 3 inches. NOTE: Do not heap fish as this creates steam in the oven and makes coating soft.

Stir in the lemon juice and saffron mixture, then add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the fresh peas, if using, otherwise add the frozen peas during the last 10 minutes of cooking time. Reduce the heat so that the liquid is simmering. Cover and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. Serve hot.

    <ingredient>
      <li>Jim Vorheis</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Unconverted long-grain rice</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Safflower oil, melted chicken fat, or melted lard</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Finely chopped white onion</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups Light chicken broth, approximately</li>
      <li>1 cup Fresh corn kernels or 1/3 cup carrot rounds</li>
      <li>Plus 1/2 cup fresh peas (optional)</li>
      <li>1 Parsley sprig</li>
      <li>2 Whole chilies serranos</li>
      <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
      <li>White Rice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put the rice into a bowl and cover with very hot water. Stir once and leave to soak for 10 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again. Heat the oil in a heavy pan. Give the rice a final shake and stir into the fat. Fry over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring almost continuously. Add the onion and garlic and continue frying until the rice is just turning a pale gold and the onion is transparent - about 3 to 5 minutes longer. Pour in the broth and, if used, the vegetables and parsley or fresh chilies, add salt to taste, stir once again for the last time, and cook over fairly high heat, uncovered, until all the broth has been absorbed and air holes appear in the surface. Cover the surface of the rice with a towel and lid and continue cooking over very low heat for 5 minutes more. Remove from the heat and set aside in a warm place for the rice to absorb the rest of the moisture in the steam and swell ~ about 15 minutes. Dig gently to the bottom and test a grain of rice. If it is still damp, cook for a few minutes longer. If the top grains are not quite soft, then sprinkle with a little more hot broth, cover, and cook for a few minutes longer. Before serving, turn the rice over from the bottom so that the flavored juices will be distributed evenly.

      <li>1 cup White rice</li>
      <li>7 Strips of lemon peel</li>

      <li>Today's Helping of Chicken Soup for the Soul... Arroz con Leche I still remember the sweet aroma of cinnamon, sugar, rice and milk filling the rooms of her tiny house. As a small child there was nothing much better than eating a bowl of her hot rice pudding straight from the stove. My brother, sister and I would gobble our first servings then beg for seconds. Grandmother's laughter would fill the kitchen as she happily refilled our bowls. Today, relatives on my father's side gather each December in her memory. We lay out a huge spread of traditional family foods, rolls, cheeses, hams, salads, olives and garlic butter. But none taste quite as good as they did when Grandma made them. As dessert time approaches, everyone whispers, "Did Aunt Juanita make the Arroz con Leche?" Aunt Juanita is the oldest of my grandmother's five daughters and one son. She likes to keep whether or not she has made the rice pudding a mystery - when she feels ready she ceremoniously brings out the Arroz con Leche. She carefully dishes out small portions - making sure everyone gets their fair share. Fortunately, her Arroz con Leche always tastes just the way "Grandma used to make it." Over the years I have come to realize that the secret ingredients my grandmother, Maria Encarnacion Navarro Cortez, always included in everything she made were huge doses of laughter and love. Those are the elements none of us will ever forget. My brother, sister and I figured out that in order to get bigger portions of Arroz con Leche we needed to learn to make it for ourselves. I know you will appreciate our passion for it as soon as you taste your first spoonful! Here is Aunt Juanita's recipe from Grandma Cortez. It takes time, patience and a lot of love. 1. In a large non-stick pot, heat the whole milk, white rice, lemon peel and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Turn down heat to low setting and cook for approximately 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Test a grain of the rice to see if it is almost soft; if not, continue to cook until soft. 2. Stir in sugar and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Place over a low setting and cook very slowly for approximately 30 more minutes, stirring often. Cook until thick - not too soupy and not too dry. 3. Transfer to a 2-quart serving bowl. Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Allow to cool - it will set like a pudding. Tastes delicious chilled or warm from the stove. Enjoy!

Drain, reserve the cooking liquied, and discard the bay leaf. There should be 3 cups of liquid; if necessary, add some water to make that amount. If using cooked or canned chick-peas, use 4 cups water in place of the reserved cooking liquid. In a large, heavy casserole, cook the salt pork, stirring over low heat 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper, chorizo, and bacon, and cook over low heat until the onions are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper, sherry, rice, reserved cooking liquied, and chick-peas, and stir to blend. Cook over medium-high heat until most of the liquied has been absorbed and small craters appear over the top of the rice, 10 to 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, stir the rice with a fork, cover, and cook until the rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the salt pork and serve.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 Duckling</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Thyme, whole dried</li>
      <li>2 Bay leaf; crumbled</li>
      <li>6 Cloves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar, brown</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Brandy</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
      <li>5 Red cabbage leaves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Cut off the wingtips from the duck and wrap them up with the giblets for making stock. Pull out and discard any loose interior fat. Rinse the duck inside and out and pat dry, inside and out. Mix together in a spice mill or mortar the peppercorns, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and salt. Grind to a fine texture. Combine in a small dish with the brown sugar and brandy. Place the duck in a heavy plastic bag that fits snugly. Rub half the spice mixture inside the duck and the remaining half over the outside. Place the garlic in the duck's cavity. Close the bag tightly and refrigerate 24 hours, rubbing the surface and squeezing in the spices occasionally. Remove the duck from the bag and gently pat it dry. Set it on a cake rack over a plate and return it, uncovered, to the refrigerator for another 24 hours or so, turning it once. Pat the duck to dry it thoroughly (if not already dry) and let it come to room temperature (at least two hours). Preheat the oven to 300. Using a large needle and white cotton thread, sew closed the neck and tail openings. Place the duck on its side on a rack set in a roasting pan. Roast the duck for 45 minutes. With the needle, prick the fatty parts on the upper side; do not prick deeply enough to pierce the flesh. Grab the duck by the legs and turn it over onto the other side. Increase the oven temperature to 350 and roast 30 minutes. Price the fatty parts on the upturned side and then turn the duck onto its breast. Increase the heat to 400 and roast about 30 minutes longer, or until the duck is deeply browned and most of the fat has melted away. Remove from the oven and let cool 1 to 3 hours before serving. To serve: Using a heavy cleaver or poultry shears, cut through flesh and bone of the duck carefully to make about 12 to 14 serving pieces, keeping the skin neatly intact on each piece. Spread the cabbage leaves over a platter, shallow basket or wooden bowl and arrange the duck on them. If the duck is to be served hot, arrange the cut pieces in a pan in a single layer, cut side down, and roast in a preheated 350 oven 15 minutes. --- Food &amp; Wine magazine From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>This, too, is a Portuguese recipe++from the Algarve. It can be made with octopuses of any size. Baby ones won't need so much precooking. Precook 600 to 800 g octopus in 200 mL red wine with a little water. The octopus will exude liquid so that you are likely to end up with more cooking liquid at the end. Retain this and add water to make it up to 600 ea mL. Cut the drained octopus into small pieces. Heat 150 mL olive oil in a large saucepan, add a chopped onion and cook gently, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add 2 garlic cloves finely chopped, 3 tomatoes, skinned and chopped, and a large green pepper cut into snips. Season with salt, pepper and chilli powder to taste. Cook for a few minutes longer. Add the cooking liquid from the octopus and bring it to the boil. Add 350 g rice (preferable a short-grain risotto rice like arborio) and bring back to the boil, then turn the heat very low and put the lid on the saucepan. After 15 minutes, stir to ensure the rice is not catching on the bottom of the saucepan. In 5 minutes more, taste a grain or two to make sure it is soft. The rice should still be quite damp. Serve. Makes 4 servings. From Meryl Constance' column in the Sydney Morning Herald, "Raw Materials". 3/2/93. Courtesy, Mark Herron. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; June 4 1993.

      <li>Use a 3-quart casserole with lid. An earthenware casserole is preferable, especially if you wish to add a touch of Spain to a dinner party. However, I know that good earthenware is hard to find today. I have 2 casseroles that I've had for 15 years. Heat oil in casserole. Saute onion and pepper until transparent. Add garlic, parsley, tomato, bay leaf, nutmeg, cumin and thyme. Mix well, cover, and cook over low heat until mushy (about 15 minutes). The saffron should be toasting on the lid in the little brown paper. Add the shrimp to the saute and cook until it turns pink. Dissolve the saffron in the 1 cup hot water. Combine with wine, lemon juice, salt and hot sauce. Pour into casserole, stir to mix, and cook covered 10 minutes more. Now add the rice and the 2 1/2 cups of water. Distribute ingredients well in casserole. Bring to a quick boil, STIR ONCE, and place in preheated 325 degree F. oven for only 20 minutes - NI UN MINUTO MAS! Remove from oven, uncover, and garnish with peas, pimientos, and parsley. Pour beer over all. Cover again and allow to stand 15 minutes longer, before serving.

Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in another saucepan, and add rice. Boil uncovered for 30 minutes or until rice is tender.(Some rice will take considerable less time.) Be careful not to overcool. Drain off excess water. Mix scalded and evaporated milk, sugar, and cinnamon in a medium saucepan. Cook for 45 minutes or until mixture begins to thicken and changes color. Add rice and raisins. Cook for 40 minutes or until pudding thickens. Remove from heat, and stir occasionally until pudding cools thoroughly. To serve, spoon rice pudding onto a platter, and sprinkle with cinnamon. The pudding can be cooked until it is very thick,if desired. It also can be shaped into patties and dipped in beaten eggs and rolled inbread crumbs before frying in oil and butter until light brown. The patties are rolled in cinnamon and sugar before serving. Chanteclair's note - my long grain rice would be mush if cooked that long, and it isn't converted. I would suggest that if you just cooked rice the way you normally do (but more al dente). The long cooking process is to partially caramelize the sugar in the pudding. I suggest you lightly caramelize the sugar before you start - or maybe cheat and use brown sugar. I have had this recipe - prepared the tradtional way - and it was delicious.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Roast the chilies or peppers, remove their skins, stems, seeds and thick white membranes and discard. Chop the chilies into chunks. Combine 1 cup of the chunks and 1/2 cup of stock in the jar of a blender and blend at high speed for 15 seconds. Then gradually add the remaining chilies and the parsley, onions, garlic, salt and pepper, blending until the mixture is reduced to a smooth puree. (To make the sauce by hand, puree the chilies, parsley, onions and garlic, a cup or so at a time, in a food mill set over a bowl. Discard any pulp left in the mill. Stir in 1/2 cup of stock and the salt and pepper.) Pour the oil into a 2 to 3 quart casserole and set it over moderate heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the rice and stir constantly for 2 to 3 minutes until the grains are coated with oil. Do not let them brown. Now add the pureed chili mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the remaining 3 1/2 cups of stock to a boil in a small saucepan and pour it over the rice. Return to a boil, cover the casserole and reduce the heat to its lowest point. Simmer undisturbed for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Before serving, fluff the rice with a fork. If the rice must wait, remove the cover and drape the pan loosely with a towel. Place in a preheated 250 degree (F) oven to keep warm. 77 of 108 Source: Time Life Series: Latin American Cooking MMed by: earl.cravens@salata.com Beach, CA * 310-543-0439 V.32bis (1:102/125) ® ¯ BBS: Sound Advice (816) 436-4516 Date: Sat, 12-17-94 (04:36) Number: 17703 Refer: 0 To: ALL From: EARL CRAVENS Subj: Foods/Latin Amer.78 -108 Conf: InterCook (823) Read: No Status: Public From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

In a large, flame-proof casserole dish or a large pot suitable for table service, heat the oil and garlic clove over moderate heat until the garlic begins to turn brown. Remove the garlic and discard. Add to the hot oil the chicken, pork, and ham. Cook until browned evenly, about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside. To the pork and ham, add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Saute until the onion is translucent and the pepper soft, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, stirring well to absorb liquids. Stir in the tomato paste. Add the saffron water, the white wine, and the boiling water. Add salt, about 2 tsp., and fresh ground black pepper, about 1 tsp. to taste. Return the chicken to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Stir in the peas, pimento, olives, shrimp, and parsley. Bring to a boil again. Immediately reduce the heat, cover, and simmer 20 to 30 minutes or until the chicken is tender and the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Serve directly from the casserole or pot. Note: For perfect rice, use 2-1/2 cups of liquid for each cup of rice. For a richer taste, use chicken stock or fortify water with chicken base or bouillon cubes.

    <title>Art's Stuffed Jalapeno Peppers</title>
    <category>Appetizers</category>
    <category>Hot and spi</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>12 Jalapeno peppers</li>
      <li>4 ounces Cream cheese; room temperature</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Onion; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cheddar cheese; shredded</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Granulated garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Dried parsley</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Dried chives</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Old Bay Seasonings (TM) [Seafood Spice</li>
      <li>Mixture]</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Ham; cooked bacon, or other leftover meat, finely chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In a two-quart sauce pan, bring one quart of water to a rolling boil. While it is reaching a boil, Cut a long flap in each jalapeno, starting from the shoulder and running close to the tip; this should be an elongated "V" shaped flap. Lift the flap and clean out the fibers and seeds (this is where most of the heat is); I use either a round-tipped peeling device or a teaspoon. When water reaches boiling point, immerse cleaned peppers in the water and reduce heat to medium. Let peppers parboil for about 10 minutes.... better that they be a little undercooked then overcooked. Mix the rest of the ingredients together, turning and blending until the cream cheese is well mixed into the rest of the ingredients. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little sour cream, pickle juice, vinegar, anything in the fridge you think might add a touch of individuality. Remove peppers, dump into a strainer, and run cold water over them. Lift the flap of each pepper and stuff the cheese mixture into the pocket; fold the flap back down over the stuffing. A little overstuffing is OK. Place the peppers on a sprayed pan and bake at 400 degrees for about 10 0 15 minutes; just until the cheese begins to melt out of the peppers. Remove and let cool for about 4 - 5 so the cheese sets up a little. Serve with a few crackers or tortilla chips. Parboiling the peppers removes a substantial portion of the raw heat, but leaves enough to give a nice burn to the mouth. I fixed this as an appetizer for Doris and I tonight. They serve 2 - 3 people, depending on how soon dinner is to be served! Left over filling can be saved for several days for another batch or to eat on crackers, in celery, on (when no one is looking) by the forkful! NOTES : This recipe is my own creation.... tested, tasted, tested, tasted, etc. and true.

Pour the pepper mixture into a large non-aluminum pan and bring to a simmer. Stir in sugar gradually, bringing mixture to a boil. Boil for five minutes. Stir frequently through these processes. Remove from heat and let stand for five minutes; stir in fruit pectin and let cool slightly. Skim with slotted spoon if necessary.

      <li>Hearts, rinsed and drained</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a baking pan. Salt and pepper the chicken breasts. With a very sharp small knife, cut a pocket horizontally into each breast. Do not cut in half. Set aside while you make the stuffing. In a food processor, place the garlic, artichoke hearts, egg yolk, cream, bread crumbs, nutmeg and about 1/4 cup of parsley. Process to mix, but do not puree. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of stuffing in each breast pocket. Do not close the pocket-the stuffing will puff up and out a bit. Place the stuffed breasts in the baking dish. Pour the chicken broth over the chicken. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake 12 to 15 minutes. Place the breasts on a platter, spoon the pan juices over and sprinkle with reserved 2 tablespoons parsley.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Wash the wings, remove the tip and sever the wings at the joint. Arrange wing pieces in a large, flat baking dish, sprinkle with the vinegar and the cayenne pepper. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and cook in the microwave on high for 15 minutes; turn the wings and add some more cayenne in you like, re-cover and microwave for another 15 minutes. During the last 15 minutes, preheat the oven to 350 F and combine the remainder of the ingredients into a basting sauce. When the wings are finished in the microwave, drain the liquid off and apply some of the basting sauce to the top of the wings. Cook in the oven for about 25 minutes. Remove and turn the wings; baste with more sauce and return the wings to the oven for another 25 minutes. Check the wings occasionally through the cooking period, and baste as needed. After this cooking, the meat on wings should almost fall off the bones, but not quite! Let set for about 10 minutes before removing from the baking dish and arranging them on a platter.

      <li>Date: Wed, 13 Mar 1996 12:33:25 -0500 From: Annm665091@aol.com (Annmarie Chiarini) I hope this recipe is what you are looking for. My family is a very traditional Italian family who recently (well, 8 years ago) got into ff/lf veg dieting. We slimmed down many sauce recipies as well as reduced the acidity of the sauce. Enjoy! Saute the diced tomatoes and diced onion in a little water for a 3-5 minutes. Add the spices, diced garlic, pepper and onion. Melt in the tomato paste and simmer for 15-20 minutes, it will cook down to a nice light sauce. Add more tomato paste if you want a thicker sauce. Add more tomatoes if you want a chunkier sauce. I don't mean to be criptic with the measurements, my Grandmother taught me how to "sight cook" and I rarely use spoons or cups, if it smells good and the spices look evenly distributed, I'm happy.

      <li>Here is a recipe I use a lot for our church suppers and everyone likes it. It is from Gebhardt's Mexican Cookery for American Homes. Wash rice well and dry; brown raw rice in hot fat, add onion, green pepper, salt, Gebhardt's Chili Powder and tomatoes. Mix well and add just enough water to cover mixture. Cover with lid and allow to simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove lid to allow mixture to dry out. Do not stir after the cooking starts, as stirring tends to break the rice grains, causing mixture to become gummy.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1/2 pounds Chorizo (Spanish Sausage); cut in 3/4"pieces</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Achiote</li>
      <li>4 cups Hot Cooked Rice</li>

      <li>Salt And Freshly Ground Pepper; to taste</li>
      <li>4 Hard-Boiled Eggs; shelled/quartered</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Fry sausage until well cooked and browned. Remove sausage from pan; keep warm. If necessary, add enough oil to pan to make 2 tablespoons oil. Add achiote; cook until oil is red. Combine chorizo with rice, peas, and carrot in oil; mix, stirring frequently, until hot. Season to taste. Arrange quaretered eggs on top and serve immediately. NOTES : The Spanish use saffron to color their delicious paella, but in Puerto Rico and many South American countries achiote (annatto seed) is used to color native rice dishes. Achiote is tasteless. The red coloring is obtained by slowly heating it in oil. Recipe by: The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook By Betty L.

      <li>From: January, 1995 Food Guide column by Jerry Anne DiVecchio This is a great ingredient. Whole seeds can keep their flavor for years, but once in liquid, they become soft and easy to chew, while retaining their individual integrty. Makes a great gift! The proportions don't need to be precise. Substitute ground seeds if you have to. Store in a cool dark place. USE to flavor the water to cook vegetables like artichokes. Just dump some seeds generously into the boiling water. Add to vegetable soup purees -- like carrot. Add to braised meats for roasts and stews, like Succulent Lamb Shanks (Sunset) see recipe.

    <ingredient>
      <li>3 Split chicken Breasts</li>
      <li>1 cup Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette Salad Dressing</li>
      <li>Seasoned Salt</li>
      <li>Black Pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dale's Sauce</li>
      <li>Spice Hunter's Chicken Roasting Rub</li>
      <li>Cinnamon</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(from the Kitchen of Doom) Mix the dressing and the Dale's, and let the mix chill in the fridge while you skin the chicken breasts. (My bow to the Fat Police-) Rub the chicken with seasoned salt, pepper, and the Roasting mix to taste. When that's done, put the chicken and the dressing mix in a bowl, and marinade for at least an hour. Turn the oven on at 350. Arrange the chicken breasts, meat side up, in a pan, and pour the marinade over them. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon. Let them cook until nearly done, basting often. Increase the oven temp to 400 for the last few minutes of cooking time. The chicken should have a nice, dark red color when it comes out of the oven. And it smells wonderful while it's cooking. Be sure you baste it fairly often, though. I have a feeling that it would try to dry out if you gave it the chance. I served my red chicken with nibblets, pineapples, and baked potatoes. If you don't have Dale's Sauce around (it's a regional thing, I think-) you can sub dark soy sauce with a little worchestershire in it and get basicly the same taste and effect. The Spice Hunter's rub is a spicy mix of things like curry and cumin. Use it sparingly. Posted to EAT-L Digest by JoAnne F Spencer &lt;brightfires@JUNO.COM&gt; on Dec 17, 1997</li>

I think it's comforting, and it's definitely easy to eat! My favorite is Jackie Manni's recipe for "cream" of corn soup: Saute onion and corn in a few tspns of water, adding more if it gets dry. Add cornmeal, stirring to avoid lumps, and so all veggies are covered. Slowly add water and stir to once again avoid lumps. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 40 min. Add salt/tamari at end. I am not a big soup fan, but I had 2 bowls of this stuff. The best part is, you can make a ton and not have to cook for a while. FATFREE DIGEST V96 #148 From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.

    <category>Beverages</category>
    <quantity>22</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>4 7/16 pounds Rice</li>
      <li>4 7/16 pounds Raisins</li>
      <li>11 pounds Sugar</li>
      <li>4 1/4 ounces Yeast (baking)</li>
      <li>38 pints Boiled water</li>
      <li>1 Wormwood</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Put rice and water directly into the container. Scald the raisins before adding them as they contain wild yeast. Stir the yeast in some lukewarm water and add to the container together with the boiled water which is now also lukewarm. A bag made of cheese cloth (or equivalent) measuring 10"*16" filled with dried wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and a stone is placed at the bottom of the container. Stir as frequently as possible for the next 8 days. Then leave for 2-3 months before bottling. This wine is very dry and perfect for cooking (use instead of white wine or sherry).

    <title>"English" Muffins (Bakestone Recipes)</title>
    <category>Breads</category>
    <category>Breakfast</category>
    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound All-purpose or bread flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
      <li>8 fluid ounces Warm milk and water</li>
      <li>2 ounces Butter, melted</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>(Note: Over here, and in England, these are just called "muffins", and are the ones in the song about the Muffin Man who lives in Drury Lane. They did actually sell them door-to-door every morning in London until the turn of the century or thereabouts.) . Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and leave in a warm place. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 pt of the warm milk and water. Leave to froth, then mix in the fat. Stir all the liquid into the warm flour and beat well until smooth and elastic. Cover and prove in a warm place for 50 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Turn onto a well-floured board and knead, working a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier to shape. Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage shape and (using the sharpest knife you have) slice into 8 to 10 portions, each about 1 1/2 ~ 1 3/4 inch thick. Shape each one into a round with straight sides. Put onto a greased baking sheet. Cover (I use greased plastic wrap) and put in a warm place to prove for 30-40 minutes or until springy to the touch. Leave room for expansion and be careful not to over-prove, as the muffins will get flabby and lose their shape. Warm and grease the bakestone lightly. Lift the muffins carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very moderate heat for 8-10 minutes until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook the other side. Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches. To serve, insert a knife in the side, pull the top and bottom slightly apart, and insert slivers of butter. . These are strongly recommended. The taste of them hot off the bakestone, griddle or frying pan makes Thomas's look very poor indeed by comparison. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <category>Sourdough</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 cups Flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1 package Active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>2 cups Warm water (105-115 F)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In large bowl mix flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Gradually stir in the water; beat or whisk until smooth. Cover with towel; set in warm (80 - 80 deg F) draft-free place - the kitchen or other warm room in summer or in cold weather on top of insulated furnace or radiator, on a buffer such as a folded heavy towel or pillow. Stir 2 or 3 times a day for about 3 days or until starter is bubbly an produces a yeasty aroma. Transfer to larger bowl, large jar or plastic container. Cover partially (tilt lid or punch holes in plastic cover); refrigerate. Makes about 1-1/2 to 2 cups starter, depending on thickness. It can be creamy or as thick as dough because of room conditions, the age of "Herman" and other variables. *Note about "Herman"* Herman is a "cultured" dough you add to new dough to give it distinctive flavor or texture it otherwise wouldn't have. But unlike other starters that require constant feeding, stirring and using, this one doesn't make a slave of you. You replentish "Herman" only after you use it. And if it's longer than 14 days, put it in the freezer until you're ready. The flavor of this starter evolves as it ages- mildly sweet when young, more like sourdough when older. Care and Feeding of "Herman" The starter should be used within 14 days and replenished or fed immediately after each use. To feed starter, stir or whisk in 1 cup each flour and milk and 1/2 cup sugar; misture need not be completely smooth. Wait at least 24 hours before using again. If you do not plan to use the starter within 14 days, cover tight and freeze. Freezing slows down the fermentation, so let stand at room temperature several hours or till thawed and bubbly before reusing.

      <li>Trim all fat from meat. Slice meat with the grain as thin as possible. The meat slices nicely when semi-frozen, or your butcher will do the slicing for you. Place the meat in cool brine and refrigerate overnight. After no less than 12 hours, take the meat from the brine, rinse lightly and allow to dry on paper towels for 1 hour. Place meat strips on the smoker racks and dry for 12 hours, using your favorite fuel. When strips are the dryness you like, allow to cool and transfer into a ziplock bag for taking on trips, hiking, camping, etc. Posted to recipelu-digest by "Christopher E.

    </ingredient>

      <li>Recipes from San Francisco Chronicle: SOUTH TO NORTH -- `Everything' Salsa Adds Zing to, Well, Everything Jacqueline Higuera McMahan The ideal salsa should be able to adorn many things besides tortilla chips. This summer, while playing around in the kitchen with luscious tomatoes from a nearby farm stand, I discovered the perfect Everything Salsa. It's made with wonderful summer tomatoes, spiked with New Mexico and chipotle chiles, sweetened with red onion, and smoothed with cream. Best of all, the recipe makes a full quart and keeps well, refrigerated, for up to a week. (You can also freeze it, in one-cup measures, for several months.) That means you've got plenty for those chips -- but much more, too. You can brush Everything Salsa onto chicken breasts or pork tenderloins that are grilling on the barbecue -- just omit the cream if you're using it on the grill -- or use it to lace vegetables for tacos. It's even nice on pasta, if -- like me -- you think salsa goes with just about anything. Everything Salsa is best, however, in Stacked Enchiladas -- one of the easiest and fastest enchilada recipes I know. It's great for a quick summer meal and it, too, can be made ahead. INSTRUCTIONS: Rinse and stem the chiles, then place in a large pot. Add the tomatoes, onion, garlic, oregano, water and salt. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to very, very low. Simmer for 30 minutes. Place half of the solid ingredients in a blender. Add about 1 cup of the liquid (do not use all of the liquid or the sauce will be too thin). Process until the ingredients are pureed. Push the puree through a fine sieve into a large saucepan. Use a spatula to scrape off all bits of puree from the bottom of the sieve. fRepeat with the remaining solids and 1 more cup or so of the liquid. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, tasting for seasoning. Add the half-and-half and continue to simmer for 5 minutes, until the sauce smooths out and the flavors come together. Yields about 1 quart salsa. PER TABLESPOON: 10 calories, 0 g protein, 2 g carbohydrate, 0 g fat (0 g saturated), 0 mg cholesterol, 69 mg sodium, 0 g fiber.

      <li>Source: Gloria Pitzer's Secret Recipes (pamphlet) Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine cake mix, eggs + water, oil and cocoa powder. Blend well until you can form it into a ball. Let stand 20 minutes. Form dough into 1/2-inch balls placed 2 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet Flatten each ball with bottom of a greased once drinking glass that has been dipped in Nestle's Quik powder to deepen the color of the cookies to resemble the originals. Bake 8 minutes. Immediately out of the oven, flatten each cookie with the back of a pancake turner. Let cool 20 minutes while you prepare the filling. The filling: Soften the gelatin in 1/4 C cold water and place in a pan of hot water until clear. Meanwhile, beat the Crisco until fluffy, adding the powdered sugar a little at a time. Add the vanilla and cooled gelatin and beat 6 minutes. Shape into 1-inch balls and place between the bottom sides of two cookies, pressing them gently but firmly together until the filling becomes nicely rounded at the edges. Chill about one hour to set the filling. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest Volume 98 #020 by fancymom@juno.com (Frances Kahn) on Jan 10, 1998</li>

      <li>One of our favorite quick (but incredibly messy) meals is "fried" brown rice. I find I like it even better than the fried white rice I get at Chinese restaurants. We had this last night: In a LARGE non-stick skillet, saute the ginger, garlic, onion, mushrooms and any other veggies that need pre-cooking for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Dry off the bottom of the skillet, return to heat (oops, I forgot the heat setting -- medium high does really well) and add rice. Dry fry it for a while, until some of it turns golden brown. Then add back the cooked veggies, the green onions and peas. Sprinkle with soy sauce to taste and mix all well. Heat thoroughly. Enjoy! Then spend the rest of the week getting rice granules out of your stove.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Bake according to manufacturer's instructions. Author's notes: "Semolina flour has a very high gluten content, and therefore makes an exceptional loaf. Expect a yellow-tinted interior and a well-developed wheat flavor." My notes: I made this bread 6/3/96. I used durum wheat flour instead of semolina. Barney unplugged my machine, so I had to finish the second rise, and bake it in the real oven. It turned out great. This bread is not sweet, it has almost a "sour" taste. Holds up nice for sandwiches. I'll make it again. Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 14:49:42 -0400 From: Sleopo@aol.com MM-Recipes Digest V3 #166 From the MealMaster recipe list.

      <li>From: Wendy Lockman &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt; Date: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 18:40:49 -0400 Mix the milk and yogurt together in a glass, pottery or plastic container.(NOT metal) Keep a lid on it, but don't seal it. (sealed starters have been known to explode!) Put this where the temperature will be 80-90F for about 24 hours. Then add the flour and put it back in the warm place for 3-5 days. Stir it daily. It will bubble and have the odor of fermentation. It's ready to use. A starter is a live thing and must be fed. When you use it you should replace what you used. The amount you should replace will vary according to need. If you use your starter often or you know you are going to have a heavy demand soon, then you can put several cups of milk and flour (equal measures) in it. Generally though you should put in either 1/2 C to 1 C of both flour and milk. I prefer to use buttermilk, as it gives the starter a much stronger sour taste. If you are not going to use the starter for awhile, place it in the refrigerator. It needs to be fed once a week...just a few spoons flour or milk. If you forget and leave it in there for a long time without food, don't just throw it out. Try first to bring it back by adding 1/2c of flour and milk and leave out for a day or so. It is remarkable how these things come back. MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #50 From the MasterCook recipe list.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Mix all ingredients. Author's Notes: Here is the all-purpose southwestern favorite. This simple salsa is unbeatable when tomatoes are at their brilliant best. If time permits, refigerate the salsa for two or three hours before serving, so that flavors of the individual ingredients "marry". Serve it with any of the tortilla dishes, grilled chicken or hamburger, or tortilla chips." From "Betty Crocker's Southwest Cooking". My notes: I made this 6/3/96. Was pretty haphazard about measuring &lt;g&gt;. Turned out GREAT! Even better next day! Next time, lighter on the cilantro, more lime, and MORE GARLIC!!! ......mmmmm....

Davenport &lt;cdavenpo@PigsEye.Kennesaw.EDU&gt; This is the recipe I have and my directions don't specify what goes where either. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Sift flour and sugar, set aside. In a saucepan, bring the margarine, cocoa and water to a boil; remove from heat. In a large bowl, mix all remaining cake ingredients. Add the flour mixture and cocoa mixture, stirring well. Bake in a greased and floured 9x13" pan for 20 to 30 min. Check for doneness with a clean toothpick. Ten minutes into the baking of the cake, prepare the frosting. Place the margarine, cocoa, and milk in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the remaining ingredients. Beat until smooth. FROST THE CAKE AS SOON AS IT COME OUT OF THE OVEN. Let it cool a little before cutting, if you can't possible hold out!. This cake is so good, you'd eat it with one foot in the fire if you had to.

      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
      <li>1 2/3 cups Sugar</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>: Hand beat egg whites until somewhat frothy. Combine flour, sugar and salt and add to egg whites; beat until smooth, losing grainy look. Add vanilla. Beat again. Add cream and stir until well blended. Have ready a baking dish, Pyrex or deep metal pan (milk pan) lined with a short pastry which has been chilled in refrigerator for some time. Pour cream mixture into crust and bake in a very slow oven, 250 ~275 degrees F., for 4 hours. It must not boil. Best done the day before and allowed to set. : This cream pie, a fifth or sixth generation recipe, has a custard like texture and a delicious flavor. A. K. (Binx) Gardner had the recipe from Mrs. Obadiah Gardner, his mother, who had it from her mother and grandmother. The pie is cooked in a very slow oven for 4 hours and allowed to set for at least another day before it is served. This is a large pie. A small "sliver" of the pie makes a good dessert.

      <li>Take a can of juice-packed peaches or pineapple. Freeze it for several hours. (That's right, just put the can in the freezer!) Open and dump frozen contents into food processor with metal chopping blade in place or into a blender. Process until desired consistency. Enjoy! Note: You can also do this with frozen bananas. I find this is a good way to use them this time of year when they get over-ripe so quickly. Freeze them* in "zip-lock" type bags - peeling them when frozen can give you frostbite! They end up very creamy--like very rich ice cream...but with no added fat,sugar, etc... *w/o peels From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <category>Low-fat</category>
    <quantity>12</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sesame Oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Whole yellow mustard seed</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves; crushed</li>
      <li>1 small Shallot (optional) finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Low salt tamari</li>
      <li>1 Thai pepper; finely chopped (or jalapeno, italian, or what have you) -OR- Tabasco)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Tomato juice or V8</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons White pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Arrowroot; -OR- Corn starch)</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Well, this is NOT non-fat, but is low fat. It's kind of a Schezuan sauce I guess, of my own invention. If I could figure out how to avoid using the oil it would be non-fat, but anything I've tried has been less than yummy. Considering it makes about 1 1/2 cups of sauce, and that goes a long way (ie: 2 Tbs per serving, approx), the fat content per serving should be about 1g due to the sauce. The flavor of the sesame oil is quite indespensible, to me. It's quite spicy, be warned! But it's fantastic for vegetables over rice, or with vegetables, grilled chicken, and rice noodles; or stirred into plain wild rice. Experiment! DIRECTIONS: =========== In a small skillet, saute the garlic, hot pepper, shallot, and mustard seed in the oil until the garlic and shallots brown and the mustard seeds begin to pop (best over high heat, but don't let the oil burn). Add the tomato juice, tamari, white pepper and cumin. Lower heat and simmer 5 mins. In a smal cup mix 2 tsp cold water and the arrowroot until smooth. Stir into sauce, stirring constantly. The sauce should thicken in about a minute or two. Remove from heat and stir into your favorite dish.

    <title>"I Can't Believe This Is a Passover Cake" Yellow Cake</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>8 large Eggs; warmed</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Matzoh cake meal</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Potato starch; not packed</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Passover vanilla sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon or orange zest; finely minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Melted; unsalted Passover margarine or oil</li>
      <li>Extra Potato Starch for Dusting</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Technically, this recipe is a cross between a true sponge cake, a classic genoise and a chiffon cake. I like it because I do not have to separate the egg whites and yet I get a well- textured cake. It is an exceedingly MOIST cake that keep well and is a good foundation for fresh fruit, pareve, Passover mousse, or a chocolate ganache topping. Although the eggs are not separated you must treat them with care. Another must is a good, stationary, electric stationary mixer (e.g. such as a Kitchenaid, Rival or Sunbeam) with a whisk or whip attachment that will properly mount the warmed, whole eggs. "Are you sure this is a Passover cake" is the reaction most people have on their first bite of this flavorful cake. For people who loathe dry cakes and think Passover cakes are suspect at best, this is a must. A good cake to have if someone in your family has a birthday during Passover. Preheat oven to 350 F. Generously grease a ten inch springform pan or a 9 by 13 inch rectangular pan. Dust with potato starch and line bottom with parchment paper, cut to fit. Warm eggs (still in shells - do not open) by placing in a bowl and covering with very hot water for 1-2 minutes (water should be hot but not so hot as to crack eggs open and cook them but hot enough to warm them up. Do not leave eggs in water longer than 1-2 minutes). This is the most important step. Do not omit it. Heat mixing bowl by filling with very hot water and then dry completely. Meanwhile, sift together cake meal and potato starch. Place lemon juice and melted margarine in a small bowl together. Set these ingredients aside. Break warmed eggs into mixing bowl of an electric mixer along with sugar, vanilla sugar, salt, and citrus zest. Using whip attachment, beat on low speed just very briefly just to combine ingredients. Then increase to high speed for 12 minutes. Batter will be extremely voluminous. Pour batter into a very large mixing bowl. In a smaller bowl, stir together the potato starch/matzoh cake meal mixture, combining well. Then fold this mixture into egg batter, folding gently to combine but taking care not to deflate the mixture unduly (some deflation is impossible to avoid). Gently drizzle and fold in lemon juice and melted margarine or oil. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 30-35 minutes until cake is set in centre or until cake seems just firm when lightly touched. Cool well before removing. Note: This is not a high cake (anywhere from 1 1/2 inches to 2 1/2 inches high) but it is very flavorful and moist.

To make the Irish coffee syrup, put the coffee and sugar into a small pan and bring up to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Then boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and add the whiskey. . Wash and dry the pan the cake was baked in, and return the cooled cake to it: then pour the hot coffee syrup all over it. Leave in a cool place for several hours, then turn out. Whip the cream until it's thick, sweeten slightly with confectioners' sugar, and add whiskey to taste. Spread the cake with the whipped cream and chill for an hour before sprinkling with chopped nuts or grated chocolate. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>2 cups Water</li>
      <li>2 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Instant coffee; fresh jar</li>
      <li>1/2 Vanilla bean; chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Vodka</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: OPTIONAL FLAVORINGS</li>
      <li>1 pinch Cinnamon; ground</li>
      <li>1 pinch Cloves; ground</li>
      <li>1 pinch Cardamom; ground</li>
      <li>1 pinch Orange peel; grated</li>
      <li>1 pinch Mint; dried flakes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Boil water &amp; sugar together until dissolved &amp; clear. Turn off heat. Slowly add instant coffee &amp; continue stirring. When well mixed let cool to room temperature. While the coffee mixture cools, add vanilla bean to the vodka. When the coffee mixture is cooled add to the vodka mixture. Cover tightly &amp; shake vigorously each day for 3 weeks. Strain &amp; filter. Yield: About 4 cups Dona &amp; Mel have this to say about Kahlua: The Mexican "Kahlua" &amp; Jamaican "Tia Maria" are probably the best known coffee flavored liqueurs. Other companies produce similar drinks called Moka, Mocha, Creme de Mocha, &amp; so forth. Coffee is among the easiest flavors to simulate. We recieved many recipes from our friends that varied only slightly from one another. It seemed that everyone had made a version of "Kahlua" at one time &amp; treasured his own recipe. VARIATION: Substitute rum for the vodka to yeild a simulated "Tia Maria". Substitute brandy for the vodka for another simulated "Kahlua". Formatted by cea260@airmail.net Christopher E. Eaves Chris' Notes: I like to use the vodka version with a pinch of cardamom. Experimenting with this recipe I have found that instead of throwing out a partial pot of coffee, save it in a tightly covered container in the fridge until you get 2 cups worth. Then use it in place of the water &amp; delete the instant coffee. (Very FRUGAL considering the price of good coffee these days!)

    <ingredient>
      <li>Graham crackers; (or saltine crackers) to cover a 15" x 10" jelly roll pan in a single layer (cut to fit at one end and along one side)</li>
      <li>1 cup Brown sugar; (light or dark)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Butter or margarine</li>
      <li>2 cups Chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 cup Chopped walnuts or pecans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Heat oven to 350 F. Lightly but thoroughly grease bottom and sides of jelly roll pan (some versions of the recipe specify lining the pan with foil and also greasing the foil). Line pan with crackers to cover completely in a single layer. Stir butter and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat until butter has melted, sugar is dissolved, and mixture is blended and thickened slightly (no longer than 3 minutes!). Pour hot mixture over crackers, spreading to cover them completely. Bake 8 minutes (no longer!). Remove from oven. Wait a few seconds for topping to stop bubbling, and then sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over surface. When the chips have melted, spread the chocolate evenly over the crackers (now one giant piece!). Sprinkle chopped nuts over all. When chocolate has set, cut cookies: Make three lengthwise cuts and five crosswise cuts to make twenty-four 2 1/2 inch squares. Cut squares on the diagonal to make 48 triangular cookies. Per cookie (with graham base) 100 cal, 1 g pro, 11 g car, 6 g fat, 5 mg chol with butter, 45 mg sodium. These are delicious. And no one ever guesses how easy they are.

      <li>Date: Thu, 29 Feb 96 11:55:49 EST submitted by: bgoodman@umd5.umd.edu I have been subscribing to this mailing list for a while and I have a few recipes I want to share. I have been watching my fat intake and in the interest of keeping flavor in food, I have come up with some easy recipes (for one or more) that are very healthy. Use one bowl per person. Tear up lettuce and fill the bowl about 2/3 with the lettuce. Julienne the cucumber and put a small handful of cucumber on top of the lettuce. Cut up the green onion and cilantro (leaves only) and sprinkle on top to taste. Cook the noodles as directed on the package. Drain and put on top of the raw vegetables. Regarding the meat. If I use chicken I cook it in some water and a tablespoon of hoisin sauce. I cook until just done so that it is tender. If you are not trying to stay as low fat as possible, you could cook it in a little oil. If I am using shrimp, I steam the shrimp, and peel them. Place the meat on top of the noodles. If the meat is shrimp, I add a tablespoon of hoisin sauce now, if chicken, I just put it on top. Put a serving of carrot pickles on top. Serve like this. (Very colorful) Each diner can stir up his/her own bowl. I mix well to blend the flavors. Some people may want to keep the foods a little separated. One reason I like this dish so much is that it is a nice blend of cool crispy foods and warm hearty foods. I purposely left many of the measurements out so that you can experiment and add more of what you like, and use less of what you don't. I used tofu once instead of meat, and I didn't really like it, but if you like tofu, try it and let me know what you think.

      <li>Date: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 12:08:26 -0500 From: pickell@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell) Cut chicken into 1-1/2 x 1/2 inch strips. In bowl, blend soy sauce and hoisin sauces, water, orange juice concentrate, peanut butter, chili paste and sesame oil until smooth. Stir in cornstarch. Add chicken and stir to coat; marinate for 15 minutes. Cover mushrooms with warm water; soak for 15 to 50 minutes or until softened. Drain and rinse; discard stems and slice caps into thin strips. Meanwhile, break noodles into 1-1/2 inch long pieces. Place in bowl and cover with water; soak for 5 minutes, then drain. In saucepan of boiling water, cook noodles for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water; drain well. In wok or skillet, heat peanut oil over med-high heat; cook ginger, garlic and onions for 30 seconds. Add red pepper and mushrooms; cook for 3 minutes. Add chicken with marinade; cook for 3 to 4 minutes or just until chicken is no longer pink inside. Stir in noodles and coriander; let cool. Dip rice papers, one at a time, into warm water to soften; lay out on damp tea towels in a single layer. Place about 2 Tbsp filling in centre of each triangular sheet (or 1/4 cup in each round sheet). Fold up bottom over filling; fold sides over and roll up tightly. (Rolls can be covered with damp tea towel in separate layers and refrig- erated for up to 8 hours) In wok or Dutch oven, heat oil over med-high heat to 375F. Fry rolls, in batches, for about 5 minutes or until crisp and golden on all sides. Drain on rack. Makes 16 large or 30 small rolls. Instead of deep-frying, steam spring rolls in greased steamer for 5 minutes, or bake for 20 minutes in 400 degree oven. Assembled spring rolls can also be eaten without being cooked.

Keep blending with a spoon until a paste if formed. 2. Heat the oil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat and add the paste. Reduce the heat immediately to low and stir steadily and vigorously, scraping the bottom of the saucepan to make sure the spices do not stick or burn. (Don't put your face ovr the pan, as the pungent vapors from the spices will make your eyes water.) 3. Stir constantly for about 8 minutes, or until the spices have cooked and mellowed and the oil is exuded from the mixture to the edges of the pan. Set aside to cool. 4. When the mixture has cooled, spoon it into a jar, complete with any oil, and cap tightly. The paste will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator and, if the jar has been sterilized, will keep for at least 6 months on the shelf. Use 1 TB to every 1.5 pounds of meat (more if you like it spicy). CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #097 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>Date: Sat, 24 Feb 1996 15:55:15 +1300 (NZDT) To: gghosey@internext.com From: D &lt;ddingle@ihug.co.nz&gt; Hi Glen..... Anyway, I thought you might be interested in a couple of my favourite Indian recipes I have used for quite some time. They were part of an Indian cookery course a friend attended. Neither recipe is particularly hot as far as the ingredients go - but they taste pretty damned good and you can always adjust the heat to your own liking: 1. Cut meat into pieces. Soak in yoghurt, salt, crushed garlic, ginger and 1 onion for about 1 hour 2. Slice the second onion. Heat the butter. Add onion and crushed poppy seeds. Cook for a couple of minutes and then remove from heat. Add all the remaining spices. Return to the heat, mix well and add meat and marinade. 3. cook over medium to low heat until the meat is cooked and yoghurt almost dried up. 4. NB You can leave it as a gravy curry by cooking on a low heat to prevent yoghurt from drying up... 5. NB Mustard oil works well for this dish. 6. if you prefer a less dry dish, add a can of tinned tomatoes and cook until meat is tender or put in a suitable covered dish the oven at about 180 c for 90 mins or so.

    <title>Vietnamese Chili Sauce (Dip)</title>
    <category>Vietnamese</category>
    <category>Condiment</category>
    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>2 Dried red chilies</li>
      <li>2 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Lemon juice</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Mince chilies and garlic finely and place in a mortar. Mash with the heel of a cleaver or pestle. Add sugar and stir until it dissolves. Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between each addition. This makes enough for 2 to 4 people. I almost always double the recipe just to make sure there's enough. I've kept it for long periods of time but unless you freeze it, it's past it's prime after a few days. This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip for chicken or whatever. Variations of this are found in Cambodia, Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. You can fiddle with it endlessly. This is a good starting point. The proportions shown here produce what I consider a mildly warm dip. I generally use two to six times as many chilies, depending on their strength and how hot I want it. Variations: use green serrano chilies instead of dried red ones, lime juice instead of the lemon juice or palm sugar instead of granulated. If you make it in a food processor, don't over process. It should have small chunks of each ingredient rather than being a homogeneous liquid. The taste is sour and hot, very puckery. It's great with poached or steamed chicken, duck or game hens. Much better with basically bland dishes rather than something like curry which has it's own blend of spices. Good with Chinese white-cut chicken or Steamed Ginger Chicken with Black Bean sauce. It's truly addictive and I often serve it with meals that are not Oriental in origin. Should be good with a firm- fleshed white fish or boiled shrimp or crab. Fish sauce is a liquid made with anchovies and salt. It's not really fishy tasting. Look for it in the oriental section of supermarkets or at markets catering to Asian clientele. Tiparos is a good brand made in the Philippines. I prefer Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce, but they'll probably be harder to find. Chinese fish sauce is NOT a substitute.

    <recipetext>
      <li>A few years ago my adult son and I went into a food fair in Sydney Australia. At an Indian stand he asked the waiter. What he Vindaloo was? The answer cameback ******* hot mate! We tasted it and it was!! Ever since then anything hot has been called "Vinaloo Mate" "My chille is Vindaloo Buba" Here is a recipe from my Indian Cookbook. Put the Ginger,garlic, chille powder, turmeric, salt, cardamom, cloves peppercorns,cinnamon,coriander, cummin seeds and vinegar into a blender and blend to a pur‚e. Scrape down the sides of the blender and blend for a further 30seconds. Add more vinegar if necessary to form a smooth liquid paste. Put the pork in a large bowl and pour over the spice paste. Cover and set aside to marinate for 1 hour. Lay the curry leaves if you are using them, on top. Re-cover and put the bowl into the refrigerator for 24 hours, turning the meat 2 or 3 times during the period. Two hours before cooking time, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and set aside. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the mustard seeds and cover the pan. Fry the seeds until they pop, then add the pork, marinade and water. Bring to the boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer for a further 30 minutes or until the pork is cooked through and tender. Transfer the Vindaloo to a warmed serving dish and serve at once. 4 to 6 servings. Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #294 by Tony Flynn &lt;flynnaj@xtra.co.nz&gt; on Apr 15, 1997</li>

    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's scanned recipe number two++another recipe for a perennial favorite, Cha gio or Vietnamese Spring Rolls. I haven't tried this one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her stuff is usually bang-on. In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes. Rinse tree ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers. Coarsely chop and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch lengths; set aside. Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper. Add tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your hands. Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce: Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated carrot. Makes 1/2 cup. To form spring rolls: Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow pan (such as a cake pan). Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel. Let sit until it wrinkles and softens to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer. Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long. Place the log along the bottom third of the wrapper. Roll the bottom edge over the log, then roll it over the filling once more. Make sure the wrapper is taut around the filling. Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to enclose the ends. Roll up to seal. If there is a tear in the wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant. Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover with a damp towel. Continue making the remaining rolls. To deep fry rolls: Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat fry fryer. Heat to 325F. Add a few rolls at a time. Do not crowd. Fry for 10 seconds. Immediately increase heat to high (375F). Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove rolls to paper towels to drain. Serving suggestions: Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces . Dip into sauce and enjoy as an appetizer. Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of coriander and mint. Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part of a multi course meal. NOTE: If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate them overnight, wrapped in plastic. Don't keep them longer than 1 day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and frozen for up to 2 months. To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet and bake at 350F for 10 minutes. Makes 16 rolls. PER ROLL: 175 calories, 5 g protein, 18 g carbohydrate, 8 g fat (3g saturated), 1 mg cholesterol, 90 mg sodium, I g fiber. Joyce Jue, San Francisco Chronicle, 9/2/92.

      <li>1 pound Ground pork butt</li>
      <li>4 Garlic cloves finely minced or pureed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fish sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Fresh finely ground pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup Flaked crab meat</li>
      <li>1 cup Grated carrot</li>
      <li>1 cup Bean sprouts; tails removed</li>
      <li>4 Shallots; minced -=OR=- Onion</li>
      <li>2 cups Warm water</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Sugar</li>
      <li>16 12" rice paper wrappers (dried)</li>
      <li>Peanut oil for deep-frying</li>
      <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>Fresh mint</li>
      <li>Fresh coriander leaves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>IN SEPARATE MEDIUM BOWLS, soak the mung bean noodles and tree-ear mushrooms with water until soft and pliable. Drain the noodles and cut into shorter lengths; set aside. Remove the hard centers from the mushrooms, coarsely chop and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the pork, garlic, fish sauce and ground pepper. Mix in crab meat, tree-ear mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, shallots and bean thread noodles; set aside. Combine the warm water and sugar in a bowl. Lay 1 rice paper wrapper on a damp towel. (Keep unused wrappers in their package.) Generously brush it with the sugar water; allow it to soften to a very pliable wrapper, about 30 seconds or sometime longer (depending upon the brand). With your hands shape 3 tablespoons filling into a tight compact 1-inch-wide-by-4-to-5-inch-long cylinder. Place cylinder along the lower edge of wrapper. Roll the bottom up and over the roll tightly. Fold both outside edges inward to enclose the ends. Continue rolling up into a cylinder; set aside covered with plastic wrap. Repeat until all the rolls are done. To cook and brown evenly, the roll must be firm and evenly packed. If the wrapper has a tear, bandage it with a softened rice-paper remnant. In a preheated wok or saucepan, add oil to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 325F. Add a few rolls at a time, but do not crowd. Fry for 10 seconds. Immediately increase to high heat or 375F. Fry, turning occasionally until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towel. Cut crosswise into 1+1/2-inch pieces. Arrange rolls on a plate lined with lettuce. On another plate, arrange leaves of lettuce, fresh coriander and mint leaves. To eat, wrap spring-roll garnish with sprig of coriander and mint leaves in a lettuce leaf and dip into nuoc cham sauce (See RECIPE).

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Preheat oven to hot (400°F). Use bread that is very dry -- 2 or 3 days old. Cut 3 slices of bread, 3/4 inch thick. Trim crusts and cut across diagonally to make 6 triangles. In a bowl, beat eggs until light and frothy. Add cream, salt and nutmeg. Soak bread, a few pieces at a time so they absorb egg-cream mixture thoroughly. In skillet, heat 1/4 cup cooking oil. Fry bread on both sides until golden. Remove bread and drain on paper towel to absorb any grease. Place on baking sheet and allow to puff up in the hot oven for 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with sugar; serve with maple syrup. Serves 2. Posted to recipelu-digest by "Crane C. Walden" &lt;cranew@foothill.net&gt; on Feb 7, 1998</li>

      <li>1/2 cups Lemongrass, about 4 stalks minced **</li>
      <li>3 Scallion; all of them</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Peanut oil</li>

      <li>Coriander leaves; chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Hack the chicken into small serving pieces, chopping through the bones with a very sharp cleaver. Remove the outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely slice the tender white part at the base of the stalks. Bruise with a mortar and pestle or the handle of a cleaver. Finely slice the scallions, including the green tops. Mix the chicken with the salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the lemongrass and scallions and set aside for 30 minutes. Heat a wok and add the oil, and when the oil is hot add the chicken mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add chile peppers and stir-fry on medium heat for 10 minutes or until chicken no longer looks pink. Season with sugar and pepper and add the chicken stock. Stir for a few minutes. Garnish with the peanuts, "nuoc mam" and coriander. Serve with rice, if desired. This quickly prepared but terrifically flavorful dish is great served with rice paper wrappers. I love it with a few leaves of mint and basil. This is one you must try. It is easily done in a wok.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>In restaurants and cafe, dark-roast coffee is brewed in an individual drip pot that sits on top of a glass, slowly dripping into sweet milk. it takes a good 10 to 15 minutes for the water to finish dripping through, and the coffee is sipped at an equally leisurely pace. Both the coffee and the pots are available in Southeast Asian markets, but any type of coffee and any brew- method that produces a strong, rich-tasting cup will do. Place the milk in the bottom of an 8 ounce glass. Carefully pour in coffee, trying not to disturb the layer of milk. Stir milk up from bottom and sip coffee. There will probably be some milk left in the bottom of the glass when you are finished. Makes 1 serving. Variation: This coffee may also be served iced. Add ice cubes on top of the sweet milk and proceed as above. From the California Culinary Academy's "Southeast Asian Cooking", Jay Harlow, published by the Chevron Chemical Company, 1987.

      <li>"Vinegar is a preservative &amp; therefore the vindaloo may be kept in the refrigerator for several days before using. In fact, the flavour are intensified if the vindaloo is eaten one or two days before cooking, warm slightly. ... The vindaloo requires that a substantial amount of oil be used in the preparation. For our purpose &amp; without compromising the flavor, I have suggested that the excess oil be poured off before dining. Toasting &amp; grinding the whole spice seeds is the old-time method &amp; very effective in deriving the most flavor. However, I have also lightly toasted ground spices, which is an improvement over using them directly from the container. The recipe is one prepared by the Bhatia Christians of Calcutta, a group of Anglo-Indians who have intermarried with Bengali Indians." Lightly toast the coriander, poppy, mustard seeds, &amp; cumin seeds in a dry skillet for 2 or 3 minutes until the aroma is released. Grind the seeds in a processor to a fine powder. Set aside. Heat the oil in a pan &amp; add all the toasted dry spices, the chili flakes ginger and garlic. Stir fry over moderately low heat for 2 min. Add the meat &amp; stir continuously for 10 minutes as the meat browns. Add the water, cover the pan &amp; cook until the meats are tender, about 1 hour. When the meats have been fully tenderized, add the vinegar &amp; continue to cook until the vinegar evaporates &amp; the oil has risen. This is an indication that the vindaloo is ready. At this stage, all the oil may be poured off before serving. Serve warm with plain white rice &amp; masoor dal.

Soak bean threads in cold water to cover 20 to 30 minutes. Cook in 2 quarts boiling water until al dente, about 1 minute. Transfer to colander and rinse with cold water, drain well. Blanch carrots in boiling noodle water 1 minute. Rinse in cold water. Blanch, drain and rinse snow peas and bean sprouts the same way (blanch bean sprouts for 30 seconds). Fill a large shallow bowl with cold water. Soak a sheet of rice paper for 1 minute. Carefully (very carefully!) transfer to a dry paper towel, and let sit 1 to 2 minutes until pliable. To assemble rolls, arrange 2 mint leaves in a row along the bottom third of the rice paper. Arrange 1/12 of noodles, mushrooms, carrots, scallions, cucumber and snow peas in a row on top. Roll up rice paper, folding in flaps after first turn. Add one basil leaf after first turn. This forms a compact roll about 6 inches long. Once assembled, they will keep for 6 hours, covered in refrigerator. To serve, cut in half on the diagonal. Makes 12 rolls. Digest eat-lf.v096.n085 From the EAT-LF recipe list.

      <li>(This is for "Thai Iced Coffee: Make *very* strong coffee (50-100% more coffee to water than usual), use something like Cafe Du Monde which has chicory in it. Pour 6-8 oz into cup and add about 1 Tbs sweetened condensed milk. Stir, then pour over ice.) Make even stronger coffee, preferably in a Vietnamese coffee maker. (This is a metal cylinder with tiny holes in the bottom and a perforated disc that fits into it; you put coffee in the bottom of the cylinder, place the disc atop it, then fill with boiling water and a very rich infusion of coffee drips slowly from the bottom.) If you are using a Vietnamese coffee maker, put two tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk in the bottom of a cup and put the coffee maker on top of the cup. If you are making espresso or cafe filtre (the infusion method where you press the plunger down through the grounds after several minutes of infusion), mix the sweetened condensed milk and the coffee any way you like. When the milk is dissolved in the coffee (yes, dissolved *is* the right word here!), pour the combination over ice and sip. REC.FOOD.RECIPES From rec.food.cooking archives.

      <li>My mother-in-law is Icelandic and this is a recipe that was passed down from her grandmother. Whenever she has friends visiting from Iceland she serves then this and they comment on how much it reminds then of their youth. Although the calls for ground prunes (I try to forget this when I eat the cake) you can substitute your favourite jam. When you slice the cake it is very pretty seeing all the layers. Cream butter or margarine, add sugar gradually, add eggs one at a time. Add milk and flavoring. Sift dry ingredients, and add to the above mixture. Need in enough flour to make a soft "cookie" dough. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour Roll thin and bake in layered cake pan for appox 10 min (350 deg f) Tip: Roll the dough on the bottom of cake pan and put directly in the oven. Filling: Remove stones from prunes and grind the prunes. Combine with water and sugar. Boil mixture, being careful to stir frequently. You only boil this mixture for 5-7 minutes. Cool the mixture. To assemble, Spread one layer with prune filling, add second layer and continue until all layers are used. You should have 6-7 layers. Notes: If you want to put on an icing you can. Also, if you don';t want to use prunes you can substitute jam. Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 Apr 97 by Graham Jones (519)451-2500 Ext 2956 Fax: 519-452-6156 on Apr 11, 1997</li>

      <li>20 Cloves garlic</li>
      <li>7 Jalapeno peppers</li>
      <li>2 Ribs celery</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Paprika</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon Whole cumin seed</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's a salsa recipe I've been playing around with for about a month or so. Originally, I wanted to "wrap" a salsa around a core of nuoc cham, with a hint of a Cajun hot sauce thrown in for good measure. The end result was a bit of a hybrid, but it seems to have worked out fairly well. Anyway, enjoy--it's a hot one! Peel (if necessary) and coarsely chop the tomatoes. Place in a saucepan. Add coarsely chopped onion, celery, and jalapenos. Peel and finely dice the garlic, add half now and reserve the other half. Grind the cumin seed and add it along with the nuoc mam, vinegar, worcestershire, paprika, ground red pepper, and three tablespoons of sugar. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce to a moderate simmer, and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until desired thickness is achieved. Now, about 5 minutes before the salsa is done, fry the reserved garlic in a little oil until it is crispy and golden. Remove the salsa from heat, add the fried garlic with one tablespoon of sugar, and stir occasionally until the salsa cools (stops steaming). This should keep for between 1 and 2 weeks at 40 degrees F. The recipe makes between 1.5 and 2 quarts of salsa. ~--Tom NOTES : Mastercook formatted by Garry Howard, Cambridge, MA garhow@hpubmaa.esr.hp.com or garhow@aol.com Recipe by: EAT-L - Tom Solomon SOLOMON@ALISON.SBC.EDU</li>

      <li>8 Cloves garlic peeled</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons Turmeric</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Grind cumin seeds, red chilies, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, black mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds in a coffee-grinder or other spice grinder. Put the ground spices in a bowl. Add the vinegar, salt and sugar. Mix and set aside. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy pot over a medium flame. Put in the onions. Fry, stirring frequently, until the onions turn brown and crisp. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and put them into the container of an electric blender or food processor. (Turn off the heat.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of water to the blender and puree the onions. Add this puree to the ground spices in the bowl. (This is the vindaloo paste. It may be made ahead of time and frozen.) Dry off the meat cubes with a paper towel and remove large pieces of fat, if any. Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend until you have a smooth paste. Heat the oil remaining in the pot once again over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the pork cubes, a few at a time, and brown them lightly on all sides. Remove each batch with a slotted spoon and keep in a bowl. Do all the pork this way. Now put the ginger-garlic paste into the same pot. Turn down the heat to medium. Stir the paste for a few seconds. Add the coriander and turmeric. Stir for another few seconds. Add the meat, any juices that may have accumulated as well as the vindaloo paste and the water. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer gently for an hour or until port is tender. Stir a few times during this cooking period. Serve with rice. From the TWSU BBS, 316-689-3779, C. Burdsal, SYSOP File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmindian.zip</li>

      <li>This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine, the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form. All these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92. Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread, each of which balances these assertive flavors. Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and Tabasco or cayenne. Form into patties and grill until cooked through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro. Makes 4 servings.

      <li>Soak bone overnight in cold water. Place bones, oxtails and flank steak in a large stock pot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook 10 minutes, drain and rinse pot and bones. Return bones to pot, add 6 quarts water and bring to a boil. Skim surface of scum and fat. Stir bones at bottom from time to time. Add 3 more quarts water, bring to a boil again and skim scum. Lower heat and let simmer. Char clove-studded onions, shallots, and ginger under a broiler until they release their fragrant odors. Tie charred vegetables, star anise, and cinnamon stick in a thick, dampened cheesecloth. Put it in stock with parsnips and salt. Simmer for 1 hour. Remove flank steak and continue simmering broth, uncovered pot, for 4-5 hours. Add more water if level goes below bones. Meanwhile, slice beef sirloin against grain into paper-thin slices, about 2-by-2 inches. Slice flank steak the same way. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine scallions, cilantro, and half the sliced onions. Place remaining onions in another bowl and mix in hot chili sauce. Soak rice noodles in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside. When broth is ready, discard bones. Strain broth through a colander lined with a double layer of damp cheesecloth into a clean pot. Add fish sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. In another pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add noodles and drain immediately. Do not overcook noodles. Divide among 4 large soup bowls. Top noodles with sliced meats. Bring broth to a rolling boil, then ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with scallions mixture and black pepper. Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and remaining ingredients on the side to add as desired. Also, you can add Hoisin sauce as a dip. Serves 4.

    <quantity>4</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1/3 pounds Rice vermicelli or somen noodles</li>
      <li>1 Dried red chile pepper, coarsely chopped, OR</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Red-pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons Rice-wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Fish sauce</li>
      <li>2 large Carrots</li>
      <li>1 large Cucumber, peeled if waxy</li>
      <li>1/2 Head Chinese cabbage, leaves separated &amp; coarsely chopped (about 4 C)</li>
      <li>1/2 Head Boston lettuce, coarsely chopped (about 2 C)</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Bean sprouts</li>
      <li>2 Whole boneless and skinless chicken breasts (4 halves)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Canola or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt &amp; freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Fresh mint leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Lightly salted roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. Soak vermicelli, if using, in a bowl of cold water for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine chopped chile pepper or red-pepper flakes, sugar, lime juice, 2 T of the vinegar, and fish sauce. Stir well to dissolve sugar. Set aside. 2. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drain vermicelli and add to boiling water; cook for 2 minutes. If using somen, add dry noodles to boiling water and cook for 3 minutes. Drain noodles and transfer to a bowl of cold water. Set aside. 3. Peel carrots and, using a sharp zester, cut into long, thin threads. Use a vegetable peeler to "peel" entire cucumber into long, thin strips. Cut strips lengthwise into thinner strips, about 1/4 inch wide. 4. Combine carrots, cucumber, cabbage, lettuce, and bean sprouts in a mixing bowl and toss with remaining vinegar. Set aside. 5. Remove tenderloin (meat attached to underside of breast) from chicken breasts; save for another use. Place breasts between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer or cleaver, pound breasts 1/4 inch thick. 6. Heat grill or grill pan and brush with oil. Season chickcn on both sides with salt and pepper, and grill until cooked through and juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from grill and allow to sit for 1 to 2 minutes. 7. Drain noodles well. Divide salad mixture among 4 plates. Top each with a quarter of the noodles. Slice chicken breasts lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick strips and place on salads. Set out fish-sauce mixture, mint and cilantro leaves, and chopped peanuts in separate bowls, for dressing and garnishing individual salads.

He published two leather bound cookbooks that we received as a gift and the following is from one of the volumes. I can't think of a better way to utilize leftover turkey... Thanks Lindy for this wonderful submission to The Kountry Kitchen. I only have one of the volumes from this wonderful actor and gourmet cook. Now that I know there were two... I'll be looking!

Arrange 4 shrimp halves on lettuce. Top with 1 tablespoon each of green onions and cucumber. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon mint over filling. Fold sides of spring-roll sheet over ends of filling. Starting at filled side, roll into cylinder. Place on plate. Repeat with remaining spring-roll sheets, lettuce, shrimp, green onions, cucumber and mint. Serve with sauce.

      <li>1/4 cups Fresh roasted coffee beans</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 Vanilla bean; split in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: VIENNESE WALNUT PUDDING</li>
      <li>Butter and sugar; for custard cups</li>
      <li>4 ounces Semisweet chocolate; coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dark rum</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Instant coffee granules</li>
      <li>1 cup Plain dried bread crumbs</li>

      <li>5 tablespoons Unsalted butter; softened</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 large Egg yolks plus 4 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: CHOCOLATE GLAZE</li>
      <li>8 ounces Semisweet chocolate; finely chopped</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Plus 3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Light corn syrup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: HALF-DIPPED WALNUTS</li>
      <li>6 Walnut halves</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>YIELD: 6 servings DIFFICULTY: ** PREPARATION: 1 hour plus chilling and baking times. Allow the coffee-vanilla cream to chill for at least 6 hours or overnight. Make the coffee-vanilla cream: 1.In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, coffee beans, sugar and vanilla bean. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stop stirring and bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Pour the hot cream mixture into a small noncorrosive bowl. Let the mixture cool for 15 minutes. 2.Cover the surface of the cream mixture with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Make the Viennese walnut pudding: 1.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter and sugar six 6-ounce custard cups. Put the cups in a high-sided roasting pan large enough to hold them easily. 2.Melt the chocolate with the rum, water and coffee according the melting instructions given in the Chocolate Melting Tips. Whisk gently until smooth and let the melted chocolate mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes, until tepid. 3.In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine the bread crumbs, walnuts and salt. Process for 10 to 20 seconds until the nuts are finely ground. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl. 4.In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium speed, beat the butter and confectioners' sugar for 1 to 2 minutes, until creamy. Beat in the vanilla. One at a time, beat in the egg yolks, beating well after each addition. Add the melted chocolate mixture and beat until smooth. 5.In a large grease-free bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer and clean beaters, beat the egg whites at low speed until frothy. Gradually increase the speed to high and beat the whites until soft peaks start to form. One teaspoon at a time, gradually add the granulated sugar and continue beating the whites until stiff, shiny peaks form. 6.Using a rubber spatula, fold one third of the whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whites with the bread crumb/ walnut mixture. 7.Divide the pudding equally among the prepared cups. Remove one of the corner cups from the roasting pan. Hold a metal pancake spatula vertically inside that corner of the roasting pan and slowly pour the water against the spatula into the roasting pan. (The spatula will prevent the water from splashing the other cups.) Pour in enough water to come one-half of the way up the sides of the cups. Replace the cup in the roasting pan. 8.Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of each pudding comes out clean. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and leave the puddings in the water bath to keep warm while preparing the chocolate glaze. continued in part 2</li>

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Beet should be washed and dried. If you are using a fresh beet, preheat the oven to 375 Degrees F. Wrap the beet in aluminum foil and bake until tender, about 1 1/4 hours. When the beet is cool enough to handle, peel it and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 10 minutes. Add the carrots and cook until the vegetables are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes more. Let cool until easy to handle, then cut the vegetables into 1/2-inch dice. In a large salad bowl, combine the potatoes, carrots, onion, pickles, peas, beet, scallions, and dill. Season with salt and pepper and toss gently, taking care not to crush the vegetables. In a small bowl, whisk the dry mustard, sugar and vinegar together. Whisk in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss the salad with the dressing and tasting to correct the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. Makes 4 generous servings. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>

      <li>Here they are! The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls. Yields 80 spring rolls. Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters. Place the cut rice paper on a flat surface. With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over the entire surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on several wrappers at a time. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold the sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll. After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan, put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate, and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown. (This is Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp). To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows: Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc cham. Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce, 2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices. Each person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using chopsticks or a fork. Additional carrot salad may be added to taste. Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham. NOTE: We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps them crisper than frying in any other oil. From "The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam", Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman, Barron's, 1979.

      <li>Make the chocolate glaze: 1.Put the chocolate in a 1-quart measuring cup with a pouring spout. In a small saucepan, set over medium heat, heat the cream and corn syrup, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture comes to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds, to melt the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Stir in the vanilla. Half dip the walnuts and glaze the puddings: 1.One at a time, half dip the walnuts in the warm chocolate glaze and set them on a plate. 2.Unmold the puddings and place them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Pour the warm glaze over the tops of the pudding, letting it spill over the sides. Lift the puddings with a metal spatula and set them on individual dessert plates. Decorate the puddings: 1.Strain the chilled coffee-vanilla cream into a large bowl. Discard the coffee beans and the vanilla pods. Using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed, beat the cream for 1 to 3 minutes, until it starts to form stiff peaks. 2.Fill a pastry bag fitted with a closed star tip (such as Ateco #3) with the whipped coffee-vanilla cream. Pipe a shell border around the base of each pudding. Pipe a swirled rosette on top of each pudding. Garnish each rosette with a half-dipped walnut. These puddings are best when served while still warm. Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #188 by docden &lt;docden@mnl.v-link.net&gt; on Aug 15, 1997</li>

      <li>~Beverly has known the Cuccia's for years. Vicki graciously gave her the recipe. It's an all day soup, slow simmer, it needs skimming. You could substitute meaty bones. Beef base is sold retail at quantity grocers and membership stores. This recipe does not use instant barley. ~ Put bones in soup kettle and cover with water. Bring to boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer for 4 hours. Skim foam as it appears. Add tabasco, beef base, salt and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. ~ Strain broth and scrape any meat from bones. Put strained broth and bits of meat into pot. Add onions, carrots, celery, potatoes and barley. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer about 1 hour or until barley is cooked. Add tomato paste and simmer another 15 minutes. (Press Enterprise - 9 May 1996)</li>

    <ingredient>
      <li>Ingredient Group:</li>
      <li>3 pounds Frying chicken</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Lemongrass; about 4 stalks, minced **</li>
      <li>3 Scallion; all of them</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Peanut oil</li>
      <li>2 Red chile peppers; chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Chicken stock; fresh / can'd</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Black pepper; freshly ground</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>Ingredient Group: GARNISH</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Dry-roasted peanuts; chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Nuoc Mam **</li>
      <li>Coriander leaves; chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Hack the chicken into small serving pieces, chopping through the bones with a very sharp cleaver. Remove the outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely slice the tender white part at the base of the stalks. Bruise with a mortar and pestle or the handle of a cleaver. Finely slice the scallions, including the green tops. Mix the chicken with the salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the lemongrass and scallions and set aside for 30 minutes. Heat a wok and add the oil, and when the oil is hot add the chicken mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add chile peppers and stir-fry on medium heat for 10 minutes or until chicken no longer looks pink. Season with sugar and pepper and add the chicken stock. Stir for a few minutes. Garnish with the peanuts, "nuoc mam" and coriander. Serve with rice, if desired. This quickly prepared but terrifically flavorful dish is great served with rice paper wrappers. I love it with a few leaves of mint and basil. This is one you must try. It is easily done in a wok.

    <category>Ceideburg 2</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 cup Minced fresh pineapple</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Mam nem (anchovy sauce)</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>1 Fresh red chili pepper, seeded</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Rice vinegar or distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>For anchovy lovers, here are a couple of variations for a Vietnamese dipping sauce made with 'em. This is traditionally served with Beef Fondue with Vinegar (Bo Nhung Giam) that is part of the Vietnamese feast called Bo Bay Mon (Beef in seven ways++seven distinct ways of preparing beef). It's good with other stuff too but can be a bit strong to Western tastes. Some restaurants have it but you might have to ask for it. This is by far the most intricate of sauces in the Vietnamese culinary repertoire. What makes it so special is the use of a condiment called mam nem, prepared from ground fresh anchovies and salt and fermented over a period of time. It can become dangerously addictive. Traditionally, mam nem is served as a dipping sauce for barbecued or fried fish. In general it goes well with grilled foods. It is an essential sauce fro Beef Fondue with Vinegar. Use only fresh pineapple and remember to shake the bottle of anchovy sauce thoroughly before using. Anchovy cream may be substituted. Over a bowl, squeeze the pineapple between your hands to extract as much juice as possible. Combine the pulp and juice and set aside. Into a bowl, strain the anchovy sauce through a very fine sieve, pressing on th solids with a spoon to extract all of the liquid. Discard the solids. Pound or crush the garlic, chile and sugar to a fine paste in a bowl. Stir in the pineapple mixture, strained anchovy sauce, lemon juice, vinegar an fish sauce. Stir to blend. Yield: 1 1/3 cups VARIATION: If you are unable to find mam nem sauce, here is a variation of the above recipe, using canned anchovies. Add pineapple, if desired. 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 fresh red chili pepper, seeded 2 tablespoons sugar 2 cans (2 ounces each) flat anchovies, drained 1/4 cup nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons pineapple or water Combine the garlic, chile and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound to a fine paste. Add the anchovies and mash to a very smooth paste. Stir in the fish sauce, lemon juice and pineapple juice. Mix well. Yield: about 1 cup. From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier.

Put the chicken pieces in a bowl, add the fresh lemon grass or the drained soaked dried lemon grass (save the soaking liquid). Peel and crush the large garlic clove, peel the ginger and grate it finely. Add the garlic, ginger, sugar, tomato paste, salt, chilli powder and turmeric to the chicken. Mix, cover and set aside for 1-24 hours, refrigerating if necessary. Peel and finely chop the two garlic cloves. Put the oil in a wok or large, lidded frying pan and set over a high heat. When it is hot, put in the garlic. Stir and fry for 30 secs or until the garlic is golden. Add the chicken along with its marinade. Stir and fry for 5-6 mins or until the chicken browns a little. Add the fish sauce and either the lemon grass soaking liquid or 4 tb stock. Stir once and cover. Cook on a high heat for 5 mins. Lift the lid and stir, adding another 4 tb of stock. Cover, turn the heat to low and cook for another 5 mins. While the chicken cooks, peel the onions and cut them into 0.75" dice. Separate the onion layers within the diced pieces. Turn the heat under the chicken to high, remove the wok lid, add the onion and fry for 1 minute. Lift the chicken out its oiul and serve.

      <li>2 cups Coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 cup Milk or water *</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* If you use canned coconut milk, you must use water. This is a real Vietnamese curry. Although adapted from the Indian, which is always made with white potatoes, the Vietnamese version has the option of using white or sweet potatoes, the latter being greatly favored by the Vietnamese. The Indian in- fluence is greatest in the South, where curried dishes are more popular than elsewhere in Vietnam. This is usually served with noodles as a party dish. When it is part of a family meal, it is eaten with rice. Bach serves this to her children for breakfast, when it is served with French bread--another influence on the cuisine of Vietnam. If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and upper two-thirds of the stalks, then cut the remainder into 2-inch lengths. If you are, using, it must be soaked in warm water for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine. Combine the curry powder, black pepper, sugar, add salt and marinate the chicken in the mixture for at least 1 hour. Heat the oil and fry the potatoes over high heat until brown. (It is not necessary to completely cook potatoes at this point, only to brown them.) When well browned, remove from the pan and set aside until ready to cook the curry. Pour off most of the oil from the pan, leaving 2 tablespoons for cooking the chicken. Heat 2 tablespoons oil over a high flame. Fry the garlic for a few seconds, then add the bay leaves, onion, and lemon grass; stir briefly and add the marinated chicken, stirring long enough to sear the meat slightly. Add the 2 cups of water and carrot, then cover and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 5 minutes; uncover and stir, then cook, covered, for another 10 minutes. Remove the cover and add the prefried potatoes, the coconut milk, and the milk. Cover again and simmer another 15 minutes. Serve with rice, Rice Sticks, or Japanese Alimentary Paste Noodles.

      <li>2 cups Pineapple juice</li>

      <li>2 cups Diced fresh or canned crushed pineapple</li>
      <li>1 Bottle of ginger ale; (1-2 liter)</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>&gt;From: gyspylady &lt;reenee430@uswest.net&gt; This truly is the best baked boneless ham I have ever eaten. Its from the Villa Montana, Morelia, Mexico and is in the Cotton Country Cookbook of Monroe, LA. Stud ham with cloves. In blender container (or food processor if no blender), place the sugar, pineapple juice, crushed pineapple, and mustard. Blend but do not puree. Place ham on rack in roasting pan. Pour pineapple mixture over ham. Bake for one hour at 350 degrees. Lower heat to 300 d. and bake for 2 hours. As juice in pan boils down (check after first hour), begin to add ginger ale as needed. Baste ham every 15 minutes for last hour, adding ginger ale as needed. This is the secret to the wonderful flavor! For the last 30 minutes of cooking, remove rack and place ham in bottom of pan.

      <li>submitted by: tpogue@ids2.idsonline.com A yummy stew - falls apart on the fork, easy to make and tender as they come - also better the next day. We had it two nights ago. We love it! Original main ingredient was veal, but I found veal dried out too fast so substituted the stewing meat. We have something called cross-cut blade steak here, which I use and it's perfect! - Use your equiivalent tender beef. Preheat oven to 325. Tossed cubed beef in flour. (I put the whole mess into a plastic bag) Brown in olive oil/butter. Place in a casserole dish. Toss mushrooms in pan until lightly cooked and add to casserole with combined meat stock and mustard. Stir. Scrape pan and add to casserole. Add salt and pepper. Place tied herbs on top of meat Cover and cook for two hours, stirring once during cooking. Remove herbs before serving.

      <li>SERVES 8-10 This dish comes from a cookbook that is about 200 years old. I cannot quite figure out the background of the name but we have seen the dish many times since those early days. It is obviously a way of stretching meat using rice. I have added some seasoning and the dish is baked, so it is easy to prepare. Mix all together and form into 1-inch balls. Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes at 375ø, or until they are done to your taste. If you make these small enough, they are terrific as party snacks. Larger sizes fit the dinner table well, along with a green salad, rolls, and perhaps some Cabbage and Salt Pork (see recipe). From &lt;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&gt;.

    <recipetext>
      <li>Here's a recipe that goes way back in my family. I can't cite a source, but it's likely my father brought it back with him after he spent time in Korea. These are great appetizers, but we eat them as our main dish sometimes too. Hot and spicy, but you can reduce the seasoning for a little less intensity and they'll still taste good. In summer you can barbeque them but they're just as good in winter done in a hot frying pan over high heat. Cut meat across grain in very thin slices. If longer than 3 inches, cut in half. Place in bowl with rest of ingredients and mix well. Cover and refrigerate overnight (or longer for spicier flavor; must be at least 4 hours). Place meat on rack over barbeque (high heat), one minute each side. Should be brown, not crusty. Or heat large fry pan, toss in meat and cook over high heat two minutes, stirring occasionally.

      <li>1/4 cups Plus one tablespoon nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Plus 1 teaspoon potato starch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>

      <li>4 Garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Oriental sesame oil</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil, for shaping meatballs</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>A few weeks back there was some discussion of a Vietnamese meat ball soup that you had in a restaurant. This is a recipe for beef meat balls that may be close to what you had. Actually this seems to be more like a pate from the preparation. I'm also posting a recipe for a Vietnamese pork pate that's delicious as well as a recipe for grilled dried beef. These crunchy little beef balls are very popular among the Vietnamese. They are served mainly as appetizers or added to noodle soups. Chili sauce (tuong ot) is the usual accompaniment, but any hot red pepper sauce can be served alongside. [Tuong ot is a paste made by smashing up hot red chilies and garlic. The Philippine "Sambal Oelek" or Thai Sriracha are good substitutes. S.C.] In a shallow dish, mix the fish sauce, potato starch, baking powder, sugar and black pepper. Slice the meat into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Add to the marinade and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. Before proceeding, transfer the meat to the freezer for 30 minutes. Work with half of the beef at a time; do not overload the work bowl. In a food processor, combine half of the beef with half of the garlic and sesame oil. Process to a completely smooth but stiff paste, about 3 minutes. Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the work bowl. The completed paste should spring back to the touch. Transfer the paste to a bowl. Process the remaining beef, garlic and sesame oil the same way. Rub some vegetable oil on one hand. Grab a handful of the meat paste and close your hand into a fist, squeezing out a small portion of the mixture, about 1 teaspoon, between your thumb and index finger. Keep rolling and squeezing the same portion between your thumb and index finger until you obtain a smooth rounded ball. Scoop out the meatball with an oiled spoon. Repeat until all of the paste is used. Pour 1 inch of water into a wok or wide pot. Place a steamer rack or bamboo steamer over the water. Arrange the meatballs without crowding in a single layer on the rack. Cover and steam for 5 minutes. Serve as an appetizer with chili sauce. These beef balls can also be added to a well-seasoned beef broth, sprinkled with chopped scallions and black pepper and served as a soup (noodles may be added). NOTE: These meatballs may be frozen. Thaw them thoroughly, then steam or simmer in boiling water until just heated through. Yield: about 60 meatballs. From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori, 1989.

Warm brandy in small pan over low heat, ignite and pour over beef mixture, lifting pan from heat and shaking until flame dies. Continue cooking for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; add 1 cup diced pineapple, orange segments and mandarine liquer, stirring carefully to mix. Fill pineapple shells (barrels) with beef and fruit mixture. Place filled fruit upright in foil lined pan. Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees F.) for 35 minutes. Meanwhile remove stemms from mushrooms, slightly hollowing out caps. Cook caps in butter in small frying-pan about 3 minutes. Curl up each pimiento strip and place in mushroom cap. To serve, set both "Barrels" on warm plater, spoon beef mixture over rice on individual dinner plates and garnish each serving with 3 stuffed mushroom caps.

    <title>Beef Barley Soup</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 tablespoon Clarified butter; unsalted</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
      <li>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>2 pounds Beef shoulder; cut in 1/2" pieces</li>
      <li>2 small Yellow onions; peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>8 cups Beef stock; more if needed</li>
      <li>1 Boquet garni: rosemary; thyme, bay leaf</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Pearl barley</li>
      <li>3 Carrots; peeled, 1/2" pieces</li>
      <li>3 Parsnips; peeled, 1/2" pieces</li>
      <li>1 pound Mixed mushrooms*; cut in 1" pieces</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>* Such as cultivated white, cremini, yellowfoot, chanterelle, hedgehog, or black trumpet 1. Heat butter and oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season beef with salt and pepper. Sear meat in two batches on all sides until well browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add onions and cook, stirring constantly, until well caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. 2. Return meat to pot, and add stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour. Add bouquet garni, barley, and vegetables, and simmer for 1 hour, adding more stock if necessary. Adjust seasonings. NOTES : The addition of exotic mushrooms to flavorful homemade beef stock turn a familiar favorite--beef barley soup--into a special winter meal. Serve with crusty bread, a robust red wine, and a salad, and you'll have a deliciously comforting meal . Cultivated white button mushrooms are the type commonly found in most supermarkets. However, wild mushrooms such as the ones used in this soup, are increasingly available. Look for cremini or Italian brown mushrooms, which look like a darker version of the white variety, but are light tan with an earthier flavor. Black trumpet mushrooms are trumpet-shaped, as the name implies, and mildly fragrant. The yellowfoot is a golden, trumpet-shaped variety. Pumpkin-colored chanterelles possess a delicate, nutty flavor. The oddly named hedgehog mushroom get its name from the tiny spines under its cap.

    <ingredient>
      <li>1 pound Top round steak; cut into 1.5 inch chunks</li>
      <li>1 medium Spanish or vidalia onions; quartered and separated</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Salad or olive oil</li>

      <li>1 medium Straight-neck squash</li>
      <li>1 medium Red or green pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Medium mushrooms</li>
      <li>1/2 pounds Cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Italian dressing</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>1. In a medium sized bowl, mix the first 7 ingredients. Cover mixture and refrigerate at least 2 house, stirring occasionally. 2. About 1 hour before serving, prepare the grill for barbecuing. 3. Cut zucchini and yellow squash into 1 inch chunks. Cut pepper into 1 inch pieces. On long skewers, alternately thread zucchini, yellow squash, peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. (I usually use only one tomato and 1 mushroom per skewer to keep the weight down.) On separate skewers, alternately thread beef and onions. Save the marinade for later. 4. Place vegetable and meat skewers on grill over medium heat. If you have a 2-level grill, place the meat skewers on the lower level and the vegetable skewers on the top level. Cook about 10 minutes, brushing the meat and onions with the reserved marinade and the vegetables with the Italian dressing. Turn skewers several times while brushing frequently.( A good way to tell that the vegetables are done is when the tomatoes start to split.) This is a great meal served with curried (or regular) rice and a fresh fruit salad.

Place in crockpot. Strain marinade reserving vegetables. Add marinade to meat. Saute vegetables until glazed and add to meat. Loosen pan drippings with a little water and add to pot along with bouillon and tomato sauce. Cover and cook on low 8 hours or until tender. Transfer meat to carving board. Pour juices into saucepan.

In 2-quart saucepan, saute chopped onions in 1 tsp. olive oil until golden. Carefully stir in mil, then stir in cornmeal, 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Heat polenta mixture to boiling over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reudce heat to low, cover, and cook without stirring for 5 minutes. In small bowl, lightly beat egg. Gradually stir a little of the hot polenta into the gg; then stir the egg-and-polenta mixture into the pot of polenta. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Pour polenta into greased pan. Spread to make surface level. Cool to room temperature on wire rack. Cover and refrigerate until firm--several hours or overhight. Three hours before serving, prepare beef filling: Heat oven to 350øF. In large skillet, heat remaining oil. Saute beef cubes, half at a time, until well browned on all sides. Remove beef cubes to 1 1/2-quart casserole or souffle dish as browned. In same skillet, saute remaining 6 onion, the mushrooms, and garlic until golden. Remove to casserole and toss with beef. Carefully add 1 cup water to skillet; heat to boiling. In cup or small bowl, stir together remaining 1/2 cup water, the flour, mustard, the remaining 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Stir into boiling water in skillet to make sauce. Cook, stirring to loosen browned-on bits, until thickened. Stir in olives and capers. Pour sauce over beef mixture in casserole. Cover and bake 1 1/2 hours. With sharp knife, cut polenta into 4 1/2-inch squares; cut squares diagonally in half to make 8 triangles. Remove lid from casserole; arrange polenta triangles, spoke-fashion, on top of beef mixture. Sprinkle with cheeses. Bake casserole, uncovered, 30 minutes longer or until beef is tender and polenta triangles are browned on edges. Serve from casserole.

    <recipetext>
      <li>This recipe is an excellent use for leftover beef. Though there are several variations possible for a Miroton (mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic), the predominate flavor is always onions, which are made into a sharp sauce. Preferably, the leftover beef will be from a pot-au-few that has been tenderized by long poaching, but roast beef can work as well. It will just need more baking time. The following is my favorite variation for a Miroton: Make sure the beef is chilled for easy slicing. Then, slice as thinly as possible. Set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter and lightly saute the onions. When golden and very soft, about 10 minutes, sprinkle them with enough flour to make a light roux. Stir the mixture thoroughly for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the vinegar and mustard. Continue stirring, adding enough stock or Pot-au-Feu broth to make a thin sauce. Add the spices. Bring the sauce to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 30 minutes. Assembly: Pour a layer of sauce into a shallow baking dish. Layer meat slices, always overlapping, alternating with more of the sauce. You should end up with a final layer of sauce. Bake, covered, in a 350 degree oven for half an hour, if meat was originally poached, or for an hour, if roast beef. Check to make sure sauce does not reduce too much. Add more stock if necessary. When preliminary cooking is finished, sprinkle surface of dish with a thick coating of fresh bread crumbs. Spoon just enough butter over crumbs to moisten them. Return to oven for about 30 more minutes, or until a golden crust forms. Sprinkle the top with the parsley to garnish, and squeeze over it the juice of half a lemon. Serve at once. Variations: Add tomatoes, garlic, and/or mushrooms. Instead of vinegar, use a little grated horseradish. In place of some of the stock, use wine. This dish is very flexible. It is also economical, but it doesn't taste like it! File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip</li>

The URL of the site is http://www.epicurious.com Bon Appetit, July 1995, from Clark's Outpost Barbecue, Tioga, Texas. Canned chipotle chilies are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets. Saute beef and 2 cups chopped onions in large Dutch oven over high heat until beef is cooked through, stirring often and breaking up beef with back of spoon, about 10 minutes. Add cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and chipotle chilies; saute 3 minutes. Mix in 2 1/2 cups water and 1/2 cup cilantro. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover partially and cook 1 1/2 hours, adding more water by 1/4 cupfuls if chili becomes dry. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to simmer before continuing.) Mix remaining 1/2 cup cilantro into chili. Ladle chili into bowls. Serve, passing cheese, sour cream and additional chopped onion separately. 4 Servings CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #294 From the Chile-Heads recipe list.

      <li>Tips: This is an excellent casserole for children and teenagers. Adults love it too! Substitute ground chicken or veal for beef. It's great to reheat. Make ahead: Prepare up to a day ahead but do not bake until ready to eat. In large nonstick skillet, heat oil; saute garlic and onions for 4 minutes. Add beef and saute until no longer pink, approximately 4 minutes. Add stock and tomato sauce; simmer on low heat for 12 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Set aside. Cook pasta in boiling water according to package instructions or until firm to the bite. Drain and place in baking dish. In medium nonstick saucepan, melt margarine, add flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add stock and milk; simmer on medium heat until slightly thickened, approximately 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese. Add tomato sauce mixture to pasta. Mix well. Pour cheese sauce over top. Cover and bake for 15 minutes or until hot. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

      <li>Trimmed 4 1/2 to 5 pound beef tenderloin roast; (about 16 inches long and 3 inches diameter)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large Egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Water</li>
      <li>1 package Store bought frozen puff pastry; thawed</li>
      <li>Coriander walnut filling; recipe follows</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim tenderloin if necessary and pat dry. Halve tenderloin crosswise and season with salt and pepper. In a large heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until just smoking and brown beef, 1 piece at a time, on all sides, about 2 minutes total for each piece of beef, transferring to a platter. Make an egg wash by lightly beating egg with water. On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out pastry into a 19 by 15-inch rectangle (slightly less than 1/4-inch thick). Cut a 1-inch strip of dough from a shorter end (leaving an 18 by 15-inch rectangle) and reserve strip. Arrange rectangle lengthwise on a baking sheet or tray (about 17 1/2 by 12 1/2-inches), letting excess hang over. Spread one third filling lengthwise down middle of rectangle, forming a 16 by 2-inch strip. Arrange beef pieces end to end lengthwise on filling and spread remaining filling on top of beef. Brush edges of dough with some egg wash. Fold up long sides of dough to enclose beef completely and seal edge. Fold ends of dough over wrapped beef and seal edges. Invert a large baking sheet onto wrapped beef and invert beef onto sheet so that pastry is seam side down. Brush crust evenly with some egg wash. Cut out holly leaves and berries from reserved pastry strip and arrange on crust, gently pressing to make them adhere. Brush decorations with some egg wash and with a sharp knife make small steam vents every 3 inches on top of crest. Chill beef en croute, loosely covered, at least 1 hour and up to 6. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake beef en croute in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and a thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center of beef registers 115 degrees. Let beef stand on sheet on a rack 25 minutes. Beef will continue to cook as it stands, reaching 125 degrees (medium rare).

      <li>2 teaspoons Light soy sauce</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>*Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION: Slice flank steak across the grain in thin strips no more than 1/8 inch thick. Mix with meat marinade for 1/2 hour. String and cut green beans in 1 1/2 inch length. Cut green onions the same length. Combine sauce mixture. Separate store bought rice noodles so they will not stick to each other. If you make your own noodles, cut them in 1/2 inch wide strips and separate them. COOKING: Stir fry green beans in 1 tbsp. oil for 3-4 minutes, adding 2 tbsp. water the last 2 minutes and cover. Set aside. Add 1 tbsp. oil and brown the garlic and ginger. Stir fry beef, drizzle 1 tbsp. of oyster sauce on top. Set aside. Add 2 tbsp. oil and stir fry noodles, turning and adding a little water so they'll soften. It takes about 3-4 minutes. You may find you have to add more water or oil to keep a steady stream of steam to help soften the noodles. Add back the vegetables and meat. Add the rest of the oyster sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil. DO AHEAD NOTES: Do through preparation. COMMENTS: Rice noodles can be purchased in Chinatown by the pound. They come in sheets or pre cut. You can easily make your own rice noodles. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for MM by Karen Adler FNGP13B.

      <li>Ground black pepper; to taste</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Combine chilies and 1 1/2 cups chicken stock in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring twice, or until chilies are soft. Cool slightly. Pour into a blender. Add tortillas and puree until smooth. Chili mixture should be quite thick, with just enough liquid to puree. You may need to add a bit of additional stock. Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When oil smokes, add beef cubes and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until just brown. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and set aside. While oil is still hot, stir in onion and cook for 5 minutes or until well browned. When brown, add garlic and cumin and cook for 1 minute. Add chili puree and fry for about 7 minutes or until thick and very dark, stirring often to keep from scorching. When thick, add meat, beer, and 4 cups chicken stock, stirring well. Lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until very thick and reduced by half. Remove from heat and stir in the cinnamon and cilantro bundle. Let stand, without stirring, for 15 minutes. Remove cinnamon and cilantro and stir in lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.

    <ingredient>
      <li>4 pounds Boneless beef brisket; well-trimmed; 4 to 5 lb</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Catsup</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Vinegar</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Liquid smoke</li>
      <li>1 Bay leaf; crumbled</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons Pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Rub meat with salt. Place in ungreased baking dish (13x9x2). Stir together remaining ingredients and pour over meat. Cover tightly with foil and bake in slow oven (325 degrees) for 3 hours or until tender. Open foil during the last 45 minutes to allow it to brown a bit. Mary Ann's note: I think the liquid smoke adds that Texan authenticity that distinguishes this from the ordinary - and the long slow cooking.

      <li>Although this recipe calls for beef you can substitute any other meat or vegetable. Put the rice and four times it's volume of stock/water into a thick bottomed pan. Add the star anise, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper and half the spring onions. Bring to the boil then simmer, stirring occaisionally, until the rice turns into a thick glop - about 40 minutes. Add more water if needed. Remove and discard the spring onion and add the beef. Cook for two minutes. Add the beans and cook for a further two minutes. Chop the remaing spring onions and add, along with a dash of the sesame oil. Goes very well with chinese chilli sauce and/or soy sauce.

      <li>Preheat a charcoal grill to high or an oven broiler to 500 degrees. If wooden skewers are used, soak them in cold water until ready to use. Cut the beef into 1 inch cubes. There should be 24 cubes. Peel and cut the onions into 24 1 inch cubes. Reserve the remaining onion for another use. Set the cubes aside until ready to cook. Cut away and discard the pepper cores and seeds. Cut the peppers into 24 equal-size pieces and set aside until ready to cook. Combine the meat and remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl. Blend well and marinate for 15 minutes. Drain the meat and arrange equal portions of meat, onions and peppers on skewers. Reserve the marinade for basting.

Make sure to get some juice in the buritto. Heat oven to 350 degrees and bake 10 minutes. This is the trick because the juice soaks into the buritto. I have also used pork and chicken in these and they are great, but make sure to use chicken with skin so it isn't dry. I have also substituted salsa verde for the tomatoes when using the pork for an easy chili verde burrito.

      <li>Date: Mon, 25 Mar 96 13:05:40 EST submitted by: reep@datanet.ab.ca From cookbook "Let's Go Dutch Again" by Johanna Bates and Jan Walrabenstein. In a large saucepan, place the meat, carrot, parsley and water. Bring to a boil. Once the mixture is boiling reduce the heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, heat the margarine in a Dutch oven. Add the flour, salt and spices and stir until you have a roux. Heat and stir for 2 more minutes and then let the roux cool down. Once the meat mixture is done, reheat the roux and stir in the meat mixture gradually. Stir vigorously and bring to a low boil. Once all the meat mixture is added, maintain a low boil for 15 minutes. Spread the meat mixture on cookie sheets with sides no higher than1/2". Brush with a bit of melted butter to prevent a crust from forming. Cool overnight in the refreigerator. The next day, make cylindrical shapes (croquettes) or smallish balls (bitter balls) from the stiff mixture. Roll the cylinders through the breadcrumbs, then through the egg whites and again through the breadcrumbs, then freeze. Place the frozen croquettes in preheated oil and deep-fry about 5 minutes or until they are golden brown. ( I have deep-fryed them ahead of time and reheated in the oven. This avoids the smell when you have a house full of guests). Yield: approximately 30 croquettes Can be servied with Dutch-style coarse mustard.

    <recipetext>
      <li>If you are using fresh galingal, peel and coursely chop it and set it aside. If you are using dried galingal, combine it in a cut with 4 tablespoons of water. If you are using fresh lemon grass, cut of the straw-like top, leaving about 6" of the bottom. lightly crush the very bottom and set it aside. If you are using dried lemon grass, put it into the water along with the galingal. Crumble and break the dried red chillies and cinnamon into enough water to cobver and add them to the dried galingal and dried lemon grass if you are using them. Also put in the cloves. Soak the spices for 30 mins. Cut the red pepper coarsely inot dice, discarding all the seeds. Peel and coarsely chop the shallots/onions, ginger and garlic. In an electric blender, combine the soaked spices and their liquid, the frsh galingal (if you are using it), the chopped red pepper, shallots, ginger and garlic. Blend until smooth. Into a wide, preferably non-stick pan put the paste from the blender, the fresh lemon grass (if using), the curry leaves and kaffir lime leaves (or lemon rind). Stir the coconut milk well until smooth and pour that in as well. Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat to medium and cook the sauce for 15 mins, stirring now and then to prevent curdling. Put in the meat and salt and bring to the boil again. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook, uncovered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to medium-high and continue to cook, stirring now and then for a further 30 mins or until the sauce becomes thick and brown and the meat tender. This is now called KALIYO DAGING, if you continue to cook until the sauce dissappears its called RENDANG DAGING.</li>

      <li>1/4 cups Torn cilantro leaves; for garnish</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Place 1/4 cup flour, salt, pepper to taste and beef in a plastic food bag. Seal the bag and shake to coat the beef. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium high heat. When hot, sear the beef on all sides, about 2 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet. Add shallots, garlic, ginger, curry powder and apple, and cook, stirring often, until the shallots are softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons flour, sugar, cumin and turmeric, and cook 1 minute. Stir in broth, currants and tomato paste, and simmer, uncovered, until the mixture has the consistency of sour cream, about 10 minutes. Add water as needed if the sauce is too thick. Add beef and accumulated juices to the sauce. (Curry can be prepared to this point and refrigerated up to 2 days or frozen as long as 1 month. Bring to room temperature before reheating. Gently reheat until just heated through but not long enough to cook beef further if rare is preferred. Add water as needed.) Taste and adjust seasonings. Garnish with cilantro. Serve with assorted chutneys. NOTES : Can substitute lamb, chicken, turkey or shrimp for the beef with excellent results. Hot, fragrant basmati rice is a perfect backdrop for the spicy curry.

      <li>3 pounds Round roast; trimmed</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Safflower oil</li>
      <li>2 cups Yellow onion; finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Garlic; minced</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Ground chili powder; preferable freshly ground from dried ancho or pasilla peppers</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Unbleached flour</li>

      <li>3 cups Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>4 cups Cooked pinto beans</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Quickly rinse the beef under running cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Chop the beef with a sharp knife or food processor, or cut it into 1/2-inch cubes. Reserve. Heat the oil in a dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the beef and garlic and cook until the meat is just past the pink stage. Add the chili powder, cumin, flour, and salt, black pepper, and cayenne to taste; mix well. Stir in the tomato sauce, reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, until the flavors are well-blended, about 1 hour. Stir in the cooked beans, if using, the last 20 minutes of cooking. Add a little water to the pot anytime during the cooking if the mixture begins to dry out. Serves 12. NOTES : "This easy yet tasty version comes from my sister Martha, who wraps it in warm tortillas with an array of toppings (grated jack cheese, chopped red onion, chopped tomato, chopped cilantro, shredded lettuce, salsa).

      <li>1 Bottle dry red wine;such as</li>
      <li>Zinfandel or Burgundy (750 ml)</li>
      <li>1/3 cups Salt pork; minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Flour</li>
      <li>1 cup ;water</li>
      <li>2 ounces Dried shiitake mushrooms broken into 2 or 3 pieces other left whole</li>
      <li>12 ounces Small pasta; such as seashells or orecchiette</li>
      <li>1 cup Parmesan cheese; freshly grated</li>
      <li>Parsley; chopped</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>INSTRUCTIONS: Cut the chuck into 2 to 2-1/2-inch cubes. Trim off any large pieces of fat. If using shanks, cut the meat from the bone in pieces as large as possible. Place the meat in a large nonreactive bowl. Quarter 1 of the onions and add to the meat along with the carrots, thyme, bay leaves, rosemary, half of the salt and half of the pepper, 2 garlic cloves and the orange peel. Pour the wine over all and turn to mix and immerse the ingredients. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator overnight, or at least 4 hours. To cook, put the salt pork in a heavy-bottomed casserole large enough to hold all ingredients. Cook over medium-low heat until the pork releases its fat, about 5 minutes. Discard the crisped bits of pork. Dice the remaining onion and mince the remaining garlic cloves. Add to the pot and saute until translucent. Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside. Drain the meat (reserve the marinade) and pat it as, dry as possible. Add a few pieces of meat to the casserole (do not crowd) and saute about 5 minutes, turning once or twice. The meat will darken, but will not truly "brown." Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set aside. Continue until all the meat has been sauteed. Add the flour to the casserole and cook it until it browns, stirring often. Increase the heat to high, and slowly pour in the reserved marinade. Deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits clinging to the bottom. Return the onions, garlic, meat and its juices to the pan. Add the remaining salt and pepper, the water and the mushrooms and bring to a near-boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight fitting lid, and simmer for 2-1/2 to 3 hours, or until the meat can be cut with a spoon and the liquid has thickened. Remove from the heat. Discard the carrots, herb branches and the onion quarters. Skim off some, but not all of, the fat (some is necessary to coat the pasta). Prepare the pasta according to package directions; drain well. Transfer the pasta to a serving dish and ladle the sauce from the daube over it, adding more salt and pepper, if desired. Top with 1/4 cup of the freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the parsley. Serve the daube directly from its casserole. Pass additional cheese at the table. Serves 6 to 8.

      <li>3 tablespoons Mixed herbs (optional - rosemary; basil, oregano, thyme)</li>
      <li>4 Cloves garlic; chopped coarsely</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Coarsely ground pepper</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>Trim excess fat from brisket. In a roasting pan, place onion slices, lemon slices and garlic. Lay brisket on top of vegetables. Mix together port, brown sugar, and herbs; stir until sugar dissolves, then pour evenly over brisket. Sprinkle brisket with pepper and cover roasting pan tightly with foil. Bake in a 300 degree F oven until brisket is very tender when pierced, about four hours. Brisket can be cooled and refrigerated at this point until one is ready for the finishing. When brisket is tender, uncover pan and return it to the oven (raise temperature to 450 degrees F) to brown the meat slightly, about 20 minutes. Remove brisket from pan. Skim off fat from pan juices and put in sauce pan. Boil juices and vegetables, uncovered, stirring often. As mixture thickens, reduce heat to medium and stir constantly; cook until thick and shiny, and reduced to about 1-3/4 cups (20-30 minutes). Add salt to taste. To serve, slice across the grain. Spoon marmalade over brisket. Garnish with lemon "bows" and chopped parsley if desired.

    <title>Virginia Sauer's Fridge Pickles</title>
    <category>None</category>
    <quantity>1</quantity>
    <ingredient>
      <li>1 quart Sliced unpeeled cucumbers; (1/8th - 1/4th inch thick) (about 1 1/2 pounds, or 2 1/2 cucumbers, scrubbed, ends discarded) I use a food processor for this.</li>
      <li>1/2 cups Thinly sliced onions; (about 4 ounces)</li>
      <li>2 Garlic cloves; peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Salt</li>
      <li>2 quarts (2 trays) ice cubes or crushed ice</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons Mixed pickling spices</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>This was originally posted by Virginia Sauer and is wonderful. (These are the easiest pickles I have ever made. They have a wonderful, fresh taste, and can either be processed or simply stored in the refrigerator.) . Drain sliced cucumbers on rack. . Combine cucumbers, onions, and garlic. . Add salt; mix thoroughly. . Cover with crushed ice or ice cubes. Set aside for 3 hours. . Remove garlic cloves. . Drain thoroughly in colander. . Pour sugar, vinegar, and pickling spices into 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil. . Add drained cucumber and onion spices. . If using the refrigerator pickle method (which is what I do): - Heat 15 minutes. - Pour into hot, clean jars. - Store in refrigerator. . If you are instead going to process the pickles: - Heat only 5 minutes. - Pack loosely into clean hot pint jars to 1/2-inch of top. - Adjust jar lids, and process in boiling water for 5 minutes, beginning to count processing time as soon as water in canner returns to boiling. - Remove jars and complete seals if necessary. - Set jars upright to cool. Yield: Approximately 1 Quart Variation: Although I have not yet tried this, the lady who gave me the recipe says that it can be quadrupled, using 4 quarts (6 lbs, or 10 medium) cucumbers, 1 pound (12 - 15 small white) onions, 2 large garlic cloves, 1/3 cup salt, 2 trays ice cubes, 3 cups sugar, 3 cups vinegar, 2 tablespoons mustard seed, 1/2 tablespoon celery seed, and 1/2 tablespoon turmeric).

      <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
      <li>1 package (7 1/4-ounce) Deluxe Macaroni and Cheese Dinner Mix *</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Butter or margarine; room temperature</li>
      <li>3/4 cups (3 ounces) shredded Velveeta processed American Cheese Spread</li>
      <li>1/2 cups (2 ounces) shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese **</li>
      <li>1/4 cups (1 ounce) shredded sharp cheddar cheese **</li>
      <li>3/4 cups Milk **</li>
      <li>1/4 cups Commercial sour cream **</li>
      <li>10 slices (2 1/2 x 2 1/2 x 1/2-inch) Velveeta processed American Cheese Spread</li>
      <li>I try to save the name of each contributor (especially when the recipes</li>
    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>seem original or in some way unique) and am sharing those I've tried recently from names I don't see on the list anymore. I wouldn't post Mary Spero's because she's here and active (thank goodness!) and reposts many of her wonderful recipes (and all of Mary's are keepers and I save everything she posts). * I understand that discount warehouses (such as Sam's, or Price Club) sell this cheese mix separately. If this is available to you, you can substitute 1 1/3 cups elbow macaroni and 1 1/4 ounces of the cheese mix for the Macaroni and Cheese Dinner Mix. ** The actual ratio of milk and sour cream doesn't really matter. I began adding the sour cream because I drink only skim milk, and wanted more richness in the macaroni. I have even made this using part plain yogurt. Likewise, I use whichever scraps of cheddar cheese I happen to have on hand. All sharp (or all extra sharp) will be fine. ~ -- Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. ~ -- Pour water and salt into 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil. ~ -- Stir in macaroni (1 1/3 cups, which is the amount contained in the deluxe dinner package). ~ -- Continue boiling for 7 minutes. Turn off flame under pot. ~ -- Drain macaroni in colander. (Do not rinse.) ~ -- Pour macaroni into ungreased 1 1/2-quart ovenproof casserole. ~ -- Add butter. Stir until butter melts and coats macaroni. ~ -- Add package (1 1/4 ounces) cheese sauce mix (which is the amount contained in the deluxe dinner package), grated cheeses, milk, and sour cream. Stir until thoroughly blended. (If desired, mixture can be prepared up to this point, covered with clear plastic wrap, and left at room temperature -- or refrigerated -- until ready to bake. At that time, uncover and stir ingredients until well combined.) ~ -- Arrange cheese slices over top so that they cover all of the macaroni mixture. ~ -- Bake until golden brown (approximately 1/2 hour). Yield: 4 - 6 servings N. B. To reheat leftovers, cover casserole and bake in 325 degree oven. Although I normally eschew processed cheese, the Velveeta adds a creaminess which seems impossible to achieve without it.

It was taken from a collection of Round Table recipes submitted by Table members and tried by a panel of judges before publication. Mix dry ingredients. Mix jam and melted butter and add to dry ingredients. Melt sugar in boiling water and add vinegar. Place spoonfuls of mixture into syrup (in large pyrex dish) and bake at 350F for about 45 minutes.

    </ingredient>
    <recipetext>
      <li>These are extremely low in fat, and the taste is more slightly bitter dark chocolate than the milk-chocolate sweet of most brownies, however if you love chocolate, they're a great treat! In a large bowl sift flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and packed brown sugar. In small bowl beat until creamy vanilla, almond extract, egg whites and honey. Combine and mix well. Pour into a 13 x 9 baking pan sprayed with non-stick spray. Bake at 375 (350 glass) 15-20 minutes. Poke with a toothpick and if it comes out with fudgy crumbs, it's done. Do not overbake! Cool completely before cutting into pieces. You can add chopped nuts, however it will raise the fat content substantially. From Gemini's MASSIVE MealMaster collection at www.synapse.com/~gemini</li>
